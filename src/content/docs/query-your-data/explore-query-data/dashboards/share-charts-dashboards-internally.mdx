## Share your dashboards internally [#share-dashboards-internally]

You can share any dashboard within your team using any of the following options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard. 


Or


* Copy your dashboard in <DNT>**JSON**</DNT> format as follows, and share it within your team.
    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
    2. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.
    3. Select <DNT>**Copy JSON to clipboard**</DNT>.
    4. Paste the JSON code into a message or document to share it with your team.

3. Select <DNT>**View query**</DNT> from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu of the chart. The query opens in the Query builder.
