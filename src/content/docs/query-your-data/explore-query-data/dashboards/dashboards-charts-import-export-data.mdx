[Dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) is a powerful tool to visualize and track how your system is doing, and allows you to tackle issues and plan next steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders, using the following options to import, share and export dashboards, or add and share charts (or other content) in a dashboard.


## Import, share, and export dashboards [#dashboards]

At the [dashboards index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started), you can **[import a dashboard as JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import)**.

From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink.
* Copy your dashboard **as JSON** and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the **&lt;/&gt;** icon on the right corner.
* Export your dashboard **as a pdf file** clicking the <Icon name="fe-download"/> icon.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone). 

## Add and share charts and content from your dashboards [#charts]

### Add new content to a dashboard [#charts-add]

You can add new content to any dashboard from the [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) and [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder) features.

Also, in a given dashboard, to add content:
* Click the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button at the top right corner, then create new content by clicking the **Add widget** button. Add a new chart using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or add text, images, or links using our [markdown editor](#markdown).
* Use the **+ Add to your dashboard** button.

From any chart, use the chart action menu on the upper right corner to **copy or duplicate** the chart.

### Troubleshooting chart errors [#chart-error-messages]

When adding charts you may come across these error messages:

<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style={{ width: "400px" }}>
           **Error message**
        </th>
        <th style={{ width: "400px" }}>
            **Description**
        </th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            External Service 'NRDB' execution resulted in 400 - cause: TIMESERIES step size is larger than the current time window.
          </td>

          <td>
            The [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-timeseries) step size is larger than the selected time window. Modify the step and run the query again.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            External Service 'NRDB' execution resulted in 400 - cause: Your query's start time must be before its end time.
          </td>

          <td>
            The provided `startTime` of the query must be before the `endTime`. Modify it and run the query again.
          </td>
        </tr>

          <td>

### Share your charts and markdown content [#charts-share]

From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to:

* Share your chart as a **PNG image** or with **a link**. Go to the chart menu and select either the **Get as image** or **Get chart link** options.
* For table charts only, **export as a `.csv` file**. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. 
* Copy the chart to any dashboard.
