You can use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) to visualalize and track your system's health, tackle issues, and plan any further steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders with various import and export options.

## Import a dashboard as JSON [#import-json]

You can import a dashboard as JSON when you want to modify an out-of-the-box dashboard at the code level. For example, if you want to create a custom dashboard by merging two existing dashboards together, you can modify a base dashboard’s JSON and then import it back to New Relic.

To import a dashboard as JSON:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Open an existing dashboard’s JSON by click the <DoNotTranslate>**...**</DoNotTranslate>, then select <DoNotTranslate>**Copy JSON**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Go back to the <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> page.
4. In the top-right corner, click <DoNotTranslate>**Import dashboard**</DoNotTranslate>.
5. Paste your JSON code.
6. Choose the account and permission settings for the dashboard. You can’t change the account once you’ve set it, but you can [change the permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-settings) at any time. 
7. Click <DoNotTranslate>**Save**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Export a dashboard as PDF [#export-dashboards-pdf]

To export your dashboard as a PDF file, in the dashboard's top right corner, click <DoNotTranslate>**...**</DoNotTranslate> and select <DoNotTranslate>**Export dashboard as PDF**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Export a chart as CSV [#export-charts-csv]

To export a dashboard's table chart as a CSV file, in the chart's top right corner, click <DoNotTranslate>**...**</DoNotTranslate> and select <DoNotTranslate>**Export as CSV**</DoNotTranslate>.

While powerful, exporting as a CSV has limitations. A few things to keep in mind:

* Data always exports in UTC time (-7:00)
* Export doesn't support aggregator functions like `average()`
* Export doesn't support the `COMPARE_WITH` clause

## Share a dashboard with your team [#share-dashboards]

From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard. Keep in mind that these links expire if they are not used in a six-month period. 
* Copy your dashboard <DoNotTranslate>**as JSON**</DoNotTranslate> and add it to the clipboard by clicking the <DoNotTranslate>**...**</DoNotTranslate> button in the top right and selecting <DoNotTranslate>**Copy JSON to clipboard**</DoNotTranslate>.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone).

## Query and explore charts [#explore-chart-data]

For details about what you can do with the charts, see [Querying and charting options](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#data-analysis).
