You can use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) to visual and track how your system is doing, tackle issues, and plan next steps. Learn to share all that information with your team, customers, or other stakeholders with various import and export options.

## Import, share, and export dashboards [#dashboards]

### Import dashboards

At the [dashboards index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started), you can **[import a dashboard as JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import)**.

### Export dashboards 


You can export your dashboard as either a comma-seperated file(CSV) or a PDF. 

<Tabs>
	<TabsBar>
        <TabsBarItem id="1">
            Export CSV
        </TabsBarItem>
        <TabsBarItem id="2">
            Export PDF
        </TabsBarItem>
    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="1">

From any dashboard, export charts as CSVs by clicking the dropdown in the top right of a chart and selecting **Export as CSV**. This will download your data as a CSV. 

While powerful, exporting as a CSV has limitations. A few things to keep in mind:
* Data always exports in UTC time (-7:00)
* Export does not support aggregator functions like `average()`
* Export does not support the `COMPARE_WITH` clause

        </TabsPageItem>
        <TabsPageItem id="2">

Export your dashboard as a pdf file by clicking the `...` button in the top right and selecting **Export dashboard as PDF.**

        </TabsPageItem>
    </TabsPages>
</Tabs>


### Share dashboards
From any dashboard, share it with one of these options:

* Copy the dashboard's permalink by clicking the link icon in the top right of a dashboard. Permalinks share a direct link to the dashboard.
* Copy your dashboard **as JSON** and add it to the clipboard by clicking the `...` button in the top right and selecting **Copy JSON to clipboard**.

You can also [duplicate your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-clone).

## Add new content to a dashboard [#charts-add]

You can add new content in the form of [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) to any dashboard through the [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder) feature.

Also, in a given dashboard, to add content:

* Click the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button at the top right corner, then create new content by clicking the **Add widget** button. Add a new chart using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or add text, images, or links using our [markdown editor](#markdown).
* Use the **+ Add to your dashboard** button.

From any chart, use the chart action menu on the upper right corner to **copy or duplicate** the chart.

### Troubleshooting chart errors [#chart-error-messages]

When adding charts you may come across these error messages:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "400px" }}>
        **Error message**
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "400px" }}>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        External Service 'NRDB' execution resulted in 400 - cause: TIMESERIES step size is larger than the current time window.
      </td>

      <td>
        The [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-timeseries) step size is larger than the selected time window. Modify the step and run the query again.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
