When you share dashboards or charts publicly via live URLs, it exposes sensitive data to external viewers, so it's critical to manage access and permissions carefully. Ensure you have the following setups as per your requirement to securely share dashboards and charts. 

A user with any [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/) can enable and manage user access to public sharing. However, the user must be in at least one group that has Authentication Domain Manage[administation setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) enabled. 

## Policy enablement [#policy-enablement]
For sharing dashboards publicly, the Authentication domain manager needs to check and enable the <DNT>**Live URL Creation**</DNT> policy at the account level. This is not applicable to chart sharing. The Authentication domain manager can check the status of this policy in accounts, and enable or disable it only via NerdGraph API.

    As an Authentication Domain Manager, you can check the current status of the <DNT>**Live URL Creation**</DNT> policy in specific accounts. Use the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql) to construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) as follows. Replace `1, 2` with actual account IDs. If you don't provide the account IDs, the call returns the status of your authorized account. You can query up to 100 accounts simultaneously.

      ```graphql
      {
        actor {
          dashboard {
            liveUrlCreationPolicies(filter: {
              accountIds: [1, 2]
            }) {
              liveUrlCreationPolicies {
                accountId
                liveUrlCreationAllowed          
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    This is a sample response.

      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "actor": {
            "dashboard": {
              "liveUrlCreationPolicies": {
                "liveUrlCreationPolicies": [
                  {
                    "accountId": 1,
                    "liveUrlCreationAllowed": true
                  },
                  {
                    "accountId": 2,
                    "liveUrlCreationAllowed": false
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    As an Authentication Domain Manager, you can enable or disable the <DNT>**Live URL Creation**</DNT> policy in specific accounts. Ensure you have authorization for these accounts. Use the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql) to construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) as given here with the following changes:
    * Replace `1, 2` with actual account IDs.
    * Set `liveUrlCreationAllowed` to `true` to enable the policy, or `false` to disable it.

    You can query up to 100 accounts simultaneously. Each successful update triggers an audit event for the corresponding account ID.

      ```graphql
      mutation {
        dashboardUpdateLiveUrlCreationPolicies(
          policies: {
            accountIds: [1, 2], 
            liveUrlCreationAllowed: true}
        ) {
          liveUrlCreationPolicies {
            accountId
            liveUrlCreationAllowed
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    This is a sample response. If you have provided an unknown account ID, the response will show `UNAUTHORIZED` error code.

      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "dashboardUpdateLiveUrlCreationPolicies": {
            "liveUrlCreationPolicies": [
              {
                "accountId": 1,
                "liveUrlCreationAllowed": true
              },
              {
                "accountId": 2,
                "liveUrlCreationAllowed": true
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```

## Access management [#access-management]

As an Authentication Domain Manager, perform the following steps to grant access to a user for [managing live dashboard and chart URLs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#dashboard). Check with the user about their specific needs and accordingly do the configuration. To learn more about user management, refer to [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/).

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Add permissions to a custom role [#permissions-to-custom-role]
    [Create a new custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) with the following permissions, or add them to an existing role. Check with the user to understand the level of access required. 
       * `Live Url (all)`: Access details of live URLs for all users.
           * `View`: Can see all live URL details.
           * `Delete`: Can revoke any live URL.
       * `Live Url (individual)`: Access details of live URLs owned by the user.
            * `View`: Can see own live URL details.
           * `Modify`: Can update the properties of the live URLs.
           * `Delete`: Can revoke own live URLs.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add user, role, and account to a group [#group-access]
    For dashboard sharing configuration, [create a new group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#group-access) or manage an existing group as follows:
        1. Navigate to **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Access Management > Groups**.
        2. Click <DNT>**Create a new group**</DNT>, or select <DNT>**Manage group access**</DNT> from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu of an existing group.
        3. For a new group, provide a name and click <DNT>**Create group**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> pane for the group opens.
        3. Under <DNT>**Members**</DNT>, add the user.
        4. Under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT>, associate the custom role with the desired account for dashboard sharing.
        3. If the dashboard is sourced from multiple accounts, under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT>, include the custom role for each relevant account within the group.
          <Callout variant="tip">
            Ensure you have the sharing capabilities defined for all accounts queried in the dashboard.
          </Callout>
  </Step>

</Steps>
