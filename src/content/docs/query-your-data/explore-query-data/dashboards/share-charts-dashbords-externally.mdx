In New Relic, you can share dashboards and charts with viewers outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. This feature expands the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboards and charts are accessible via publicly accessible live URLs that you create from the New Relic platform.

When external users access the shared dashboards or charts, the page renders with the same data and visualizations as the original entity, with the following interactive capabilities:
* **Time range**: Viewers can pick the time range from a drop-down to see data for a specific period.
* **View mode**: Viewers can select light or dark mode depending on their preference.
* **TV mode**: Viewers can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen.

Each time viewers access the live URLs, it consumes your allocated [CCU](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) limit. If usage exceeds this limit, [additional charges](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) may apply.


<Callout variant="caution"> Anyone with the live dashboard or chart URLs can view all the information from the dashboard or chart. Share information carefully and in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures.</Callout>

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites-public-dashboard]
This feature includes multiple security layers and conditions to ensure controlled and secure data sharing. To share dashboards or charts publicly, ensure the following setup is in place. Refer to the [Security and access management](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) for setup details:
* The `Live url control` permission is enabled for the account with the dashboard.
* The custom role and permissions are configured for you to share dashboards and charts.
* The accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart are having grants for your role to share data externally.
* You have access to all accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart.
* You are the owner of the dashboard or chart you want to share.
* The [dashboard permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions) is not set to <DNT>**Private**</DNT>.


## Share your dashboard [#share-dashboard]
You can share your dashboard by generating a live dashboard URL and managing its expiration duration. Additionally, you can view the list of generated URLs with details and revoke them at any time from the New Relic platform. To ensure security and compliance, monitor the audit trail for creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs.

<Callout variant="tip">You can also create and manage live dashboard URLs through the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-live-dashboard-urls-via-api). </Callout>

### Create a live dashboard URL [#create-dashboard-url]
To create a publicly accessible live URL for your dashboard:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. In the top-right corner, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
4. Select <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT>. A confirmation message appears to acknowledge the following::
    * The dashboard does not contain sensitive information.
    * Accessing this shared dashboard from the live URL each time may consume your CCU.
5. Click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
6. Assign a duration for the URL to be live. The URL expires after the specified duration.
7. Click <DNT>**Save changes**</DNT>. A notification appears about the successful creation of the URL, and it is copied to your clipboard.
8. To render the shared dashboard page, click the notification, or manually browse it in a new tab with the copied URL.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content update in the actual dashboard on the New relic platform reflects in the shared dashboard page.
</Callout>

### Update live URL duration [#update-dashboard-url]
Ensure you have the necessary [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to update the live URL duration. To update the duration:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
1. Open the dashboard you are sharing.
2. Click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
3. Select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
4. Update the duration from the <DNT>**Link expiration**</DNT> drop-down. The <DNT>**Never expires**</DNT> option keeps the URL live for 30 years.
5. Click <DNT>**Save changes**</DNT>.

### View the shared dashboards [#view-dashboard-links]
You can access shared dashboard names hyperlinked with their live URLs, all in one place on New Relic One. Depending on your [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can view either the URLs you have created or those created by all users in the account.

To view the shared dashboard links:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.
2. In the left navigation, click your name at the bottom.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**Administration > Shared Dashboards**</DNT>. The Shared Dashboards page provides a list of shared dashboards, including their creation and expiration dates, and the owner of each dashboard.

You can click the dashboard names to open the sharing pages in a new tab.

### Revoke a live dashboard URL [#revoke-dashboard-url]
Depending on your [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can revoke either the links you have created or those created by all users in the account. You can do this in the following ways:
* On the dashboard you are sharing, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon and select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. In the <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog, select <DNT>**Revoke public link**</DNT>.
* From the <DNT>**[Shared Dashboards](#view-dashboard-links)**</DNT> page, select the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the dashboard link and click <DNT>**Revoke**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the owner can delete a dashboard with a publicly shared link. Deleting the dashboard automatically revokes the public sharing link. If you restore the dashboard, you need to create a new live URL.
</Callout>

### Audit trail and logging [#audit-trail-dashboard]
Creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs generates an audit trail in the [NrAuditEvent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent/). To view the records in the query builder:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Query Your Data](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core)**</DNT>.
2. From <DNT>**Account**</DNT> dropdown of the query builder tab, select the account from which the public dashboard links are created.
4. Run any of the following queries to view the audit trails:

      title="Get details of the live dashboard URLs created or revoked in the last hour."
