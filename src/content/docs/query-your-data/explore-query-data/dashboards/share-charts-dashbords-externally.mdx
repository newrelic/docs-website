In New Relic, you can share dashboards and charts with viewers outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. This feature expands the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboards and charts are accessible via publicly accessible live URLs that you create from the New Relic platform.

When external users access the shared dashboards or charts, the page renders with the same data and visualizations as the original entity, with the only interactive capability being the adjustment of the time range. Each time viewers access the live URLs, it consumes your allocated CCU limit.


    <Callout variant="caution"> Anyone with the live dashboard or chart URLs can view all the information from the dashboard or chart. Share information carefully and in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures.</Callout>

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites-public-dashboard]
This feature includes multiple security layers and conditions to ensure controlled and secure data sharing. To share dashboards or charts publicly, ensure the following setup is in place. Refer to the [Security and access management](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) for setup details:
* The `Live url control` permission is enabled for the account with the dashboard.
* The custom role and permissions are configured for you to share dashboards and charts.
* The accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart are having grants for your role to share data externally.
* You have access to all accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart.
* You are the owner of the dashboard or chart you want to share.
* The [dashboard permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions) is not set to <DNT>**Private**</DNT>.


## Share your dashboard
You can share your dashboard by generating a live dashboard URL and managing its expiration duration. Additionally, you can view the list of generated URLs with details and revoke them at any time from the New Relic platform. To ensure security and compliance, monitor the audit trail for creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs.

    <Callout variant="caution">You can also create and manage live dashboard URLs through the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-live-dashoard-urls-via-api). </Callout>

### Create a public link
To create a sharable link for your dashboard:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. In the top-right corner, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
4. Select <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT>. A confirmation message appears to get your aknowledgement on the following:
    * The dashboard does not contain sensitive information.
    * Accessing this shared dashboard from the unique link each time may consume your CCU.
5. To aknowledge, click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
6. Assign a duration for the unique link to be shared. The link will expire after the specified duration.
7. Click <DNT>**Save changes**</DNT>. A notification appears about the successful creation of the public link. It is also copied to your clipboard.
You can click the notification, or manually paste the link in a new tab. The shared dashboard page appears with the same data and visualizations as the original.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content update in the dashboard on New relic platform reflects in the shared dashboard page.
</Callout>

### Update link expiration duration
Make sure you have the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custome-role) to modify the shared dashboard URL. To update the expiration duration:
1. Go to the dashboard you are sharing.
2. Click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
3. Select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
4. Update the expiration duration.
5. Click <DNT>**Save changes**</DNT>. A notification appears about the successful update of the expiration duration.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The <DNT>**Never expires**</DNT> option allows the link to remain active for an extended period, typically set to a duration like 30 years.
</Callout>

### View the shared dashboard links
You can view the shared dasboard names with its creation and expiration dates, and owners at one place. 
Depending upon the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custome-role), you can either view the links only you have created or links created by all the users in the account.

To view the shared dashboard links:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.
2. From the left navigation, click your name at the bottom.
3. Click <DNT>**Administration > Shared Dashboards**</DNT>. The Shared Dashboards page appears with the list of shared dashboard links.
The dashboard names are hyperlinked. You can click it open the shared dashboard page in a new tab. You can also view the creation and expiration dates, and the owner of the dashboard.

### Revoke a shared link
Depending upon the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custome-role), you can either revoke the links only you have created or the links created by all the users in the account. You can do it in the following ways:
* On the dashboard you are sharing, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon and select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears. Select  <DNT>**Revoke public link**</DNT>.
* From the Shared Dashboards page, select <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the dashboard link and click <DNT>**Revoke**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the owner can delete a dashboard with a publicly shared link. Deleting the dashboard automatically revokes the public sharing link. If you restore the dashboard, you need to create a new public link.
</Callout>

### Audit trail and logging
Creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs generates audit trail in the [NrAuditEvent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent/). To view the record in the query builder:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.coms](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.
2. To open the query builder, select <DNT>**Query your data**</DNT> from the bottom.
3. Select the account from which the public dashboard links are created.
4. Run any of the following queries to view the audit trails:
