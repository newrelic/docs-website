In New Relic you can share dashboards and charts with viewers outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. 
This feature helps expand the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboards and charts are accessible through unique links those you can create from the New Relic platform.
When the external user access the shared dashboards or charts, the page is rendered with the same data and visualizations as the original entity, with the only interactive capability to adjust the time range. 
Each time the shared link is accessed, it consumes from your CCU limit.


<Callout variant="caution">
  Anyone with the unique link will be able to view the information on the shared dashboard or chart. Share information carefully and in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures.
