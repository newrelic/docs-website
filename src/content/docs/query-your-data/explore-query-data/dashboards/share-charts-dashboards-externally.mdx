In New Relic, you can share dashboards and charts with viewers outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. This feature expands the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboards and charts are accessible via publicly accessible live URLs that you create from the New Relic platform. While creating URLs for sharing dashboards, you have the option to enable password protection, which adds an extra layer of security to the shared content. However, there is no password protection feature available for chart URLs.

When external users access the shared dashboards or charts, the page renders with the same data and visualizations as the original entity, with the following interactive capabilities:
* **Time range**: Viewers can pick the time range from a drop-down to see data for a specific period.
* **View mode**: Viewers can select light or dark mode depending on their preference.
* **TV mode**: Viewers can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen.

<Callout variant="important">While the chart sharing feature is available to **Pro**, **Enterprise**, and **Core Compute** customers, the dashboard sharing feature is available only to **Pro** and **Enterprise** customers with **[Advanced Compute](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing)** enabled. To learn more about the associated costs and management practices for the dashboard sharing feature, refer to the [Pricing](#public-dashboard-pricing) section.</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution"> Anyone with access to live dashboard URLs without password protection, or chart URLs, can view all the information contained within them. Share information carefully in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures. To enhance security, consider using the password protection feature for dashboards, as this option is not available for chart URLs.</Callout>

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites-public-dashboard]
This feature includes multiple security layers and conditions to ensure controlled and secure data sharing. To share dashboards or charts publicly, ensure the following setup is in place. Refer to the [Security and access management](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) for setup details:
* The `Live URL control` permission is enabled for all accounts sourcing the dashboard.
* The custom role and permissions are configured for you to share dashboards and charts.
* The accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart have grants for your role to share data externally.
* You have access to all accounts sourcing the dashboard or chart.
* You are the owner of the dashboard or chart you want to share.
* The [dashboard permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions) is not set to <DNT>**Private**</DNT>.

    ## Share your dashboard [#share-dashboard]
You can share your dashboard by generating a live dashboard URL and managing its expiration duration. Additionally, you can enable password protection for enhanced security when sharing dashboards. You can also view the list of generated URLs with details and revoke them at any time from the New Relic platform. To ensure security and compliance, monitor the audit trail for creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs.

<Callout variant="tip">You can create and manage live dashboard URLs through both the UI and the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-live-dashboard-urls-via-api). </Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url" title="Create a live dashboard URL with or without password protection from the UI">
 To create a publicly accessible live URL for your dashboard:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. In the top-right corner, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
4. Select <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT>. A confirmation message appears to acknowledge the following:
    * The dashboard does not contain sensitive information.
    * Accessing this shared dashboard from the live URL each time may consume your CCU.
5. Click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears. Do the following changes if needed:
    * The <DNT>**Protect with a password**</DNT> toggle is on by default. You can turn it off if you want to share the dashboard without a password.
    * 30 days is the default duration for which the live URL is valid. You can change it to a different duration from the <DNT>**Link expiration**</DNT> drop-down.
6. Save your changes. The URL is now created. You can copy it from the dialog.
8. If the password protection toggle is on, you must click <DNT>**Copy password**</DNT> and save it securely. This password is available only once and can't be retrieved later. You need to share the password with the URL to allow external users to access the dashboard.
9. After you copy the URL and password, close the dialog.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content updates made to the actual dashboard on the New Relic platform are automatically reflected on the shared dashboard page. To prevent accidental data exposure, only the dashboard owner can update a publicly shared dashboard.

</Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="update-live-url" title="Update link expiry duration for the live dashboard URL">
 Ensure you have the necessary [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), and you are the owner of the dashboard, to update the live duration of the shared dashboard.
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
1. Open the dashboard you are sharing.
2. Click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
3. Select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
4. Update the duration from the <DNT>**Link expiration**</DNT> drop-down. The <DNT>**Never expires**</DNT> option keeps the URL live for 30 years.
5. Save your changes and close the dialog.

<Collapser id="password-live-url" title="Manage password protection for the live dashboard URL">
 Ensure you have the necessary [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), and you are the owner of the dashboard, to enable or disable password protection for the live dashboard URL.
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
1. Open the dashboard you are sharing.
2. Click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
3. Select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears.
4. Use the <DNT>**Protect with a password**</DNT> toggle to enable or disable password protection. If you disable password protection, the existing password is removed, and external users can access the dashboard without a password.
5. For a password-protected URL, you can change the password by clicking <DNT>**Reset password**</DNT>.
6. Save your changes.
7. If you enable password protection or reset it, on the <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog, you must click <DNT>**Copy password**</DNT> and save it securely. This password is available only once and can't be retrieved later. You need to share the password with the URL to allow external users to access the dashboard.
8. Close the dialog.

### Best practices for password management
* **Secure storage**: Copy and securely store the generated password immediately after creating or resetting it. New Relic doesn't store or allow retrieval of the password after the initial display.
* **Sharing**: Use secure methods to distribute the password to your intended audience, such as internal password managers, secure messaging, or one-time secret services. Avoid insecure channels like plain text email.
* **Complexity**: Passwords are auto-generated in complex format to enhance security. Before protecting the URL with a password, ensure the complexity aligns with the audience's ability to handle the password.
* **Suspected compromise**: If you suspect the password has been compromised, either you can reset the password, or [revoke](#revoke-dashboard-url) the live URL to prevent further access. If you are revoking the URL, you need to [create a new live URL](#create-dashboard-url) and share with the audience again. If you reset the password, you need to share the new password with the audience.

<Collapser id="view-dashboard-links" title="View the shared dashboards">
 You can access shared dashboard names hyperlinked with their live URLs, all in one place on New Relic One. Depending on your [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can view either the URLs you have created or those created by all users in the account.

To view the shared dashboard links:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.
2. In the left navigation, click your name at the bottom.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**Administration > Shared Dashboards**</DNT>. The Shared Dashboards page provides a list of shared dashboards, including their creation and expiration dates, and the owner of each dashboard.

You can click the dashboard names to open the sharing pages in a new tab.

<Collapser id="access-dashboard-as-a-user" title="As an external user, access a shared dashboard">
As an external user, you need a live dashboard URL from the dashboard owner to access the shared dashboard. If the URL is password-protected, you also need the password. The following two security based controls are embeded with password-protected URLs:
* **Session-based access**: After accessing the dashboard, the session remains active for 3 hours. If you try to access the dashboard after this period, or the browser session expires, you need to re-enter the password.
* **reCAPTCHA verification**: If you have multiple failed attempts to access the dashboard, you need to complete a reCAPTCHA verification before entering the password again.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="revoke-dashboard-url" title="Revoke a live dashboard URL">
 Depending on your [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can revoke either the links you have created or those created by all users in the account. You can do this in the following ways:
* On the dashboard you are sharing, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon and select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT>. In the <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog, select <DNT>**Revoke public link**</DNT>.
* From the <DNT>**[Shared Dashboards](#view-dashboard-links)**</DNT> page, select the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the dashboard link and click <DNT>**Revoke**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the owner can delete a dashboard with a publicly shared link. Deleting the dashboard automatically revokes the public sharing link. If you restore the dashboard, you need to create a new live URL.

<Collapser id="audit-trail-dashboard" title="Audit trail and logging">
 Creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs generates an audit trail in the [NrAuditEvent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent/). To view the records in the query builder:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Query Your Data](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core)**</DNT>.
2. Select the account from which the public dashboard links are created.
4. Run any of the following queries to view the audit trails:

<Collapser id="public-dashboard-pricing" title="Pricing">
When using live dashboard URLs, it's important to understand the associated costs and how to manage them effectively. <DNT>**Public Dashboards**</DNT> is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when queries are executed from the dashboard visualizations, which happens in the following cases:
* On page load
* On time picker changes
* On refresh-rate triggers

You can monitor your usage costs from **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Compute Management > Advanced capabilities**.
### Cost management practices
To keep your pricing optimal, consider the following standard practices:
* [**Access control**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts):
  Manage who can create, edit, or delete links at both the account and user-role levels. This helps control and prevent users from having excessive access to these capabilities.
* [**Link expiration management**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#update-live-url):
  Set expiration times for links to ensure they are only visible for a certain period, reducing potential overuse.
* **Widget management**:
  * Add or remove widgets from your internal dashboard to optimize the data being queried.
  * Update widgets to ignore time picker changes, preventing additional queries when users adjust the time range.
  * Manage the refresh rate of each widget to prevent automatic refreshes, aligning with your internal dashboard preferences. For more details, refer to  [Customize chart refresh rates](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/chart-refresh-rates/#customize-chart-refresh).

  ### Limitations
    Following are the limitations of sharing dashboards publicly:
    * When viewing a shared dashboard in <DNT>**TV mode**</DNT>, it stays active for up to 72 hours. The viewer needs to refresh the browser to continue viewing.
    * If you are share a dashboard with widgets that use template variables, facet linking, custom visualizations, or log tables, these widgets will not display any information in the shared view.
    * If the dashboard's permission setting is <DNT>**Private**</DNT>, you can't share the dashboard publicly. To verify this, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT> > Your dashboard > <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon > <DNT>**Settings > Permissions**</DNT>.
