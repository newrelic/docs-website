In New Relic, you can share dashboards and charts with viewers outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. This feature expands the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboards and charts are accessible via publicly accessible live URLs that you create from the New Relic platform.

Imagine your company provides a critical backend service to a major business customer. During a service disruption, this customer needs timely and accurate status updates. Instead of sending periodic, static email updates, you can provide them with a direct, real-time view of the situation.
Your engineering team has a New Relic dashboard that monitors the health of the service, showing metrics like transaction throughput and error rates. When an issue arises, your account manager shares the secure, password-protected URL for this dashboard directly with the customer's technical lead.

By sharing the link, you give your customer a live, transparent view of the recovery process. They can see the metrics improve as your team deploys fixes, which reduces their need to request status updates and builds significant trust. The value is in the direct, secure sharing of the URL itself, providing a single source of truth during a critical event.


To add an extra layer of security to the shared content, currently only for dashboards, you can enable password protection. This ensures that only users with the URL and the password can access the shared content.


When external users access the shared dashboards or charts, the page renders with the same data and visualizations as the original entity, with the following interactive capabilities:
* **Time range**: Viewers can pick the time range from a drop-down to see data for a specific period.
* **View mode**: Viewers can select light or dark mode depending on their preference.
* **TV mode**: Viewers can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen.

<Callout variant="important">While the chart sharing feature is available to **Pro**, **Enterprise**, and **Core Compute** customers, the dashboard sharing feature is available only to **Pro** and **Enterprise** customers with **[Advanced Compute](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing)** enabled. To learn more about the associated costs and management practices for the dashboard sharing feature, refer to the [Pricing](#access-dashboard-as-a-user) section.</Callout>

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites-public-dashboard]
This feature includes multiple security layers and conditions to ensure controlled and secure data sharing. To share dashboards or charts publicly, ensure the following setup is in place.

    ## Share your dashboard [#share-dashboard]
You can share your dashboard by generating a live dashboard URL and managing its expiration duration. Additionally, you can enable password protection for enhanced security when sharing dashboards. You can also view the list of generated URLs with details and revoke them at any time from the New Relic platform. To ensure security and compliance, monitor the audit trail for creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs.

<Callout variant="caution"> If a shared dashboard is not password-protected, anyone with the live URL can access it and view all the information contained within it. To avoid unwanted access, make sure to enable [password protection](#password-live-url) when creating the URL.</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">You can create and manage live dashboard URLs through both the UI and the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-live-dashboard-urls-via-api). </Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url" title="Create an URL with/without password protection">
 To create a publicly accessible live URL for your dashboard:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. In the top-right corner, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon.
4. Select <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT>. A confirmation message appears to acknowledge the following:
    * The dashboard does not contain sensitive information.
    * Accessing this shared dashboard from the live URL each time may consume your CCU.
5. Click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog appears. Do the following changes if needed:
    * The <DNT>**Protect with a password**</DNT> toggle is on by default. If you want to share the dashboard without a password, you can turn it off.
    * 30 days is the default duration for which the live URL is valid. You can change it to a different duration from the <DNT>**Link expiration**</DNT> drop-down.
6. Save your changes. The URL is now created. You can copy the public URL from the dialog.
8. If the password protection toggle is on, you must copy the password and save it. This password is available only once and can't be retrieved later. You need to share the password with the URL to allow external users to access the dashboard. To manage the password, refer to the [password management best practices](#password-management).
9. After you copy the URL and password, close the dialog.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content updates made to the actual dashboard on the New Relic platform are automatically reflected on the shared dashboard page. To prevent accidental data exposure, only the dashboard owner can update a publicly shared dashboard.

</Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="update-live-url" title="Manage URL expiration">
 To update the live duration of the shared dashboard, ensure you have the necessary [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), and you are the owner of the dashboard.

<Collapser id="view-dashboard-links" title="View shared URLs in New Relic platform">
 You can access shared dashboard names hyperlinked with their live URLs, all in one place on New Relic One. Depending on your [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can view either the URLs you have created or those created by all users in the account.

To view the shared dashboard URLs:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.
2. In the left navigation, click your name at the bottom.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**Administration > Shared Dashboards**</DNT>. The Shared Dashboards page provides a list of shared dashboards, including their creation and expiration dates, and the owner of each dashboard.

You can click the dashboard names to open the sharing pages in a new tab.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="access-dashboard-as-a-user" title="Share dashboards externally">
Share the live dashboard URL with external users to allow them to access the shared dashboard. If the URL is password-protected, also share the password with them. For the external users, following two security based controls are embedded with password-protected URLs:

* **Session-based access**: After accessing the dashboard, the session remains active for 120 hours. If they try to access the dashboard after this period, or the browser session expires, they need to re-enter the password. If there is a password reset, the session expires as soon as the widgets are refreshed again. The external users need to re-enter the new password.

* **reCAPTCHA verification**: If they have multiple failed attempts to access the dashboard, they need to complete a reCAPTCHA verification before entering the password again.

### Pricing [#public-dashboard-pricing]

When sharing live dashboard URLs, it's important to understand the associated costs and how to manage them effectively. <DNT>**Public Dashboards**</DNT> is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when queries are executed from the dashboard visualizations, which happens in the following cases:
* On page load
* On time picker changes
* On refresh-rate triggers

You can monitor your usage costs from **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Compute Management > Advanced capabilities**. To optimize your costs, refer to the [pricing management best practices](#pricing-management) section.

<Collapser id="revoke-dashboard-url" title="Revoke URLs">
 Depending on your [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can revoke either the URLs you have created or those created by all users in the account. You can do this in the following ways:
* On the dashboard you are sharing, click the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> icon > select <DNT>**Manage public link**</DNT> > in the <DNT>**Share dashboard**</DNT> dialog, select <DNT>**Revoke public link**</DNT> > Confirm the revocation.
* From the <DNT>**[Shared Dashboards](#view-dashboard-links)**</DNT> page, select the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the dashboard link > click <DNT>**Revoke**</DNT> > Confirm the revocation.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the owner can delete a dashboard with a publicly shared URL. Deleting the dashboard automatically revokes the public sharing URL. If you restore the dashboard, you need to create a new live URL.
</Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="audit-trail-dashboard" title="Audit trail and logging">
 Creating, updating, or revoking shared dashboard URLs generates an audit trail in the [NrAuditEvent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent/). To view the records in the query builder:
1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Query Your Data](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core)**</DNT>.
2. Select the account from which the public dashboard URLs are created.
4. Run any of the following queries to view the audit trails:

  ### Best practices [#best-practices]

  To manage public dashboard related pricing and password security efficiently, follow these best practices:

  <CollapserGroup>

    <Collapser id="pricing-management" title="Pricing management">
    To keep your pricing optimal, consider the following standard practices:
    * [**Access control**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts):
    Manage who can create, edit, or delete URLs at both the account and user-role levels. This helps control and prevent users from having excessive access to these capabilities.
    * [**Link expiration management**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#update-live-url): Set expiration times for URLs to ensure they are only visible for a certain period, reducing potential overuse.
    * **Widget management**:
      * Add or remove widgets from your internal dashboard to optimize the data being queried.
      * Update widgets to ignore time picker changes, preventing additional queries when users adjust the time range.
      * Manage the refresh rate of each widget to prevent automatic refreshes, aligning with your internal dashboard preferences. For more details, refer to [Customize chart refresh rates](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/chart-refresh-rates/#customize-chart-refresh).

  </Collapser>

    <Collapser id="password-management" title="Password management">

    To ensure secure password management for live dashboard URLs, follow these best practices:

    * **Secure Storage**: Copy and securely store the generated password immediately after creating or resetting it. New Relic doesn't store or allow retrieval of the password after the initial display.
    * **Sharing**: Use secure methods to distribute the password to your intended audience, such as internal password managers, secure messaging, or one-time secret services. Avoid insecure channels like plain text email.
    * **Complexity**: Passwords are auto-generated in complex format to enhance security. Before protecting the URL with a password, ensure the complexity aligns with the audience's ability to handle the password.
    * **Suspected Compromise**: If you suspect the password has been compromised, either reset the password or revoke the live URL to prevent further access. If revoking the URL, create a new live URL and share it with the audience again. If resetting the password, share the new password with the audience.

  ### Limitations [#limitations-public-dashboard]
    Following are the limitations of sharing dashboards publicly:
    * When viewing a shared dashboard in <DNT>**TV mode**</DNT>, it stays active for up to 72 hours. The viewer needs to refresh the browser to continue viewing.
    * If you are share a dashboard with widgets that use template variables, facet linking, custom visualizations, or log tables, these widgets will not display any information in the shared view.
    * If the dashboard's permission setting is <DNT>**Private**</DNT>, you can't share the dashboard publicly. To verify this, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**</DNT> > Your dashboard > <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon > <DNT>**Settings > Permissions**</DNT>.
