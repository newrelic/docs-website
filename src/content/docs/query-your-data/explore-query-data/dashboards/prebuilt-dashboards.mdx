The first step to improving your stack is understanding your data. Once you've started ingesting data using one of our APM agents, you need to organize all the information that is now funneling directly from your application to New Relic. You can monitor metrics, events, logs, and transactions by creating [custom data visualizations](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) with NRQL, our New Relic query language. But sometimes you don't have time to build the exact dashboard you need, or you might not even know what data you should be monitoring. We have a collection of recommended pre-built dashboards to help you instantly visualize your data for common use cases.

## Dashboards tailored for your stack

To make full use of every tool New Relic has to offer you can install pre-built dashboards that fit your business needs. If you run an ecommerce site and you want to understand any potential revenue risk, you can install the dashboard `Customer experience bottom of the funnel analysis` which automatically monitors orders, checkout, latency, and tracks promotions. Or if you're a DevOps engineer and you want to make sure your hosts and servers don't get overwhelmed, you can install our `Infrastructure Dashboard` to quickly analyze CPU and memory and make changes.

    ### Connect your data  [#install]

    It's important to instrument your data sources before using our dashboards. If you're just starting out, follow these instructions. If you already have everything you want to monitor connected to New Relic move on to the next step.

    To monitor your application's performance, you'll use an agent created specifically for your app's language. Clicking a logo sends you to New Relic platform where you'll be guided through installing and configuring the agent.

    Once you've installed an agent, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT> and select your app. If you don't see much data just yet, step away for a while and let the agent gather real-time data as your application runs.

    ### Tell us about your stack [#your-stack]

    We will always recommend dashboards we think might be a good fit for your team but if you're looking for a tailored experience that highlights _specific_ dashboards that target your application's unique needs, we recommend telling us a little about how your stack was built.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      The top banner of the Integrations & Agents page shows [gaps](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/alert-coverage-gaps/) in your monitoring. Our infrastructure agent automatically discovers services, applications, and log sources running in your environment. It also guides you through installation to help you get full visibility of your stack. Select the <DNT>**See gaps**</DNT> link to get started.
