Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. Dashboards in [New Relic](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in our platform.

/>

## Why it matters [#dashboards-features]

With our dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting.

Use dashboards to:

* Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI.
* Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see [Data collection](/docs/using-new-relic/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data).
* [Add custom attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/add-custom-attributes-new-relic-apm-data) or [send custom event types](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api) to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc.
* [Manage your charts and dashboards](#get-started) easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options.
* Explore and contextualize data with [advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions](#key-visual-tools) to monitor what your systems are doing in real time.
* Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics.
* [Send data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) to New Relic and your dashboards from any source. 

## Get started with dashboards [#get-started]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** and click on **Dashboards**.

In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and [data apps](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/data-apps-build-collections-linked-dashboards) associated with your New Relic account.

<img
  title="Dashboards_index.png"
  alt="Dashboards_index.png"
  src={dashboardsDashboardIndex}
/>

For each dashboard, the index displays the following information:

* [Favorite status](#dashboards-favorite), indicated by a star
* Name: The name of the dashboard
* Account: The account the dashboard belongs to
* Created by: The user who created the dashboard
* Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified
* Created on: When the dashboard was created

Here you can carry out the following actions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-create"
    title="Create a dashboard"
  >
Create a dashboard from the dashboards index by selecting the **+ Create a dashboard** button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index.

1. Name your dashboard. [Names are searchable](#dashboards-search), so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily.
2. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because **this action cannot be modified**.
3. Press **Create** to continue, or **Cancel** to return to the index.

<Callout variant="tip">
  By default a dashboard is created with [**Edit - everyone in account**](#dashboards-permissions) permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard.
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard:

* [By **duplicating**](#dashboards-clone) an existing dashboard.
* From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard.
* From **[metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer)** or the [**query builder**](/docs/introduction-chart-builder): Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard.
* From the [**explorer**](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer): Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards.

To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see [Add pages to a dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#add-pages-edit).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-import"
    title="Import a dashboard"
  >
    You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the **Import a dashboard** button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index:

    * Paste the JSON code.
    * By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it.
    * By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different [rights](#dashboards-permissions) if you want to change them.

      <Callout variant="tip">
        See how to [obtain a dashboard’s JSON](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard#dash-json).
      </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-clone"
    title="Duplicate a dashboard"
  >
    Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the **Duplicate dashboard** button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your [permission levels](#dashboards-permissions).

    The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen.

    The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word "copy". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named `this is my dashboard`, the duplicate will be created as `this is my dashboard copy`. The duplicate has **Edit - everyone in account** permissions.

    You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      The index displays dashboards according to [sorting](/docs/dashboards/explore-dashboards-index/explore-dashboards-index#sort-dashboards). To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-delete"
    title="Delete a dashboard"
  >
    To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the **Delete** button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has **Edit - everyone in account** permissions. For more information, [see the permissions information](#dashboards-permissions).

    You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-favorite"
    title="Mark a dashboard as favorite"
  >
    Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic home page.

    To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-search"
    title="Search and sort dashboards"
  >
    You can **search** dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index.

    You can also **sort** the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the [favorited and non-favorited sections](#dashboards-favorite). To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Dashboard permissions [#dashboards-permissions]

Dashboards have three types of permissions:

* **Edit - everyone in account**: All users have full rights to the dashboard.
* **Read-only - everyone in account**: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it.
* **Private**: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden.

When you [create a dashboard](/docs/dashboards/explore-dashboards-index/explore-dashboards-index#create-dashboard) using the **Create a dashboard** button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have **Edit - everyone in account** rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting.

## Create and manage dashboards via API [#nerdgraph]

You can use [our NerdGraph API to create and manage dashboards](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-dashboards). Our API gives you access to more features than the UI: for example, you can create dashboards with data from multiple accounts. 

You can also [add tags with NerdGraph](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor#manage). You can filter your dashboards using tags, which can be helpful to identify users, accounts, locations, and more. 

## Key visual tools

Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-coloring"
    title="Consistent chart coloring"
  >
    So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-needle"
    title="Correlated needle"
  >
    When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-scrubber"
    title="Data scrubber"
  >
    The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other.

    Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-zoom"
    title="Brush to zoom"
  >
    Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard.

    The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-zoom"
    title="Custom visualizations"
  >
    You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see [Build a custom visualization for dashboards](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/build-visualization) and [Add custom visualizations to your dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/add-custom-visualizations-your-dashboards).
