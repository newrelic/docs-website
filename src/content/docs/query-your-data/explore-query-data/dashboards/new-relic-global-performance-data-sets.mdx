## Access valuable data and try out New Relic [#why-matters]

Our first Global Performance data set, [Public API Performance](/docs/query-your-data/new-relic-one-dashboards/global-performance-dataset/enable-public-api-performance-dashboard), offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized).

Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process.

There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs.

## Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard [#enable]

To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data.

Both new and existing customers should be able to view Global Performance data in the Public API Performance dashboard quickly and easliy. To start using this dashboard, see [Explore the Public API Performance dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/new-relic-one-dashboards/global-performance-dataset/enable-public-api-performance-dashboard).
