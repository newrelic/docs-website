The NRQL console is a quick way to query your data anywhere in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** while keeping context of what you're doing. Whether you're monitoring your services, troubleshooting an issue, or just browsing your platform, with the NRQL console you can explore your data to understand more about what you are seeing in just a click, without leaving your current view. Be faster at querying your data!

To enable or disable the NRQL console, go to the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and look for the NRQL console toggle.
