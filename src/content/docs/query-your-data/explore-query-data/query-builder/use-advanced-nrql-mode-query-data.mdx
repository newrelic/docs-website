The [query builder](https://one.newrelic.com/data-exploration/query-builder) has two modes: NRQL mode and PromQL-style mode. 

You can learn about how to form NRQL queries in the [NRQL docs](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql). The following table gives some additional tips for using the query builder in NRQL mode.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Item
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Prompts
      </td>

      <td>
        For each statement or function in your query, you can view a list of valid options, with tooltips.

        />

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Events
      </td>

      <td>
        You can use multiple event types in an NRQL query.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        You can use multiple attributes per event type in an NRQL query.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View previous queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Once you run an NRQL query, use the **My recent queries** dropdown to view up the last 1,000 queries that you ran. The dropdown has a search box to help you find your query.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Autocompleter
      </td>

      <td>
        The query builder's autocompleter will display events and attributes reported within the last 60 minutes. An example of this is a process that runs once a day, such as a standard system health check that kicks off every morning at 6:00am. If you attempt to query the event at 7:05am, the event and subsequent attributes will not be visible in the autocomplete dropdown.

        These events and attributes are still queryable by typing the exact string.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Multi query
      </td>

      <td>
        When using the [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-timeseries) clause you can run and compare up to 10 queries from different accounts.

        To use multi query, enter your first query with `TIMESERIES` and run it. Once the results are rendered, the **Add another query** button is activated and you can add another query.
