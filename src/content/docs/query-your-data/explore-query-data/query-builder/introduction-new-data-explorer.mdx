You can now explore all your data visually using the <DNT>**query experience data explorer**</DNT> without needing to know how to write [NRQL-format queries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

Need to perform a more detailed search? Read how to [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/). If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account to start monitoring your data today.


## Importance of data explorer [#importance-of-data-explorer]

Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to alert events, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries.

With the <DNT>**data explorer**</DNT>, you can access all data stored in the New Relic database (NRDB) in a quick, intuitive way. You can then select facet your queries using attributes and filter down to the needed value.

Other things the data explorer view helps you do:

* View data from different perspectives: from raw data to various visualizations that give insights on evolution, distribution, and more.
* Drill down into data using filters.
* View a prediction based on the trend of your data (available with the public preview of [NRQL Predictions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/nrql-predictions)).
* Add your searches to a dashboard.
* Understand how NRQL works: the Data Explorer automatically generates the NRQL queries based on your selections.

### Types of data you can explore [#types-of-data]

Following are the types of data you can explore using the <DNT>**Data Explorer**</DNT> view:

* [Dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) (the Metric data type).
* [Events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#events-new-relic) (the Event data type).
* [Logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui) (the Log data type).
* [Timeslices](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslices) (<InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents, mobile agents, and the <InlinePopover type="browser"/> agent report this data type. To explore this type of data, you must choose an entity monitored by one of those agents, and then you'll see those options.).
* [Lookups](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#lookups) (the Lookup data type).

## Explore your data [#explore-your-data]
