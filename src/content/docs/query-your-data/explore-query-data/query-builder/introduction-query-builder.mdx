import queriesNrqlQueryBuilder from 'images/queries-nrql_screenshot-full_query-builder.png'

With [the query builder](https://one.newrelic.com/data-exploration/query-builder), you can run queries of your data to create custom charts and other visualizations. You can also build custom [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard#dash-create-chart) containing multiple charts.

## Why it matters

Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities.

Use the query builder to:

* Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services.
* Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system.
* Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks.
* Create NRQL alerts from the queries you build and run.

Before using the query builder, we recommend reading:

* [Introduction to querying](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) 
* [How to explore your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-data-explorer)

Also note that [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial) gives you access to more powerful querying features. For example, you can run queries across multiple accounts, run asynchronous queries, and more. 

To find the query builder, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Query builder**.

## Use the query builder [#specify-data]

The query builder has two modes:

* NRQL mode, which lets you write queries with the New Relic query language. To learn about how to use that mode, see [NRQL query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data).
* PromQL-style mode, which lets you write queries in the Prometheus query language. To learn about using that mode, see [PromQL-style query builder](#chart-builder-promql).

To browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries, you can use the [Metrics and events explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer). 

## Use and share charts [#customize-chart]

Once you have built a chart you can:

* [Change the type of chart](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/use-charts/use-your-charts#change-appearance). Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other [available chart types](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-types) to present your data in the visual format that you want to use.
* [Share your chart](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/use-charts/use-your-charts#share-charts).
* [Add your chart to a dashboard](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/use-charts/use-your-charts#add-to-dashboard).
* [Create a NRQL alert condition from your chart](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create-chart).
