High quality code and high quality releases are crucial for an organization to innovate and grow. Poor quality code diverts engineering time that could use to innovate, instead wasting it on troubleshooting and fixing. High quality releases will help keep a steady userbase by keeping customers happy. Poor quality releases and poor quality code both have a strong negative impact on customer satisfaction and revenue.

This tutorial helps you identify specific key performance indicators and processes that drive stability through code and release quality improvement. It focuses on improving the quality of your development first, then improving the quality of your releases.
