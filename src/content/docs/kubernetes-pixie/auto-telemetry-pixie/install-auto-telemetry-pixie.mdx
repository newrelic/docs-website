To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, start with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=797d48ab-b066-d3da-f4d5-652bb92e5ce9). The guided install deploys the New Relic integration with Pixie on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie.

If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster.

## General prerequisites for using Pixie [#general-prereqs]

Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever!

Tips before getting started:

* Review this [Pixie data security overview](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/pixie-data-security-overview) for actions to take to secure your data.
* Make sure your clusters have sufficient memory. Pixie requires, at minimum, 1Gib of memory on each node in your cluster. Review this [Pixie memory management overview](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/manage-pixie-memory) for actions to take to tune memory usage.
* Make sure Pixie runs in privileged mode.
* Review the other [Pixie technical requirements](https://docs.px.dev/installing-pixie/requirements/).

## Setup steps depend on your account status [#general-setup]

Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both.

        If you already have both types of accounts and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the [Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file](#install-helm-command-manifest) section of the guided install. Then, follow the steps.

        If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account.

Then, [continue the guided install process](#install-helm-command-manifest).

## Install from the beginning of the guided install process [#install-beginning]

1. Open our [New Relic monitoring guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09LdWJlcm5ldGVzIiwiYWN0aXZlRW52aXJvbm1lbnQiOiJrdWJlcm5ldGVzIiwicGF0aCI6bnVsbCwiZW52Ijoia3ViZXJuZXRlcyJ9).
2. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click **Continue**.
   Note: if you've a single account, you won't see this option.
3. Select **Kubernetes** and then continue with step one in the next section.

## Install from the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file [#install-helm-command-manifest]

If you arrived in the guided install process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here.

1. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace.

   <Callout variant="important">
     Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes. (Exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run.) Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers.
   </Callout>

2. Click **Continue**.

3. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click **Continue**.

4. On the **Choose install method** page, select either **Helm** or **manifest**.

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       className="freq-link"
       id="helm-method"
       title="Helm method"
     >
       Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out our [strategies for reducing ingest](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/manage-pixie-data).

       Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run `kubectl get pods -n newrelic`.

       For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see our documentation about [Helm installation requirements](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#h2-compatibility-and-requirements).
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       className="freq-link"
       id="manifest-method"
       title="manifest method"
     >
       Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the [Kubernetes docs](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#cloud-platforms).
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>

5. Click **Continue** to open the **Listening for data** page.

6. When you get the message, **See your data**, click **Kubernetes Cluster Explorer** to see your cluster.

   Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature.

## If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account [#link-wrong-accounts]

Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account.

## Upgrade the Pixie integration [#upgrade]

To determine your Pixie integration version, see our [Pixie troubleshooting documentation](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/troubleshooting/get-pixie-integration-version).

The Pixie integration is installed as part of New Relic's Kubernetes integration. To upgrade the Kubernetes integration, see our [Kubernetes installation documentation](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure#update).

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
  After August 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including version 1 of our integration with Pixie. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/july-2022-end-of-life-announcements/188318).
</Callout>

## Uninstall the Pixie integration [#uninstall]

The Pixie integration is installed as part of the Kubernetes integration of New Relic. To uninstall the Kubernetes integration, see our [Uninstall Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes).
