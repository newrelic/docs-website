Use the Pixie [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) to see golden metrics and a sample of individual full-body requests sent to a specific service using a specific protocol. Pixie entities are powered by data that has been automatically traced by Pixie. Select a protocol below to learn more:

* [DNS](#dns)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgres)
* [Redis](#redis)
* [Kafka](#kafka)
* [AMQP](#amqp)

You can find the Pixie entities under the <DoNotTranslate>**Other entities**</DoNotTranslate> section of the <DoNotTranslate>**All entities**</DoNotTranslate> page:

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are missing any of these Pixie entities, check your [Customize Pixie Ingest](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/overview/#pixie-configure-storage) configuration. You may have disabled ingest for a certain protocol.

## DNS [#dns]

Select a service from the <DoNotTranslate>**DNS - Pixie**</DoNotTranslate> entity list to see time series graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all DNS requests sent to that service. Inspect the Sampled DNS Requests table to see full-body DNS requests and responses received by this service.

DNS requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:
* Quickly determine which services are making DNS requests.
* Get high-level DNS response time and throughput information.
* Observe imbalances of throughput between DNS servers.

## MySQL [#mysql]

Select a service from the <DoNotTranslate>**MySQL - Pixie**</DoNotTranslate> entity list to see time series graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all MySQL requests sent to that service. Inspect the "Sampled MySQL Requests" table to see full-body MySQL requests and responses received by this service.

MySQL requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per MySQL command.
* Inspect the body of slow MySQL commands.

Inspect the "Sampled Postgres Requests" table to see full-body PostgreSQL requests and responses received by this service.

PostgreSQL requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per PostgreSQL command.
* Inspect the body of slow PostgreSQL commands.
