Use the Pixie [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) to see golden metrics and a sample of individual full-body requests sent to a specific service using a specific protocol. Pixie entities are powered by data that has been automatically traced by Pixie. Select a protocol below to learn more:

* [DNS](#dns)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgres)
* [Redis](#redis)
* [Kafka](#kafka)
* [AMQP](#amqp)

You can find the Pixie entities under the **Other entities** section of the **All entities** page:

  If you are missing any of these Pixie entities, check your [Customize Pixie Ingest](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/overview/#pixie-configure-storage) configuration. You may have disabled ingest for a certain protocol.

## DNS [#dns]

Select a service from the **DNS - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all DNS requests sent to that service. Inspect the Sampled DNS Requests table to see full-body DNS requests and responses received by this service.

DNS requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:
* Quickly determine which services are making DNS requests.
* Get high-level DNS response time and throughput information.
* Observe imbalances of throughput between DNS servers.

## MySQL [#mysql]

Select a service from the **MySQL - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all MySQL requests sent to that service. Inspect the "Sampled MySQL Requests" table to see full-body MySQL requests and responses received by this service.

MySQL requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per MySQL command.
* Inspect the body of slow MySQL commands.

Select a service from the **Postgres - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all PostgreSQL requests sent to that service. Inspect the "Sampled Postgres Requests" table to see full-body PostgreSQL requests and responses received by this service.

PostgreSQL requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per PostgreSQL command.
* Inspect the body of slow PostgreSQL commands.

## Redis [#redis]

Select a service from the **Redis - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all Redis requests sent to a service. Inspect the "Sampled Redis Requests" table to see full-body Redis requests and responses received by this service.

Redis requests automatically traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per Redis command.
* Inspect the body of slow Redis commands.

## Kafka [#kafka]

Select a service from the **Kafka - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all Kafka messages sent to that service. Inspect the "Sample of Kafka Requests" table to see full-body Kafka messages received by this service.

Kafka messages traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service.
* See response time per Kafka command.
* Inspect the body of slow Kafka messages.

## AMQP [#amqp]

Select a service from the **AMQP - Pixie** entity list to see timeseries graphs of response time, error rate and throughput for all AMQP messages sent to that service.

AMQP messages traced by Pixie can be used to:

* See response time, error rate and throughput per service and pod.
* See a list of AMQP consumers and producers.
* See response time per AMQP method.
* Inspect the body of traced AMQP messages.
