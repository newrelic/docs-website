Auto-telemetry collected by Pixie can be found throughout New Relic's UI. Use Pixie telemetry data to do the following:

* [Monitor service health](#service-health)
* [See pod application CPU profiles](#cpu-profiles)
* [Monitor networking issues](#network-health)
* [Inspect full-body requests](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/pixie-entities)

The UI of New Relic pulls Pixie telemetry data from both short-term and long-term storage. Find out more about the hybrid storage model for the New Relic Pixie integration [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/overview).

## Monitor service health  [#service-health]

Pixie automatically traces HTTP (including HTTP/2) requests sent between services, even if one endpoint is outside of the cluster.

The New Relic Pixie integration exports HTTP spans from Pixie to New Relic for long-term storage using the OpenTelemetry protocol. The **Services - OpenTelemetry** view lists the services automatically identified by Pixie, along with a high-level overview of service response time, throughput and error rate.

<figcaption>

Selecting a service from this list will open the service **Summary** view which shows graphs of the response time, throughput and error rate for all HTTP requests made to this service.

<img

From the OpenTelemetry service view, select the **Service map** tab in the left sidebar. This service map view helps visualize your application's dependencies by showing a graph of all the entities that the service communicates with.

The OpenTelemetry service **Transactions** tab shows the different endpoints that the service makes requests to. You can sort the endpoints by response time or throughput.

The **Databases** tab shows any database requests the service makes.

Service health information powered by Pixie can also be found from the Kubernetes cluster explorer (KCE) views. The KCE summary view includes all services automatically identified by Pixie.

<img
  title="The Kubernetes cluster explorer shows the services identified by Pixie."
  alt="The Kubernetes cluster explorer shows the services identified by Pixie."

Selecting a service shows the service details sidebar with HTTP throughput, error rate and response time data collected by Pixie:

<figcaption>

At the bottom of the service details view, select the **Map View** button in the **Related Entities** section.

This map view helps visualize your application's dependencies by showing a graph of all the entities that the service communicates with.

<img

At the top of the service details view, select **Check metrics in Pixie** to be taken to the `px/service` script in the [Live Debugging with Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/live-debugging-with-pixie) tab. The `px/service script` shows a high-level overview of this service performance statistics as well as inbound requests using the short-term Pixie data stored on your cluster.

## See pod application CPU profiles  [#cpu-profiles]

You can use Pixie's continuous profiling feature to investigate spikes in CPU utilization or to identify performance issues within your application code.

Select a pod listed in the Kubernetes cluster explorer view to see the pod details view.

<img

From the pod details view, select the **Check flamegraph in Pixie** option to see a CPU profile using the rich set of data Pixie stores in short-term storage on your cluster.

<img

<figcaption>
  Use Pixie to see CPU flamegraphs for your Kubernetes pods.
</figcaption>

To see a CPU flamegraph for a Kubernetes node, use the `px/node` script in the [Live debugging with Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/live-debugging-with-pixie) tab. Scroll to the bottom of this view to see the CPU flamegraph for the node.

Learn how to interact with Pixie's CPU flamegraphs in the [Continuous Profiling Tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/profiler/).

## Monitor networking issues  [#network-health]

You can use Pixie to monitor your Kubernetes network alongside your application and infrastructure layers.

The **Summary** tab of the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains a **Kubernetes network monitoring with Pixie** section. Each view linked in this section is powered by the rich set of Pixie telemetry data [stored in short-term storage](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/overview) on your cluster.

The **Spot DNS issues** link will show you a graph of all the DNS requests in your cluster. Hover over any edge on the graph to see latency and throughput information.

The **See TCP retransmissions** and **See dropped packets** links will show graphs of the TCP retransmits and TCP drops in your cluster. Note that you'll need to press the `RUN` button to see results for these views. The TCP drops output is shown below:

<img

Note that the above **Kubernetes network monitoring with Pixie** views can also be seen in the [Live debugging with Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/live-debugging-with-pixie) tab using the `px/dns_flow_graph`, `px/tcp_drops` and `px/tcp_retransmits` scripts. These scripts have optional arguments that allow you to filter the output to select entities.
