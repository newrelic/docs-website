Use the **Live debugging with Pixie** tab to query the full set of telemetry data that Pixie collects in short-term storage on your cluster.

Find out more about the hybrid storage model for the New Relic Pixie integration [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/overview).

The **Live debugging with Pixie** tab contains an embedded view of the Pixie UI. Views in Pixie are powered by PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to query and visualize the telemetry data captured by eBPF.

Pixie provides many [open source PxL scripts](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/tree/main/src/pxl_scripts) which enable you to debug:

* Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis, Kafka. Learn more: [Request tracing tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/request-tracing/).
* Database request performance. Learn more: [Database query profiling tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/database-query-profiling/).
* Service maps to learn which services are talking to each other. Learn more: [Service performance tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/service-performance/).
* Network traffic maps to learn which nodes are talking to each other. Learn more: [Network monitoring tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/network-monitoring/).
* Resource usage by Node and Pod. Learn more: [Infra health tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/infra-health/).
* Spikes in CPU utilization. Learn more: [Continuous CPU profiling tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/profiler/).

## Run a PxL script  [#run-script]

<Callout variant="important">
  For best results, select `5 minutes` in the time picker when using the **Live Debugging with Pixie** tab. To examine less recent Pixie data, check out the [Explore Pixie data](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/explore-pixie-data) section.
</Callout>

To run a script in the **Live debugging with Pixie** tab:

1. Select a script from the `script` drop-down menu.
2. Fill in any required script arguments. Required arguments are denoted with an `*` next to the argument name.
3. Run the script using the `RUN` button in the top right or by using the keyboard shortcut: `ctrl+enter` (Windows, Linux) or `cmd+enter` (Mac).

## Follow script deep links  [#deep-links]

Views in Pixie contain deep links that allow you to easily navigate between Kubernetes entities.

For example, the **Nodes** table in the `px/cluster` script (pictured above) outputs a list of all of the nodes in your cluster. Click on a node to be taken to the `px/node` script for that particular node. The `px/node` script shows an overview of a particular node’s pods, CPU and memory usage, and network traffic.

## Modify a PxL script  [#modify-script]
