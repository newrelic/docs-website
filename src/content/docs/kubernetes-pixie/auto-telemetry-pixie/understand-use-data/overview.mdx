When you install the New Relic Pixie integration, your auto-telemetry data is stored in two locations. Pixie stores the [full set of telemetry data it collects](#pixie-data-sources) on the nodes in your cluster in short-term storage. The New Relic integration queries Pixie every few minutes and [persists select telemetry data](#pixie-long-term-storage) in New Relic for long-term storage.

This hybrid storage model allows you to debug your active Kubernetes incidents with a rich set of the most recent telemetry data, while only paying to ingest a select and configurable amount of data into long-term storage.

In the New Relic UI, you can interact with the telemetry data in both short-term and long-term storage:

* Query the full set of Pixie telemetry data in short-term storage on your cluster using the [Live Debugging with Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/live-debugging-with-pixie) tab.
* [Explore Pixie data](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/explore-pixie-data) persisted in New Relic using the Kubernetes cluster explorer.
* [Create dashboards of Pixie data](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/dashboard-pixie-data) persisted in New Relic.
* [Query Pixie data](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/understand-use-data/query-pixie-data) persisted in New Relic using the query builder and NerdGraph API

## What data does Pixie collect?  [#pixie-data-sources]

[Pixie uses eBPF](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/pixie-ebpf/) to automatically collect telemetry data such as full-body application requests, resource and network metrics, application CPU profiles and more.

To see the complete list of data sources that Pixie automatically collects, check out Pixie's [reference docs](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/data-sources/).

## How much data does Pixie store? [#pixie-short-term-storage]

The primary focus of the open source Pixie project is to build a real-time debugging platform. Short-term storage on the cluster is limited, so Pixie telemetry data is stored for up to 24 hours (at most) before it is aged out of memory. Since this data is stored in your cluster, you don’t pay for ingesting it.

To learn how to increase or decrease Pixie’s short-term storage, see the [Manage Pixie memory guide]().

## What Pixie data does New Relic persist?  [#pixie-long-term-storage]

The New Relic Pixie integration persists select Pixie telemetry data for long-term storage. The default set of persisted data includes:

* HTTP (including HTTP/2) golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate)
* HTTP (including HTTP/2) request spans
* MySQL and PostgreSQL database request spans
* JVM metrics

You can configure which data is persisted in New Relic, including persisting additional Pixie telemetry data.
