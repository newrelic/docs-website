## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/install-auto-telemetry-pixie) for New Relic's Pixie integration and would like to reduce the amount of memory that Pixie uses.

## Solution

Pixie [uses memory for two different purposes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/advanced-configuration/manage-pixie-memory#memory-usage): collecting telemetry data and short-term in-cluster storage of this data. If you’d like to specify a different amount of memory for short-term storage, you can [configure the short-term storage memory limit](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/advanced-configuration/manage-pixie-memory#reduce-data-storage) during installation.
