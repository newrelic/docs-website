To check the health of a cluster with Pixie installed, run the [diagnostics script](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/k8s-diag-utilities/tree/main/pixie-diag).

This simple bash script runs standard Kubernetes commands in the namespace that Pixie is installed in. The output of this script can be used to do a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support.
