## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/install-auto-telemetry-pixie) for New Relic's Pixie integration but one or more `vizier-pem` pods are frequently being OOMKilled.

## Solution

Part of the benefit of deploying on Kubernetes is that Kubernetes will OOMKill pods that are using too many resources to protect the other pods in the cluster.

When Pixie's `vizier-pem` pods exceed the memory limit, they are OOMKilled. Kubernetes does this to protect the other applications, so it won't cause problems on other pods. For `vizier-pem` pods that are regularly being OOMKilled, try [deploying Pixie with more memory](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/advanced-configuration/manage-pixie-memory#set-memory-limit).
