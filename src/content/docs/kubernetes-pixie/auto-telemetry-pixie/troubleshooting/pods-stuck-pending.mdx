metaDescription: "For New Relic's Pixie integration: troubleshooting vizier-pem pods stuck in pending state."

## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/install-auto-telemetry-pixie) for New Relic's Pixie integration but one or more `vizier-pem` pods are stuck in the pending state.

## Solution

When the `vizier-pem` pods fail to schedule, this is usually because there are nodes that don't have the requested amount of memory.

Try [reducing the memory request](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/advanced-configuration/manage-pixie-memory#set-memory-request) down as far as `1Gi`. For particularly large or high traffic clusters, `1Gi` may not be enough and some `vizier-pem` OOMKills might occur. For these clusters, you can set a higher limit than request, such as `2Gi` for the limit.
