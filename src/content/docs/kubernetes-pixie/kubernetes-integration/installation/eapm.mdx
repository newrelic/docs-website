The New Relic extended Application Performance Monitoring (eAPM) agent is an integration of the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology into New Relic's platform. The eAPM agent offers a new method for monitoring Kubernetes services, allowing customers to monitor their services without the need for language-specific agents. The eAPM agent collects data directly from the kernel, providing valuable insights into the performance of services running on the Kubernetes cluster.

The New Relic eAPM agent is installed on each node of the Kubernetes cluster. After installation, the eAPM agent:

* Detects all services running on the Kubernetes cluster.
* Collect the necessary data from the kernel.
* Send the data to the New Relic platform.

You can view the eAPM instrumentation data in the APM UI to provide performance insights for the services running on the Kubernetes cluster.

This data is populate in the APM UI to provide the performance insights for the services running on the Kubernetes cluster.

## Key features [#key-features]

Features of the eAPM integration include:

* **Zero-code instrumentation:** Simplifies the monitoring process by eliminating the need for manual code instrumentation, reducing deployment complexity, and maintenance overhead.
* **Comprehensive observability:** Enables detailed visibility into application and network performance, helping to quickly identify and resolve issues.
* **Low-resource overhead:** Operates efficiently with minimal impact on system resources, leveraging its position within the kernel.

## Access the eAPM-powered APM UI [#eapm-access]

To access the eAPM-powered APM UI:

1. Go to [https://one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > **APM & Services**.
2. In the search banner, set the search criteria as `instrumentation.name = nr_ebpf`:
    <img
    title="eBPF Search"
    alt="A screenshot showing the eBPF search bar"
    src="/images/ebpf_filters.webp"
    />
    After the search is completed, a list of entities is displayed. The entity name for each service matches the service name in the Kubernetes cluster.


### Find and use data [#ui-screen]

The eAPM agent generates data to power the New Relic APM experience, eliminating the need for additional custom instrumentation in your codebase.


## How eAPM agent and APM works together [#eapm-apm]

eAPM and New Relic APM agents are designed to complement one another. For example, a customer can begin by deploying the eAPM agent on their cluster using the guided or manual installation process. This agent automatically detects and reports all services within the cluster, providing a streamlined approach without the need to select a specific language agent. All services are reported collectively and promptly.

Following the initial deployment, customers can evaluate the auto-discovered services and decide which ones require the comprehensive monitoring features of the full APM solution, including distributed tracing.

When a service is upgraded to full APM monitoring, the eAPM agent stops collecting telemetry data for that service to avoid duplicate charges. Additionally, please note that the service will now be represented as a new entity, distinct from the one previously reported by eBPF, which will no longer receive data.


## Pricing information

Your use of the New Relic eAPM agent is billable during preview in accordance with your Order. The costs associated with this feature are determined by the following factors, as applicable to the pricing model associated with your account:

* **Data Ingest:** Charges may be based on the volume of data ingested, measured in GB ingested. This includes all data collected by the eAPM agent and transmitted to the New Relic platform.
* **APM UI Usage:** Charges may be incurred based on the utilization of the APM User Interface, measured in Compute Capacity Units (CCU) for the Core Compute Product.

For further details on pricing, please contact our sales team or refer to your Order.


<Callout variant="tip" title="TIP">

New Relic does not recommend installing both eAPM and Pixie on the same cluster. Since they both use eBPF, running these tools simultaneously may lead to excessive resource consumption and potentially degrade your cluster's performance.
