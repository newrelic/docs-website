After a new version of Kubernetes has been released, you can upgrade the Kubernetes version running on control plane nodes and worker nodes in a cluster.

## Upgrading our Kubernetes integration [#update]

Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience.

### Upgrading using the guided install and Helm [#update-helm]

In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=51fbbd48-c8ca-ead9-bb90-af96e18d82a7), just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version.

### Upgrading using the guided install and plain manifests [#update-manifests]

<Callout variant="tip">
  We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly.
</Callout>

If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, you will need to first remove the old installation using `kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml`, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using `kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml`.

We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster.
