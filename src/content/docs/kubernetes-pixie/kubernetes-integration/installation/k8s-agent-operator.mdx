<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The Kubernetes agent operator streamlines full-stack observability for Kubernetes environments by automating APM instrumentation alongside Kubernetes agent deployment. By enabling APM auto instrumentation, developers no longer need to manually manage [APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/). The Kubernetes agent operator will automatically install, upgrade and remove APM agents.

It currently [supports](#k8s-supported-versions) Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby with additional languages (PHP and Go) on the way.
It has been tested on EKS and on-premise clusters running AMD nodes.

## Before you begin [#before-begin]

Before installing the operator, check the following:

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/): You must install it to use the charts. See the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) if you need help getting started.

* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): You have to configure it to communicate with your cluster.

* [Certificate manager](https://cert-manager.io/): You have to install it in the cluster.

### Installation of the `cert-manager` dependency [#install-cert-manager]

To install the certificate manager dependency, run these commands:

```shell
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --create-namespace \
    --set crds.enabled=true
```

## Installation of the Kubernetes agent operator [#install-k8s-operator]

Depending on what you need, you can choose to install the agent operator independently or together with our K8s integrations.

We strongly recommend to install it together with the Kubernetes integration to take advantage of our entire [full stack observability](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) experience.

### Bundle installation in addition to the Kubernetes integration (recommended) [#bundle-installation]

The Kubernetes agent operator chart is integrated as part of the [nri-bundle](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart, which manages the installation of all the components needed to enable a full Kubernetes observability.

Add the `k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true` parameter to your helm command or include it in a [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/nri-bundle/values.yaml) file.

See the [Install the Kubernetes integration](/install/kubernetes/?dropdown1=helm) page for more information about using Helm or check out the [nri-bundle](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart.

See this sample of Helm command using parameters:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com

helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
    --set global.licenseKey=<NEW RELIC INGEST LICENSE KEY> \
    --set global.cluster=<CLUSTER_NAME> \
    --namespace=newrelic \
    --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \
    --set global.lowDataMode=true \
    --set kube-state-metrics.enabled=true \
    --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \
    --set k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true \
    --create-namespace
```

### Standalone installation [#standalone-installation]

To install the Kubernetes agent operator with the default configuration, run these commands:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic-k8s https://newrelic.github.io/k8s-agents-operator
helm upgrade --install k8s-agents-operator newrelic-k8s/k8s-agents-operator \
    --namespace newrelic \
    --create-namespace \
    --set licenseKey=<YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY>
```

For a complete list of configuration options, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-agents-operator/tree/main/charts/k8s-agents-operator#values) chart.

## Configuring a namespace to enable the operator [#configuring-namespace]

Each namespace requires a two-step process to enable automatic instrumentation of applications deployed within it.

1. Create a secret containing a valid [New Relic ingest license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for each namespace you want the operator to instrument.

   ```shell
       kubectl create secret generic newrelic-key-secret \
           --namespace <NAMESPACE_TO_MONITOR> \
           --from-literal=new_relic_license_key=<YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY>
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<YOUR_NEW_RELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY>` with your valid New Relic license key.

2. Apply the following CRD to each namespace you want to auto instrument. Run this command:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f <YOUR_YAML_FILE> -n <NAMESPACE_TO_MONITOR>
   ```

   YAML file to apply:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: newrelic.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Instrumentation
   metadata:
       labels:
           app.kubernetes.io/name: instrumentation
           app.kubernetes.io/created-by: k8s-agents-operator
       name: newrelic-instrumentation
   spec:
       java:
           image: newrelic/newrelic-java-init:latest
           # env:
           # Example New Relic agent supported environment variables
           # - name: NEW_RELIC_LABELS
           #   value: "environment:auto-injection"
           # Example overriding the appName configuration
           # - name: NEW_RELIC_POD_NAME
           #   valueFrom:
           #     fieldRef:
           #       fieldPath: metadata.name
           # - name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME
           #   value: "$(NEW_RELIC_LABELS)-$(NEW_RELIC_POD_NAME)"
       nodejs:
           image: newrelic/newrelic-node-init:latest
       python:
           image: newrelic/newrelic-python-init:latest
       dotnet:
           image: newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-init:latest
       ruby:
           image: newrelic/newrelic-ruby-init:latest
   ```

## Enable automatic APM instrumentation in applications [#enable-apm-instrumentation]

The Kubernetes agent operator looks for language-specific annotations when scheduling your pods to know which applications to monitor.

See the currently supported annotations:

```shell
instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-java: "true"
instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-nodejs: "true"
instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-python: "true"
instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-dotnet: "true"
instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-ruby: "true"
```

See this example of deployment with annotation to instrument the Java agent:

```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
        name: spring-petclinic
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: spring-petclinic
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: spring-petclinic
          annotations:
            instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-java: "true"
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: spring-petclinic
              image: ghcr.io/pavolloffay/spring-petclinic:latest
              ports:
                - containerPort: 8080
              env:
              - name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME
                value: spring-petclinic-demo
```

## Upgrade APM instrumentation in applications [#upgrade-apm-instrumention]

By default, the Kubernetes agent operator automatically installs the latest available versions of the corresponding [APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/).

Once an application is monitored, it's not automatically upgraded to a newer version unless the user chooses to upgrade. You can seamlessly upgrade the application to a newer version by simply redeploying the pods or restarting your deployment.

## Remove APM instrumentation in applications [#remove-apm-instrumentation]

To remove the APM instrumentation in an application, you must remove the annotations used by the Kubernetes agent operator. In a few seconds, you will see that the APM agents have been automatically removed.

## Updating the Kubernetes agent operator [#upgrading-k8s-operator]

### Bundle installation

Run a upgrade of the nri-bundle chart with the following parameter:

```shell
 k8s-agents-operator.enabled=true
```

### Standalone installation

Run the `helm upgrade` command to update to a newer version of the Kubernetes agent operator.

```shell
    helm upgrade k8s-agents-operator newrelic/k8s-agents-operator -n newrelic
```

## Uninstalling the Kubernetes agent operator [#uninstall-k8s-operator]

### Bundle installation

Uninstall the nri-bundle chart or if you only want to remove the operator, run a helm upgrade with the following parameter:

```shell
 k8s-agents-operator.enabled=false
```

### Standalone installation

To uninstall and delete the Kubernetes agent operator, run this command:

```shell
    helm uninstall k8s-agents-operator -n newrelic
```

## Find and use data [#find-data]

* Get insights of your applications and resolve incidents using the [APM summary](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/triage-run-diagnostics/) page.

* Check out the [Kubernetes summary](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) page. It provides Kubernetes insights in the context of your monitored applications.

## Frequently Asked Questions [#faq]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="route-apps-telemetry"
    title="Can I route my applications telemetry to different accounts?"
  >
    Yes, you just need to change your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) injected in the secret in the appropriate namespace.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The [K8s APM experience](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/) is only available on the account where the data from the applications and the K8s cluster is available.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="setup-operator"
    title="Can I setup the operator to inject an specific version of an APM agent?"
  >
    During preview, we only support the latest version of each [APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/). After GA, we will allow users to change the version of APM agents.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="modify-conf-apm"
    title="Can I install the K8s agent operator if my applications are already instrumented?"
  >
    Installing two APM agents in the same application can potentially lead to unexpected issues. Therefore, we strongly recommend removing any existing instrumentation before installing the operator.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

If your applications are not instrumented, you should check the following:

* Please be sure to redeploy or deploy new applications after the operator has been installed. Please be advised that the operator only auto-instruments new applications deployed in the cluster.

* Check that the secret and the instrumentation CRD are installed in the app's namespace.

  ```shell
  kubectl get secrets -n <NAMESPACE>
  kubectl get instrumentation -n <NAMESPACE>
  ```

* Check that the pod has the annotations that enable automatic instrumentation.

  ```shell
      kubectl get pod <POD> -n <NAMESPACE>  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'
  ```

* Get logs from the agent operator pod.

  ```shell
      kubectl logs <AGENT_OPERATOR_POD> -n newrelic
  ```

* Ensure the `init` container has been injected and sucessfully executed inside the application's pod.

  ```shell
      kubectl describe pod <POD> -n <NAMESPACE>
  ```

## Support [#support]

The Kubernetes agent operator currently supports the latest version of these  APM agents: Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

Once the operator is on general availability, the most recent 3 versions of each of the APM agents will be supported.
