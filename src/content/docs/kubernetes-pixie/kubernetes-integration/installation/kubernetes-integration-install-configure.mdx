The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects telemetry data from your cluster using several New Relic integrations such as the [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), the [Prometheus Agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/), and the [New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs).

## Why use the guided install? [#why-guided-install]
To install our Kubernetes integration, we recommend that you follow the instructions here for our guided install. We recommend this interactive installation tool for servers, VMs, and [unprivileged](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes) environments. Here are some advantages of using the guided install:

* It can provide either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm.
* It gives you control over which features are enabled and which data is collected.
* It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For some environments, you may need (or prefer) to do a manual install instead of the guided install. We have docs for the following: [Manual install with Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/), [Windows](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-version2-kubernetes-integration-windows/), and [EKS Fargate](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/install-fargate-integration/).

    2. Complete the steps in our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=51fbbd48-c8ca-ead9-bb90-af96e18d82a7).
    3. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the `DaemonSet` portion of your manifest. Set the `.pem` file:
      ```yaml
      env:
        - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR
          value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR
        - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE
          value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME
      ```
    4. Set your YAML key path to `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env`.
    5. Save your changes.

## Before you start the guided install [#before-start]

Take a look at the following to make sure you're ready:

* If you're installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these [preliminary notes](#cloud-platforms) before proceeding.
* If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, you will need to first remove the old installation using `kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml`, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using `kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml`.
* Make sure you're using the supported Kubernetes versions and make sure to check out the preliminary notes for your managed services or platforms on our [compatibility and requirements page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements).
* Make sure you have New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. You can set up an account that's free&mdash;no credit card required.
* Make sure the newrelic dockerhub (`https://hub.docker.com/u/newrelic`) and Google's registry (`registry.k8s.io`) domains are added to your allow list. This is where the installation will pull container images from. Note, you may need to follow the [commands](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/#how-can-i-check-if-i-am-impacted) to identify the additional Google registry domains to be added to your white list, because `registry.k8s.io` is typically redirected to your local registry domain (e.g., `asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev`) based on your region.

## Start the guided install [#how-to-start]

  <Step>
    On the page **Select the additional data you want to gather**, choose the options that are right for you:

    ### Scrape Prometheus endpoints [#scrape-endpoints]

    By selecting this option, we will install Prometheus in agent mode to collect metrics from the Prometheus endpoints exposed in your cluster. Expand the collapsers to see details about each option:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="scrape-all-except-ksm"
        title="Scrape all Prometheus endpoints except core Kubernetes system metrics (recommended)"
      >
        We recommend this configuration because various other components of the Kubernetes integration, such as [`kube-state-metrics`, `newrelic-infrastructure`, and `nri-prometheus`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle#bundled-charts) will already collect these metrics and configuring Prometheus to exclude those metrics will save your data ingest costs by removing any metric redundancies.

        This configuration will filter out any metrics prefixed with [`kube_`, `container_`, `machine_`, and `cadvisor_`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/64af9453f4b20d4aab88a4d1afda55cf9a6e63c4/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/static/lowdatamodedefaults.yaml).

        Here's an example from `newrelic-prometheus-configurator/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/static/lowdatamodedefaults.yaml`:

        ```yaml
        low_data_mode:
        - action: drop
          source_labels: [__name__]
          regex: "kube_.+|container_.+|machine_.+|cadvisor_.+"
        ```

      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="scrape-all-endpoints"
        title="Scrape all Prometheus endpoints"
      >
        Select **Scrape all Prometheus endpoints** if you prefer to preserve Prometheus' metric naming conventions across all Prometheus metrics regardless of any metric redundancies.
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="scrape-with-quickstarts"
        title="Scrape only Prometheus endpoints with quickstarts"
      >
        New Relic provides [quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/?category=prometheus&search=), which are pre-made dashboards, alerts, and entities for various services. Select this option to have Prometheus only scrape for [services which have a pre-made quickstart](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml#L214-L228) and are ready to go for instant observability.

        Here's an example from `newrelic-prometheus-configurator/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml` showing in the `app_values` field which services will be scraped for the Prometheus quickstart option:

        ```yaml
        kubernetes:
            # NewRelic provides a list of Dashboards, alerts and entities for several Services. The integrations_filter configuration
            # allows to scrape only the targets having this experience out of the box.
            # If integrations_filter is enabled, then the jobs scrape merely the targets having one of the specified labels matching
            # one of the values of app_values.
            # Under the hood, a relabel_configs with 'action=keep' are generated, consider it in case any custom extra_relabel_config is needed.
            integrations_filter:
              # -- enabling the integration filters, merely the targets having one of the specified labels matching
              #    one of the values of app_values are scraped. Each job configuration can override this default.
              enabled: true
              # -- source_labels used to fetch label values in the relabel config added by the integration filters configuration
              source_labels: ["app.kubernetes.io/name", "app.newrelic.io/name", "k8s-app"]
              # -- app_values used to create the regex used in the relabel config added by the integration filters configuration.
              # Note that a single regex will be created from this list, example: '.*(?i)(app1|app2|app3).*'
              app_values: ["redis", "traefik", "calico", "nginx", "coredns", "kube-dns", "etcd", "cockroachdb", "velero", "harbor", "argocd"]
        ```
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="custom-app-labels"
        title="Scrape only the certain labels"
      >
        You'll find this option useful if you're an advanced user who has a good idea of what services you want to see Prometheus metrics from. Enter a comma-separated list of services you want Prometheus to scrape, and Prometheus will perform a wildcard match on the service name in order to find you metrics from your desired endpoint.

        This option will *only* provide metrics from the services that match the submitted list, so be careful to validate the entry for correctness. To learn more about custom app labels, see [Advanced configuration for the Prometheus agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/advanced-configuration/#enable-disable-integrations).

        The services you add to the submitted list will overwrite the data in `app_values` below, and Prometheus will **only** scrape metrics from those services.

        Here is an example from `newrelic-prometheus-configurator/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml`:

        ```yaml
          kubernetes:
            # NewRelic provides a list of Dashboards, alerts and entities for several Services. The integrations_filter configuration
            # allows to scrape only the targets having this experience out of the box.
            # If integrations_filter is enabled, then the jobs scrape merely the targets having one of the specified labels matching
            # one of the values of app_values.
            # Under the hood, a relabel_configs with 'action=keep' are generated, consider it in case any custom extra_relabel_config is needed.
            integrations_filter:
              # -- enabling the integration filters, merely the targets having one of the specified labels matching
              #    one of the values of app_values are scraped. Each job configuration can override this default.
              enabled: true
              # -- source_labels used to fetch label values in the relabel config added by the integration filters configuration
              source_labels: ["app.kubernetes.io/name", "app.newrelic.io/name", "k8s-app"]
              # -- app_values used to create the regex used in the relabel config added by the integration filters configuration.
              # Note that a single regex will be created from this list, example: '.*(?i)(app1|app2|app3).*'
              app_values: ["redis", "traefik", "calico", "nginx", "coredns", "kube-dns", "etcd", "cockroachdb", "velero", "harbor", "argocd"]

        If you want to prioritize data ingest costs, you can choose to gather log data with minimal enrichment, also known as low data mode. This option drops labels and annotations from your logs and only shares standard Kubernetes log data such as the name of the cluster, container, namespace, and pod, along with the message and timestamp.

        When selecting the minimal enrichment mode, only the following log attributes are retained: `cluster_name`, `container_name`, `namespace_name`, `pod_name`, `stream`, `message` and `log`.

        Here's an example of a log with minimal data enrichment:

        ```json
        [
          {
            "cluster_name": "api-test",
            "container_name": "newrelic-logging",
            "namespace_name": "nrlogs",
            "pod_name": "nri-bundle-newrelic-logging-jxnbj",
            "message": "[2021/09/14 12:30:49] [ info] [engine] started (pid=1)\n",
            "stream": "stderr",
            "timestamp": 1631622649138
          }
        ]
        ```

    ### Enable service-level insights, full-body requests, and application profiles through Pixie [#enable-pixie]

    [Pixie](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/what-is-pixie/) is an open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications that uses eBPF to automatically collect telemetry data. If you don't have Pixie installed on your cluster, but want to leverage Pixie's powerful telemetry data collection and visualization on the [New Relic platform](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie/), check **Enable service-level insights, full-body requests, and application profiles through Pixie**.

    If you're already using Community Cloud, select **Community Cloud hosted Pixie is already running on this cluster**. Keep the following in mind about the different ways [Pixie can be hosted](https://docs.px.dev/installing-pixie/install-guides/#title). New Relic provides a different level of integration support for each Pixie hosting option.

        If you're already leveraging Pixie's Community Cloud, you can provide an API key to connect Pixie to New Relic. This approach will embed Pixie's live UI into your New Relic account for easy access (via Pixie's Live Debugging tool), as well as write Pixie data into New Relic through the New Relic OpenTelemetry endpoint.

        title="Self-hosted Pixie"
      >
        If you're using Pixie with a self-hosted Pixie Cloud, you can also connect Pixie to New Relic. This approach will enable the export of Pixie telemetry data into New Relic via the OpenTelemetry endpoint for long-term data retention and visibility. Unfortunately, if you're self-hosting your Pixie Cloud, New Relic does not support embedding Pixie's Live UI.

        If you're self-hosting Pixie Cloud and would like to enable the export of Pixie telemetry data into New Relic, simply enable Pixie in the Kubernetes Integration without checking the **Community Cloud hosted Pixie option**. The Kubernetes Integration will detect that Pixie is running in your cluster and enable the data export for instant data visibility and insight.

  <Step>
    Finalize the Kubernetes installation setup by choosing one of the following installation methods in the last step of the guided install:

    * **Guided Install (recommended)**: This option will automatically download and use the [`newrelic-cli`](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/get-started-new-relic-cli/) CLI to install and configure the Kubernetes integration.
    * **Helm 3**: Use this option if you prefer using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to install and configure the Kubernetes integration. This option installs the [`nri-bundle` Helm chart](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#install-k8-helm), which you can further configure with the options described [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#configure).
    * **Manifest**: Select this option if you prefer generating a Kubernetes manifest in YAML format and manually installing it with [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
