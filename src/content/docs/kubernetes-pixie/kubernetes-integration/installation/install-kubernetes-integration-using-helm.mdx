[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.

<InlineSignup/>

To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our [Kubernetes guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure#guided-install), which will prompt for some configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our guided install also allows installing our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

Make sure [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) is installed on your machine. Version 3 of the Kubernetes Integration requires Helm version 3.

To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and your Kubernetes cluster's name:

1. Find and copy your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
2. Choose a display name for your cluster. For example, you could use the output of:

  ```shell
  kubectl config current-context
  ```

<Callout variant="important">
  Keep these values somewhere safe, as you will need them later during the installation process.

## Install Kubernetes integration with Helm [#install-k8-helm]

New Relic has several Helm charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform:

* [`newrelic-infrastructure`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/tree/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure): Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible for reporting most of the data that is surfaced in the Kubernetes Dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer.
* [`newrelic-logging`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging): Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) output [plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to easily forward your logs to [New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs).
* [`nri-kube-events`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kube-events/tree/main/charts/nri-kube-events): Collects and reports cluster events (such as `kubectl get events`) to New Relic.
* [`prometheus-agent`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/tree/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent): New Relic's Prometheus Configurator configures a [Prometheus in agent mode](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent) and use our remote write endpoint to [reports metrics to New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#remote-write).
* [`nri-metadata-injection`](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-metadata-injection/tree/main/charts/nri-metadata-injection): Sets up a minimal `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` that injects a couple of environment variables in the containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to [correlate APM and infrastructure data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes/).
* [`nri-statsd`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-statsd): New Relic StatsD integration.

Although you can install these components separately, we strongly recommend you use the [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart. New Relic provides this chart, which acts as a wrapper or a meta-package for the individual charts mentioned above. The use of this chart enables you these advantages: 

- It provides full control over which components are installed. Each component is installed as a separate [Helm dependency](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#overriding-values-from-a-parent-chart). You can configure them individually using the parameters mentioned [here](#configure).
- It ensures that their installed versions are compatible with each other.
- It ensures that their configuration values are consistent across the installed charts.

The `nri-bundle` chart is the one that is installed and configured by our [Kubernetes guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure#guided-install).

### Installing and configuring `nri-bundle` with Helm

1. Ensure you're using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and `kubectl`:

  You can check the available contexts with:

  ```shell
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

  And switch to the desired context using:

  ```shell
  kubectl config use-context _CONTEXT_NAME_
  ```

2. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo:

  ```shell
  helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
  ```

3. Create a file named `values-newrelic.yaml`, which will be used to define your configuration:

  ```yaml
  global:
    licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
    cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

  newrelic-prometheus-agent:
    # Automatically scrape prometheus metrics for annotated services in the cluster
    # Collecting prometheus metrics for large clusters might impact data usage significantly
    enabled: true
  nri-metadata-injection:
    # Deploy our webhook to link APM and Kubernetes entities
    enabled: true
  nri-kube-events:
    # Report Kubernetes events
    enabled: true
  newrelic-logging:
    # Report logs for containers running in the cluster
    enabled: true
  kube-state-metrics:
    # Deploy kube-state-metrics in the cluster.
    # Set this to true unless it is already deployed.
    enabled: true
  ```

4. Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we're specifying `--dry-run` and `--debug`, so nothing will be installed in this step:

  ```shell
    helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
--namespace newrelic --create-namespace \
  -f values-newrelic.yaml \
  --dry-run \
  --debug
  ```

  Please notice and adjust the following flags:

    * `global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: Must be set to a valid <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for your account.
    * `global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME`: It's used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account.
    * `kube-state-metrics.enabled=true`: Setting this to `true` will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it's on a different namespace.
    * `newrelic-prometheus-agent.enabled=true`: Will deploy our Prometheus Agent, which automatically collects data from Prometheus endpoints present in the cluster.
    * `nri-metadata-injection.enabled=true`: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows [linking applications instrumented with New Relic APM to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes).


    Our Kubernetes charts have a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to better fit your particular needs. Please, check the [Configure the integration](#configure) section below to see what can be changed.

5. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the command without `--debug` and `--dry-run`:

  ```shell
  helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
  --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \
  -f values-newrelic.yaml
  ```

  <Callout variant="important">
  Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.26.x or [a lower version that we support](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements).

  Kubernetes 1.27.x is currently in an experimental release phase. If you find any issues, please [contact support](https://support.newrelic.com). 
  </Callout>
6. Check that pods are being deployed and reach a stable state:

  ```shell
  kubectl -n newrelic get pods -w
  ```

You should see:

1. One `newrelic-nrk8s-ksm` pod.
2. One `newrelic-nrk8s-kubelet` pod for each node in your cluster.
3. One `newrelic-nrk8s-control-plane` pod for each master node in your cluster, if any.
4. One `newrelic-kube-state-metrics` pod, if you included KSM with our installation.
5. One `newrelic-nri-kube-events` pod, if you enabled Kubernetes events reporting.
6. One `prometheus-agent` pod, if you enabled the [Prometheus agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent) integration.
7. One `newrelic-newrelic-logging` pod for each node in your cluster, if you enabled the Logging integration.

## Configure the integration [#configure]

Our `nri-bundle` chart. whose installation instructions can be found above, acts as a wrapper or a meta-package for a couple of other charts, which are the ones containing the components for our solution. By offering such a wrapper we can provide a controlled set of our components with versions that we know are compatible with each other, while keeping the component's charts relatively simple.

The [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart wraps [multiple individual charts](#install-k8-helm) to gather different telemetry data and send it to New Relic. The bundle allows to selectively enable the desired child charts depending on your needs. To configure each individual component, you must use [Helm's dependency system](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#overriding-values-from-a-parent-chart), which in short means that the configuration for each child chart must be placed under a separate section (named after each child chart) in the [values-newrelic.yml file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/). For example, to configure the `newrelic-infrastructure` chart, you would add the following to the `values-newrelic.yaml`:

```yaml
# General settings that apply to all the child charts
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings as shown above

# Specific configuration for the newrelic-infrastructure child chart
newrelic-infrastructure:
  verboseLog: true  # Enable debug logs
  privileged: false  # Install with minimal privileges
  # Other options from https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-infrastructure-v3

# Specific configuration for the newrelic-logging child chart
newrelic-logging:
  fluentBit:
    retryLimit: 10
```

You can also pass child chart options through the command line by prefixing them with the child chart name and replace the nesting by dots:

```
helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
--namespace=newrelic \
--set global.licenseKey=_YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_ \
--set global.cluster=_K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_ \
--set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false \
--set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=true \
--set newrelic-logging.fluentBit.retryLimit=10
```

The full list of flags you can tweak (such as [scrape-interval](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/data-governance-optimize-ingest-guide#k8s-integration)) for each child chart can be found in their respective repositories:

* [`newrelic-infrastructure`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/tree/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure)
  * Configure debug logs, privilege mode, control plane monitoring, etc.
* [`nri-kube-events`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kube-events/tree/main/charts/nri-kube-events)
* [`nri-metadata-injection`](https://github.com/newrelic/k8s-metadata-injection/tree/main/charts/nri-metadata-injection)
  * Configure how the webhook for APM linkage is deployed.
  * Configure which Prometheus endpoints are scraped.
* [`newrelic-logging`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging)
  * Configure which logs or log attributes are sent to New Relic.
