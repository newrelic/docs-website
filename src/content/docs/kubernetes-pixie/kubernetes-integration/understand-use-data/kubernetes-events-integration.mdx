The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the [Kubernetes cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), or use the infrastructure [events UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

## Installation [#installation]

The Kubernetes events integration is installed by default both when using our [Guided Install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure), or when [installing through Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm).

## View your Kubernetes events [#use-data]

Once you've successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic.

To add events to your [dashboard](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards):

1. Add a chart to a [new or existing dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) or create a chart using the New Relic [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
2. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type **table** and use the following event query, replacing `YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your cluster:

   ```sql
   FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT
   event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.reason,event.message
   WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100
   ```

## Query events [#data-insights]

Here are a few examples to [query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data):

### Get attributes names [#attributes-names]

To see all the attributes names, use the following query:

```sql
FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes'
```

### See event details [#event-details]

To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing `YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME` with the name of your cluster:

```sql
FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,
event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE
category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'
```

The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the [Kubernetes event v1 core documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#event-v1-core).

### Search events in New Relic [#data-infrastructure]

To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI:

1. [Navigate to the Infrastructure event page](https://one.newrelic.com): Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Events**.
2. In **Category**, select **kubernetes**.
3. Use the <Icon name="fe-search"/>
   **Search events** field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the [filter set](/docs/scopes-organize-your-infrastructure).

### View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer [#data-cluster]

To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods:

* **In New Relic**: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes cluster explorer**.

Then, to view the pod details:

1. In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod.
2. Select **Show pod events**.

## Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector [#events-metrics]

To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus agent integration. To get started:

1. Install the New Relic [Prometheus agent integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/).
2. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is `prometheus.io/scrape=true`).

## Optional: Define custom attributes [#custom-attributes]

To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified in your
[values.yaml](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kube-events/blob/main/charts/nri-kube-events/values.yaml) under the `customAttributes` map.

For example, to add the attribute `environment` with value `dev` to all the events, add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yml
nri-kube-events:
  customAttributes:
    environment: dev
```

You can add other custom attributes globally to all other kubernetes integrations by setting it globally:

```yml
global:
  customAttributes:
    environment: dev
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration.

    To check the logs of our event collector:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events
    ```

    To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding `verbose: "true"` in the `config` section of you configuration file, either before or after the `clusterName`.

    To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic:
