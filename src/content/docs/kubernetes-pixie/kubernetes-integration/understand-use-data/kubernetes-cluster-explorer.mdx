The New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer uses the data collected by the [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) to show the status of your cluster, from the control plane to nodes and pods.

After [installing](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure) our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services that run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes/) page.

You can find out about the health of each entity, explore logs, and see how your apps are performing. With the [Events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), everything that happens in your cluster becomes visible, and logs brought in using the [logs plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-plugin-logs) are also available.

## Meet the cluster explorer [#cluster-explorer-use]

The cluster explorer represents your most relevant cluster data on a chart with the shape of a ship's wheel â€” which is also the Kubernetes logo.

* Outer ring: Contains **up to 24 nodes** of your cluster, the most relevant based on the amount of alerts. Hover over each node to check resource consumption and the percentage of allocable pods used.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Node Tooltip"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Node Tooltip"
  src={kubernetesClusterExplorerNodeTooltip}
/>

* Inner rings: Contain the pods (<img title="Pod" alt="Pod" src={kubernetesPod0} style={{height: "20px", width: "20px"}} />) of each node. Pods with active alerts are shown in the third innermost ring, and pods that are pending or unable to run are in the center.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer"
  src={kubernetesClusterExplorerRings}
/>

Hover the mouse over each node or pod to get a quick overview of its resource usage. You can click each node and pod to view its resource usage over time or to get more information about its health and active alerts. [Colors](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies) are based on [predefined alert conditions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy): Yellow pods have active warning alerts, while red pods have active critical alerts.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Pod alert"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Pod alert"
  src={kubernetesnr1PodAlert}
/>

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes**: Click any pod to get more information about its status and health, and to dig deeper into application data and traces, logs, and events.
</figcaption>

Click a node to see the following data:

* Pod statistics
* CPU, memory, and storage consumption against allocatable amounts
* Amount of pods used by the node against the allocatable amount of pods

For each pod, depending on the [integrations and features you've enabled](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration), you can see:

* Pod status and metadata, including namespace and deployment
* Container status and statistics
* Active alerts (both warning and critical)
* [Kubernetes events that happened in that pod](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration)
* APM data and traces (if you've [linked your APM data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes))
* A link to the pods' and containers' logs, collected using the [Kubernetes plugin for log management in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-plugin-logs)

Cluster and [control plane](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring) statistics are always visible on the left side.


### Cluster explorer node table [#cluster-explorer-table]

Below the cluster explorer is the node table, which shows all the nodes of the cluster, namespace, or deployment. Like all other usage indicators, the table shows consumption against [allocatable resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable).

## Search and filter your cluster data [#search-filter]

The main way to modify the data view in the cluster explorer is by using the top bar to search for specific attributes or values. All the [attributes and values collected by the Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data) can be combined to narrow down the cluster view.

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes cluster explorer**: All your Kubernetes cluster's attributes and data points can be used to filter the cluster explorer view.
</figcaption>

You can also change the time frame using the time picker in the upper right corner. The **Auto-refresh** box turns the cluster explorer into a real-time dashboard that refreshes every 60 seconds.

<img

## Cluster Overview dashboard [#cluster-overview-dashboard]

The cluster **Overview** dashboard can be an essential tool for monitoring and managing your Kubernetes clusters, providing real-time visibility into the health and performance of the containerized applications running on the cluster, and enabling administrators to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.


<img
  title="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
  alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
  src={clusterExplorerDashboardDetail}

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes > your_cluster > Overview**: You can access the Kubernetes dashboard within the Kubernetes cluster explorer. It shows useful overview data about the status and performance of the cluster and its containerized workloads.
</figcaption>


It's designed to help answer questions such as:

* Are there any pods that are pending or failed?
* Which Daemonsets, Deployments, Statefulsets, HPAs, or other Kubernetes resources are unhealthy?
* Are all nodes ready and able to host pods?
* How many pods, containers, nodes, or other Kubernetes resources are in the cluster?
* When did a spike in Kubernetes warning events occur?
* When did one or more pods enter a pending state?
* Are there any pods unable to be scheduled to a node?
* Can my nodes host additional pods?


<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend that you run `nri-kubernetes` version `3.2.0` or greater for the best experience.
  * In version `3.2.0`, a `containerRestartDelta` metric was introduced which is used on the `Container Restarts` widget.
  * In version `2.7.0`, Node status metrics were introduced which are used in the `Node Status Conditions` widget.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
  The cluster **Overview** dashboard does not currently include information about Jobs or CronJobs.
</Callout>

## Browse your Kubernetes events

If you've enabled the [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), you can click the **Events** tab to browse everything that happened in your cluster, from warnings to normal events. To set it up, select the **Kubernetes events** box in step 3 of [our install wizard](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install-wizard), or follow the [instructions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration#install).

## Kubernetes Navigator preview [#navigator-preview]

<Callout title="Preview">
  The Kubernetes Navigator UI is currently in preview. You can enable it using the `Preview the new Kubernetes experience` toggle in the Kubernetes cluster explorer.
</Callout>

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview Toggle"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview Toggle"
      src={k8sNavigatorPreviewToggle}
    />

  <figcaption>
    **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Summary**: Click the toggle to view the Kubernetes Navigator UI preview.
  </figcaption>

Our Kubernetes Navigator UI builds upon the concept of [New Relic Navigator](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-navigator) by enabling users to easily group entities and isolate high resource consumption, capacity issues, and alert status for pods, daemonsets, deployments, Statefulsets, and nodes.

The preview supports visualizing the following Kubernetes entity types:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity Type
      </th>
      <th>
        Metrics
      </th>
      <th>
        Group By
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Pod
      </td>
      <td>
        CPU Used (cores), Memory Used (bytes), Container Restarts, CPU Throttled (%), Network Rx (bytes/s), Network Tx (bytes/s), Alert Status, Filesystem Used (%), Warning Events, Start Time, Created At
      </td>
      <td>
        Namespace, Deployment, Pod, Node
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Deployment
      </td>
      <td>
        CPU Used (cores), Memory Used (bytes), Container Restarts, CPU Throttled (%), Network Rx (bytes/s), Network Tx (bytes/s), Alert Status, Filesystem Used (%), Warning Events, Start Time, Created At
      </td>
      <td>
        Namespace, Deployment
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Statefulset
      </td>
      <td>
        Pods Missing (#), Pods Missing (%), Alert Status, Created At
      </td>
      <td>
        Namespace, Statefulset
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Daemonset
      </td>
      <td>
        Pods Missing (#), Pods Missing (%), Alert Status, Created At
      </td>
      <td>
        Namespace, Daemonset
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Node
      </td>
      <td>
        Allocatable CPU Used (%), Allocatable Memory Used (%), FS Capacity Used (%), Pending Pods, Failed Pods, Alert Status
      </td>
      <td>
        All Nodes, Node
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use the dropdown filters to select an **Entity type**, **Metric**, and **Group by**. These give you control over the visualization.

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview Options"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview Options"
      src={k8sNavigatorPreviewOptions}
    />


Capacity and utilization metrics are colored using a blue gradient which indicates whether a metric value is high (dark blue) or low (light blue/white). The upper and lower bound of the legend dynamically updates based on the metric selected and any filters that have been applied.  

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Preview"
      src={k8sNavigatorPreviewPods}
    />


When selecting the `Alert status` metric, entities are colored according to alert violations that are currently open in the New Relic platform.

* Red for critical
* Yellow for warning
* Green for non-alerting entities
* Gray for entities not targeted by an alert condition


  <img
    title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Alert Status"
    alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Alert Status"
    src={k8sNavigatorPreviewAlerts}
  />


Use the filter bar or interact with the grouping headers to apply filters to scope the UI to a specific node, namespace, deployment, or something else.

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Filtering"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Filtering"
      src={k8sNavigatorPreviewFiltering}
    />

Hover over an entity to view its alert status and the value of the metric selected in the dropdown. Click to open a panel with more details about the selected entity. These details include tags, golden signals, logs, and access to more detailed entity dashboard pages via the `Details` links.
