The New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer uses the data collected by the [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) to show the status of your cluster, from the control plane to nodes and pods.

After [installing](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure) our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services that run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes/) page.

You can find out about the health of each entity, explore logs, and see how your apps are performing. With the [Events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), everything that happens in your cluster becomes visible, and logs brought in using the [logs plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-plugin-logs) are also available.


## Meet the Kubernetes navigator [#navigator-preview]

The Kubernetes navigator UI is a Kubernetes version of our [New Relic Navigator](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-navigator). It enables users to easily group entities and isolate high resource consumption, capacity issues, and alert status for `Pods`, `Deployments`, `DaemonSets`, `Job`, `CronJob`, `StatefulSets`, `Nodes`, and `Container`.

The navigator supports visualizing the following Kubernetes entity types:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity Type
      </th>
      <th>

Use the dropdown filters to select an **Entity type**, **Metric**, and **Group by**. These give you control over the visualization.

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Options"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Options"
      src={k8sNavigatorOptions}
    />

Capacity and utilization metrics are colored using a blue gradient which indicates whether a metric value is high (dark blue) or low (light blue/white). The upper and lower bound of the legend dynamically updates based on the metric selected and any filters that have been applied.

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator"
      src={k8sNavigatorPods}
    />


When selecting the `Alert status` metric, entities are colored according to alert incidents that are currently open in the New Relic platform.

* Red for critical
* Yellow for warning
* Green for non-alerting entities
* Gray for entities not targeted by an alert condition

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Alert Status"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Alert Status"
      src={k8sNavigatorAlerts}
    />

Use the filter bar or interact with the grouping headers to apply filters to scope the UI to a specific node, namespace, deployment, or something else.

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Filtering"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Filtering"
      src={k8sNavigatorFiltering}
    />

Hover over an entity to view its alert status and the value of the metric selected in the dropdown. Click to open a panel with more details about the selected entity. These details include tags, golden signals, logs, and access to more detailed entity dashboard pages via the `Details` links.

## Details on Kubernetes entities [#entities]

Some resources for learning about Kubernetes-related entities:

* [Learn about entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic)
* For details on how long entities last in New Relic, and other details, see the Kubernetes-related entities in [our entity definitions repo](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/tree/main/entity-types).

## Cluster Overview dashboard [#cluster-overview-dashboard]

The cluster **Overview** dashboard can be an essential tool for monitoring and managing your Kubernetes clusters. It provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of the containerized applications running on the cluster, and enables administrators to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
  alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
  src={clusterExplorerDashboardDetail}
/>
<figcaption>
  Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes**. Select your cluster and click **Overview Dashboard** in the left navigation pane. It shows useful overview data about the status and performance of the cluster and its containerized workloads.
</figcaption>


It's designed to help answer questions such as:

* Are there any pods that are pending or failed?
* Which Daemonsets, Deployments, Statefulsets, HPAs, or other Kubernetes resources are unhealthy?
* Are all nodes ready and able to host pods?
* How many pods, containers, nodes, or other Kubernetes resources are in the cluster?
* When did a spike in Kubernetes warning events occur?
* When did one or more pods enter a pending state?
* Are there any pods unable to be scheduled to a node?
* Can my nodes host additional pods?

<Callout variant="tip">
  The cluster **Overview** dashboard does not currently include information about Jobs or CronJobs.
</Callout>

## Browse your Kubernetes events

If you've enabled the [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), you can click the **Kubernetes events** in the left pane to browse everything that happened in your cluster, from warnings to normal events. To set it up, select the **Kubernetes Events** box in step 3 of [our install wizard](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install-wizard), or follow the [instructions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration#install).

## Use the cluster explorer [#cluster-explorer-use]

<Callout title="Deprecated">
  The new Kubernetes Navigator UI is intended to replace the Cluster Explorer. However, you can enable the original Cluster Explorer experience at any time by turning off the Navigator toggle switch.
</Callout>

    <img
      title="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Toggle"
      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator Toggle"
      src={k8sNavigatorToggle}
    />

  <figcaption>
    **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Summary**: Click the toggle to return to the Kubernetes Navigator UI.
  </figcaption>

The cluster explorer represents your most relevant cluster data on a chart with the shape of a ship's wheel — which is also the Kubernetes logo.

* Outer ring: Contains **up to 24 nodes** of your cluster, the most relevant based on the amount of alerts. Hover over each node to check resource consumption and the percentage of allocable pods used.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Node Tooltip"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Node Tooltip"
  src={kubernetesClusterExplorerNodeTooltip}
/>

* Inner rings: Contain the pods (<img title="Pod" alt="Pod" src={kubernetesPod0} style={{height: "20px", width: "20px"}} />) of each node. Pods with active alerts are shown in the third innermost ring, and pods that are pending or unable to run are in the center.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer"
  src={kubernetesClusterExplorerRings}
/>

Hover the mouse over each node or pod to get a quick overview of its resource usage. You can click each node and pod to view its resource usage over time or to get more information about its health and active alerts. [Colors](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies) are based on [predefined alert conditions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy): Yellow pods have active warning alerts, while red pods have active critical alerts.

<img
  title="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Pod alert"
  alt="New Relic - Cluster explorer - Pod alert"
  src={kubernetesnr1PodAlert}
/>

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes**: Click any pod to get more information about its status and health, and to dig deeper into application data and traces, logs, and events.
</figcaption>

Click a node to see the following data:

* Pod statistics
* CPU, memory, and storage consumption against allocatable amounts
* Amount of pods used by the node against the allocatable amount of pods

For each pod, depending on the [integrations and features you've enabled](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration), you can see:

* Pod status and metadata, including namespace and deployment
* Container status and statistics
* Active alerts (both warning and critical)
* [Kubernetes events that happened in that pod](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration)
* APM data and traces (if you've [linked your APM data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes))
* A link to the pods' and containers' logs, collected using the [Kubernetes plugin for <InlinePopover type="logs" /> in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-plugin-logs)

Cluster and [control plane](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring) statistics are always visible on the left side.


### Cluster explorer node table [#cluster-explorer-table]

Below the cluster explorer is the node table, which shows all the nodes of the cluster, namespace, or deployment. Like all other usage indicators, the table shows consumption against [allocatable resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable).

## Search and filter your cluster data [#search-filter]

The main way to modify the data view in the cluster explorer is by using the top bar to search for specific attributes or values. All the [attributes and values collected by the Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data) can be combined to narrow down the cluster view.

<img

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes cluster explorer**: All your Kubernetes cluster's attributes and data points can be used to filter the cluster explorer view.
</figcaption>

You can also change the time frame using the time picker in the upper right corner. The **Auto-refresh** box turns the cluster explorer into a real-time dashboard that refreshes every 60 seconds.

<img
