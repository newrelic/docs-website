[New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure) provides [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components) support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's control plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to [create queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Unless otherwise specified, this page refers to the [Kubernetes integration v3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3). Details on how to configure control plane monitoring for v2 can be found in a specific section below.
</Callout>

## Features [#control-plane-integration-features]

We monitor and collect [metrics](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#metrics) from the following control plane components:

* **etcd**: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see [etcd data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#etcd-data).
* **API server**: rate of `apiserver` requests, breakdown of `apiserver` requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see [API server data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#api-server-data).
* **Scheduler**: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see [Scheduler data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#scheduler-data).
* **Controller manager**: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see [Controller manager data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#controller-manager-data).

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

* Most managed clusters, including AKS, EKS and GKE, don't allow outside access to their control plane components. That's why on managed clusters, New Relic can only obtain control plane metrics for the API server, and not for etcd, the scheduler, or the controller manager.
* When deploying the solution in [unprivileged mode](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#unprivileged), control plane setup will require [extra steps](#hostnetwork-privileged) and some caveats might apply.
* [OpenShift](http://learn.openshift.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG) 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default.

## Control plane component [#component]

The task of monitoring the Kubernetes control plane is a responsibility of the `nrk8s-controlplane` component, which by default is deployed as a DaemonSet. This component is automatically deployed to master nodes, through the use of a default list of `nodeSelectorTerms` which includes labels commonly used to identify master nodes, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`. Regardless, this selector is exposed in the `values.yml` file and therefore can be reconfigured to fit other environments.

Clusters that do not have any node matching these selectors will not get any pod scheduled, thus not wasting any resources and being functionally equivalent of disabling control plane monitoring altogether by setting `controlPlane.enabled` to `false` in the Helm Chart.

Each component of the control plane has a dedicated section, which allows to individually:

* Enable or disable monitoring of that component
* Define specific selectors and namespaces for discovering that component
* Define the endpoints and paths that will be used to fetch metrics for that component
* Define the authentication mechanisms that need to be used to get metrics for that component
* Manually specify endpoints that skip autodiscovery completely

  alt="Diagram showing a possible configuration scraping etcd with mTLS and API server with bearer Token. The monitoring is a DaemonSet deployed on master nodes only."

/>

You can check all configuration options available in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure/values.yaml) of the nri-kubernetes chart under the `controlPlane` key.

If you're installing the integration through the `nri-bundle` chart you need to [pass the values to the corresponding subchart](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/). For example to disable the `etcd` monitoring in the `controlPlane` component you can do the following:

```yaml
newrelic-infrastructure:
  controlPlane:
    config:
      etcd:
        enabled: false
```

### Autodiscovery and default configuration [#autodiscovery-default]

By default, our [Helm Chart](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm) ships a configuration that should work out of the box for some control plane components for on-premise distributions that run the control plane inside the cluster, such as `Kubeadm` or `minikube`.

Notice that since autodiscovery relies on pod labels as a discovery mechanism, it does not work in cloud environments or whenever the control plane compoenents are not running inside the cluster.
However, [static endpoint](#static-endpoints) can be leveraged in these scenarios if control plane components are reachable.

#### `hostNetwork` and `privileged` [#hostnetwork-privileged]

In versions lower than v3, when the integration is deployed using `privileged: false`, the `hostNetwork` setting for the control plane component will be also be set to `false`.

In versions 3 and above, the `privileged` flag affects only the `securityContext` objects, that is, whether containers are run as root with access to host metrics or not. All the integration components default now to `hostNetwork: false`, except the pods that get metrics from the control plane that have `hostNetwork: true` as it is required to reach the control plane endpoints in most distributions. The `hostNetwork` value for all components can be changed, individually or globally, using [the `hostNetwork` toggle in your `values.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library#values-managed-globally).

If running pods with `hostNetwork` is not acceptable whatsoever, due to cluster or other policies, control plane monitoring is not possible and should be disabled by setting `controlPlane.enabled` to `false`.

If you have some advanced configuration that includes [custom autodiscovery](#autodiscovery-default) or [static endpoint](#static-endpoints) that can be used to monitor the control plane without `hostNetwork` check [project's README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure/README.md) and look for `controlPlane.hostNetwork` toogle in the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure/values.yaml).

#### Custom autodiscovery [#autodiscovery-default]

Selectors used for autodiscovery are completely exposed as configuration entries in the `values.yaml` file, which means they can be tweaked or replaced to fit almost any environment where the control plane is run as a part of the cluster.

An autodiscovery section looks like the following:

```yaml
autodiscover:
  - selector: "tier=control-plane,component=etcd"
    namespace: kube-system
    # Set to true to consider only pods sharing the node with the scraper pod.
    # This should be set to `true` if Kind is Daemonset, `false` otherwise.
    matchNode: true
    # Try to reach etcd using the following endpoints.
    endpoints:
      - url: https://localhost:4001
        insecureSkipVerify: true
        auth:
          type: bearer
      - url: http://localhost:2381
  - selector: "k8s-app=etcd-manager-main"
    namespace: kube-system
    matchNode: true
    endpoints:
      - url: https://localhost:4001
        insecureSkipVerify: true
        auth:
          type: bearer
```

The `autodiscover` section contains a list of autodiscovery entries. Each entry has:

* `selector`: A string-encoded label selector that will be used to look for pods.
* `matchNode`: If set to true, it will additionally limit discovery to pods running in the same node as the particular instance of the DaemonSet performing discovery.
* `endpoints`: A list of endpoints to try if a pod is found for the specified selector.

Additionally, each `endpoint` has:

* `url`: URL to target, including scheme. Can be `http` or `https`.
* `insecureSkipVerify`: If set to true, certificate will not be checked for `https` URLs.
* `auth.type`: Which mechanism to use to authenticate the request. Currently, the following methods are supported:
* None: If `auth` is not specified, the request will not contain any authentication whatsoever.
* `bearer`: The same bearer token used to authenticate against the Kubernetes API will be sent to this request.
* `mtls`: mTLS will be used to perform the request.

##### mTLS [#mtls]

For the `mtls` type, the following needs to be specified:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - url: https://localhost:4001
    auth:
      type: mtls
      mtls:
        secretName: secret-name
        secretNamespace: secret-namespace
```

Where `secret-name` is the name of a Kubernetes TLS Secret, which lives in `secret-namespace`, and contains the certificate, key, and CA required to connect to that particular endpoint.

The integration fetches this secret in runtime rather than mounting it, which means it requires an RBAC role granting it access to it. Our Helm Chart automatically detects `auth.mtls` entries at render time and will automatically create entries for these particular secrets and namespaces for you, unless `rbac.create` is set to false.

Our integration accepts a secret with the following keys:

* `cacert`: The PEM-encoded CA certificate used to sign the `cert`
* `cert`: The PEM-encoded certificate that will be presented to etcd
* `key`: The PEM-encoded private key corresponding to the certificate above

These certificates should be signed by the same CA etcd is using to operate.

How to generate these certificates is out of the scope of this documentation, as it will vary greatly between different Kubernetes distribution. Please refer to your distribution's documentation to see how to fetch the required etcd peer certificates. In Kubeadm, for example, they can be found in `/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.{crt,key}` in the master node.

Once you have located or generated the etcd peer certificates, you should rename the files to match the keys we expect to be present in the secret, and create the secret in the cluster

```shell
mv peer.crt cert
mv peer.key key
mv ca.crt cacert

kubectl -n newrelic create secret tls newrelic-etcd-tls-secret --cert=./cert --key=./key --certificate-authority=./cacert
```

Finally, you can input the secret name (`newrelic-etcd-tls-secret`) and namespace (`newrelic`) in the config snippet shown at the beginning of this section. Remember that the Helm Chart will automatically parse this config and create an RBAC role to grant access to this specific secret and namespace for the `nrk8s-controlplane` component, so there's no manual action needed in that regard.

### Static endpoints [#static-endpoints]

While autodiscovery should cover cases where the control plane lives inside the Kubernetes clusters, some distributions or sophisticated Kubernetes environments run the control plane elsewhere, for a variety of reasons including availability or resource isolation.

For these cases, the integration can be configured to scrape an arbitrary, fixed URL regardless of whether a pod with a control plane label is found in the node. This is done by specifying a `staticEndpoint` entry. For example, one for an external etcd instance would look like this:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  etcd:
    staticEndpoint:
      url: https://url:port
      insecureSkipVerify: true
      auth: {}
```

<img
  title="Diagram showing a possible configuration scraping an external API server with bearer Token."
  alt="Diagram showing a possible configuration scraping an external API server with bearer Token. The monitoring is a Deployment with a single replica."
  src={kubernetesIntegrationCpExternal}
/>

`staticEndpoint` is the same type of entry as `endpoints` in the `autodiscover` entry, whose fields are described above. The authentication mechanisms and schemas are supported here.

Please keep in mind that if `staticEndpoint` is set, the `autodiscover` section will be ignored in its entirety.

#### Limitations [#static-endpoints-limitations]

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're using `staticEndpoint` pointing to an out-of-node (i.e. not `localhost`) endpoint, you must change `controlPlane.kind` from `DaemonSet` to `Deployment`.
</Callout>

When using `staticEndpoint`, all `nrk8s-controlplane` pods will attempt to reach and scrape said endpoint. This means that, if `nrk8s-controlplane` is a DaemonSet (the default), all instances of the DaemonSet will scrape this endpoint. While this is fine if you're pointing them to `localhost`, if the endpoint is not local to the node you could potentially produce to duplicate metrics and increased billable usage. If you're using `staticEndpoint` and pointing it to a non-local URL, make sure to change `controlPlane.kind` to Deployment.

For the same reason above, it is currently not possible to use autodiscovery for some control plane components, and a static endpoint for others. This is a known limitation we are working to address in future versions of the integration.

Lastly, `staticEndpoint` allows only to define a single endpoint per component. This means that if you have multiple control plane shards in different hosts, it is currently not possible to point to them separately. This is also a known limitation we are working to address in future versions. For the time being, a workaround could be to aggregate metrics for different shards elsewhere, and point the `staticEndpoint` URL to the aggregated output.

#### Control plane monitoring for managed and cloud environments [#cloud-control-plane]

Some cloud environments, like EKS or GKE, allow retrieving metrics from the Kubernetes API Server. This can be easily configured as an static endpoint:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  affinity: false  # https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9136
  kind: Deployment
  # `hostNetwork` is not required for monitoring API Server on AKS, EKS
  hostNetwork: false
  config:
    etcd:
      enabled: false
    scheduler:
      enabled: false
    controllerManager:
      enabled: false
    apiServer:
     staticEndpoint:
       url: "https://kubernetes.default:443"
       insecureSkipVerify: true
       auth:
         type: bearer
```

Please note that this only applies to the API Server and that etcd, the scheduler, and the controller manager remain inaccessible in cloud environments.

Moreover, be aware that, depending on the specific managed or cloud environment, the Kubernetes service could be loadbalancing the traffic among different instances of the API Server. In this case, the metrics that depends on the specific instance being selected by the loadbalancer are not reliable.

#### Control plane monitoring for Rancher RKE1 [#rancher]

Clusters deployed leveraging Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE1) run control plane components as Docker containers, and not as Pods managed by the Kubelet. 
That's why the integration can't autodiscover those containers, and every endpoint needs to be manually specified in the `staticEndpoint` section of the integration configuration.

The integration needs to be able to reach the different endpoints either by connecting directly, with the available authentication methods 
(service account token, custom mTLS certificates, or none), or through a proxy.

For example, in order to make the Scheduler and the Controller Manager metrics reachable, you might need to add the `--authorization-always-allow-paths` [flag](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/), allowing `/metrics` or `--authentication-kubeconfig` and `--authorization-kubeconfig` to enable token authentication.

Assuming that every component is reachable at the specified port, the following configuration will monitor the API Server, the Scheduler and the Controller Manager: 

```yaml
controlPlane:
  kind: DaemonSet
  config:
    scheduler:
      enabled: true
      staticEndpoint:
        url: https://localhost:10259
        insecureSkipVerify: true
        auth:
          type: bearer
    controllerManager:
      enabled: true
      staticEndpoint:
        url: https://localhost:10257
        insecureSkipVerify: true
        auth:
          type: bearer
    apiServer:
      enabled: true
      staticEndpoint:
        url: https://localhost:6443
        insecureSkipVerify: true
        auth:
          type: bearer
```

In this example, the integration needs to run on the same node of each control plane component that has the `hostNetwork` option set to true, since it's connecting locally to each `staticEndpoint`. Therefore, `controlPlane.kind` has to be kept as `DaemonSet`. Also, the DaemonSet needs affinity rules, nodeSelector, and tolerations configured so that all instances are running on all control plane nodes you want to monitor.

You can recognize the control plane nodes by checking the `node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane` label. This label is already taken into account by the integration default affinity rules.

## Monitoring control plane with integration version 2 [#monitoring-control-plane]

This section covers how to configure control plane monitoring on versions 2 and earlier of the integration.

Please note that these versions had a less flexible autodiscovery options, and did not support external endpoints. We strongly recommend you to update to [version 3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3) at your earliest convenience. [See what's changed](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3) of the Kubernetes integration.

    ## Discovery of master nodes and control plane components [#discover-nodes-components]

    The Kubernetes integration relies on the [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""` or `kubernetes.io/role="master"`.

    The control plane components should have either the `k8s-app` or the `tier` and `component` labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "110px" }}>
            Component
          </th>

          <th>
            Label
          </th>

          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Endpoint
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>

          </td>

          <td>
            **Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI**

            `k8s-app=kube-apiserver`

            `tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver`

            **OpenShift**

            `app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true`
          </td>

          <td>
            `localhost:443/metrics` by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to `localhost:8080/metrics`
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>

            **OpenShift**

            `k8s-app=etcd`

            **OpenShift**

            `app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true`
          </td>

          <td>
            `localhost:10251/metrics`
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Controller manager
          </td>

          <td>
            **Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI**

            `k8s-app=kube-controller-manager`

            `tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​`

            **OpenShift**

            `app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true`
          </td>

          <td>
            `localhost:10252/metrics`
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint.

    ### Configuration

    Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is etcd, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the [Secure Port](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/controlling-access/#api-server-ports-and-ips).

    <Callout variant="important">
      Control plane monitoring for [OpenShift](http://learn.openshift.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG) 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the [OpenShift 4.x Configuration](#openshift-4x-configuration) section.
    </Callout>

    #### etcd

    In order to set mTLS for querying etcd, there are two configuration options that need to be set:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "280px" }}>
            Option
          </th>

          <th>
            Value
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME`
          </td>

          <td>
            Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration.

            The secret should contain the following keys:

            * `cert`: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an etcd trusted CA.
            * `key`: the private key used to generate the client certificate.
            * `cacert`: the root CA used to identify the etcd server certificate.

              If the `ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME` option is not set, etcd metrics won't be fetched.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE`
          </td>

          <td>
            The namespace where the secret specified in the `ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME` was created. If not set, the `default` namespace is used.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    #### API server

    By default, the API server metrics are queried using the `localhost:8080` unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
            Option
          </th>

          <th>
            Value
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL`
          </td>

          <td>
            The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses `localhost:443` by default

            Ensure that the `ClusterRole` has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest

            Added in version 1.15.0
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <Callout variant="important">
      Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server.

      For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore `API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL` should be set to `https://localhost:8443`

## OpenShift configuration [#openshift-4x-configuration]

Version 3 of the Kubernetes Integration includes default settings that will autodiscover control plane components in OpenShift clusters, so it should work out of the box for all components except etcd.

Etcd is not supported out of the box as the metrics endpoint is configured to require mTLS authentication in OpenShift environments. Our integration supports mTLS authentication to fetch etcd metrics in this configuration, however you will need to create the required mTLS certificate manually. This is necessary to avoid granting wide permissions to our integration without the explicit approval from the user.

To create an mTLS secret, please follow the steps in [this section below](#mtls-how-to-openshift), and then configure the integration to use the newly created secret as described in [the mtls section](#mtls).

    Control plane components on [OpenShift](http://learn.openshift.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG) 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, [the default](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#discover-nodes-components) endpoint URLs can not be used.

    To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the [customized manifest](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure#customized-manifest). URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in [OpenShift](http://learn.openshift.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG) 4.x.

    ```
    - name: "SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL"
      value: "https://localhost:10259
    - name: "ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL"
      value: "https://localhost:9979"
    - name: "CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL"
      value: "https://localhost:10257"
    - name: "API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL"
      value: "https://localhost:6443"
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      Even though the custom `ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL` is defined, etcd requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for etcd in OpenShift, see [Set up mTLS for etcd in OpenShift](#mtls-how-to-openshift).

### Set up mTLS for etcd in OpenShift [#mtls-how-to-openshift]

Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for etcd in [OpenShift](http://learn.openshift.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG) 4.x:

1. Export the etcd client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named `kube-etcd-client-certs` and it is stored in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl get secret etcd-client -n openshift-etcd -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml
   ```

  The content of the etcd-secret.yaml would look something like the following.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      tls.crt: <CERT VALUE>
      tls.key: <KEY VALUE>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: "2023-03-23T23:19:17Z"
      name: etcd-client
      namespace: openshift-etcd
      resourceVersion: 
      uid: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    type: kubernetes.io/tls   
   ```

2. Optionally, change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. The next steps assume secret name and namespace are changed to `mysecret` and `newrelic` respectively.

3. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section:
   * `creationTimestamp`
   * `resourceVersion`
   * `uid`

4. Install the manifest with its new name and namespace:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -n newrelic -f etcd-secret.yaml
   ```

5. Configure the integration to use the newly created secret as described in [the mtls section](#mtls). This can be done by adding the following configuration in the `values.yaml` if you're installing the integration through the `nri-bundle` chart.

 ```yaml
 newrelic-infrastructure:
  controlPlane:
    enabled: true
    config:
      etcd:
        enabled: true
        autodiscover:
          - selector: "app=etcd,etcd=true,k8s-app=etcd"
            namespace: openshift-etcd
            matchNode: true
            endpoints:
              - url: https://<ETCD_ENDPOINT>:<PORT>
                insecureSkipVerify: true
                auth:
                  type: mTLS
                  mtls:
                    secretName: mysecret
                    secretNamespace: newrelic
 ```



## See your data [#check-integration-works]

If the integration has been been set up correctly, the [Kubernetes cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer) contains all the control plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below.
