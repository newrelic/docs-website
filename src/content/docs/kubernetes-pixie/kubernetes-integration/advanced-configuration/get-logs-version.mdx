To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow these procedures.

    For the Kubernetes integration debug level logs are not produced. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.

     - To get verbose logging details using Helm and `nri-bundle` chart it is enough to add to the values.yaml `newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog`. Notice that you can enable them in all subcharts setting `global.verboseLog`.
        
        ```yaml
        # To enable verboseLog for newrelic-infrastructure only
        # newrelic-infrastructure:
        #   verboseLog: true

        # To enable verboseLog for all sub-charts
        # global:
        #   verboseLog: true
        ```
       
        Once you have edited the files, upgrade the solution with the following command:

        ```shell
        helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> newrelic/nri-bundle \
        --namespace <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE> \
        -f values-newrelic.yaml \
        [--version fixed-chart-version]
        ```

        Then wait some time, collect the logs, revert the change in the `values.yaml` file, and upgrade again.

     - To get verbose logging details for an integration manually using a manifest file you need to set two different environment variables:
       1. `NRIA_VERBOSE="1"` for all `agent` and `forwarder` containers. For example below the `NRIA_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. This environment variable enables agent verbose logs.
       2. set `NRI_KUBERNETES_VERBOSE=true"` in all components  of the integration. This environment variable enables verbose logs of the integration.

       Once you have edited the manifest upgrade the solution with the following command. Then wait some time, collect the logs, revert the change in the manifest and apply the manifest again.
       
       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
       ```

    There are three different components of the integration in charge of scraping `ksm`, `controlplane` and `kubelet`. 
    In in each instance two containers are running, one scraping the data and one forwarding it. 
    The agent in the kubelet component is in charge also to scrape node data and run integrations.

    To fetch logs, get the name of the pods you want to retrieve logs from:
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
    ```
    
    Retrieve the logs: 
    ```shell
    kubectl logs <POD_NAME> --all-containers --prefix
    ```

    If you interested into the logs of the previous execution add the `--previous` flag. If you are interested in the logs of just one of the containers you can avoid `--all-containers --prefix` flags and specify the container with the `--container` option.

    <Callout variant="important">
      To have the best experience with our Kubernetes integration, we advice you to be on the last version of our integration. Check [what changes got introduced with version 3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3).
    </Callout>

    For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version.

    When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE 'agent' FACET clusterName, containerImage
    ```

    If the agent isn't reporting any data:

    Get the versions of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using `kubectl`:
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=newrelic-infrastructure -o jsonpath="{.items..spec..containers..image}"
    ```

    For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent adds a log entry only in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.
    </Callout>

    To get verbose logging details for an integration using a manifest file:

    1. Enable `verbose` logging: In the deployment file, set the value of `NRIA_VERBOSE` to `1`.
    2. Apply the modified configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml
       ```
    3. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until you feel enough activity has occurred.
    4. Disable verbose mode: Set the `NRIA_VERBOSE` value back to `0`.
    5. Apply the restored configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml
       ```
    6. Get a list of nodes in the environment:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces
       ```
    7. Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics'
       ```
    8. [Get logs from the pods connecting to kube-state-metrics](#logs-pod-kubestatemetrics).

    To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm:

    1. Enable verbose logging:
       ```shell
       helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle
       ```
    2. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred.
    3. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging:
       ```shell
       helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle
       ```
    4. Follow the steps to restore your configuration from step 5 in the section, [Get verbose logs for installations using a manifest file](#verbose-with-manifest).

    To get the logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics:

    1. Get the nodes that kube-state-metrics is running on:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell

       Running   4          4d        172.17.0.3   minikube
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on the same node as kube-state-metrics:

       ```shell
       kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       default                    newrelic-infra-5wcv6                     100m (5%)
       0 (0%)      100Mi (5%)       100Mi (5%)
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6
       ```

    To get the logs from a pod running on a master node:

    1. Get the nodes that are labelled as master:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""
       ```

       Or,

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role="master"
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell

       ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal   Ready   master  42d   v1.14.8
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
