To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow the steps below. If you are using version 2 of the integration, skip to [this section](#version2-instructions).

    The Kubernetes integration does not produce `debug` level logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Only enable this mode temporarily for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.
    </Callout>

     - To get verbose logging details using Helm and the `nri-bundle` chart, add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file. You can also enable verbose logging for all subcharts:
        
        ```yaml
        # To enable verboseLog for newrelic-infrastructure only
        # newrelic-infrastructure:
        #   verboseLog: true

        # To enable verboseLog for all sub-charts
        # global:
        #   verboseLog: true
        ```
       
        Once you have added the desired configuration, upgrade the solution with the following command:

        ```shell
        helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> newrelic/nri-bundle \
        --namespace <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE> \
        -f values-newrelic.yaml \
        [--version fixed-chart-version]
        ```

        After collecting your verbose logs, revert the change in your `values.yaml` file, and run the `upgrade` command again. 

     - To get verbose logging details using a manifest file, you need to set two different environment variables:
       1. `NRIA_VERBOSE="1"` for all `agent` and `forwarder` containers; this enables agent verbose logs. You can set this below `NRIA_LICENSE_KEY`.
       2. set `NRI_KUBERNETES_VERBOSE=true"` in all components  of the integration; this enables verbose logs for the integration.

        ```yaml
        env:
        - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
            key: licenseKey
            name: newrelic-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure-license
        - name: NRIA_VERBOSE
          value: "1"
        ```

       Once you have edited the manifest, upgrade the solution with the following command: 
       
       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
       ```
       
       After collecting your verbose logs, revert the change in the manifest, and apply the manifest again.

    There are three different components of the integration that are in charge of scraping `ksm`, `controlplane`, and `kubelet`. 
    In each instance, there are two containers running, with one scraping the data and the other one forwarding it. 
    The agent in the `kubelet` component is also in charge of scraping node data and running integrations. The diagram below shows the integration installed in a cluster with three nodes. 

    <img
      title="Diagram showing the integration installed in a 3 nodes cluster"
      alt="Diagram showing the integration installed in a 3 nodes cluster"
      src={kubernetesV3Integration}
    />

    To fetch logs, get the name of the pods you want to retrieve logs from:
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
    ```
    
    Retrieve the logs: 
    ```shell
    kubectl logs <POD_NAME> --all-containers --prefix
    ```

    To retrieve logs from the previous execution, add the `--previous` flag. To get logs from only one of the containers, remove the `--all-containers --prefix` flag and specify the container with the `--container` option.

    <Callout variant="important">
      For the best experience with our Kubernetes integration, we recommend that you use the latest version. Check out [the changes introduced in version 3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3).
    </Callout>

    When you use the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains both the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version.

    Once the agent is sending data to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE 'agent' FACET clusterName, containerImage
    ```

    If the agent isn't reporting any data:

    Get the versions of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using `kubectl`:
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=newrelic-infrastructure -o jsonpath="{.items..spec..containers..image}"
    ```

    For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent only adds a log entry in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Only enable this mode temporarily for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.
    </Callout>

    To enable verbose logging using a manifest file:

    1. Enable verbose logging: In the deployment file, set the value of `NRIA_VERBOSE` to `1`.
    2. Apply the modified configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml
       ```
    3. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred.
    4. Disable verbose mode: Set the `NRIA_VERBOSE` value back to `0`.
    5. Apply the restored configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml
       ```
    6. Get a list of nodes in the environment:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces
       ```
    7. Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics'
       ```
    8. [Get logs from the pods connecting to `kube-state-metrics`](#logs-pod-kubestatemetrics).
    9. [Retrieve `kube-state-metrics` service configuration](#kube-state-metrics-version).

    To enable verbose logging using Helm:

    1. Run the following command:
       ```shell
       helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle
       ```
    2. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred.
    3. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging:
       ```shell

       ```

    To get the logs from pods connecting to `kube-state-metrics`:

    1. Run the following command:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       kube-system   kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh     2/2
       Running   4          4d        172.17.0.3   minikube
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on the same node as `kube-state-metrics`:

       ```shell
       kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       default                    newrelic-infra-5wcv6                     100m (5%)
       0 (0%)      100Mi (5%)       100Mi (5%)
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6
       ```

    To get the logs from a pod running on a master node:

    1. Get the nodes that are labelled as master:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""
       ```

       Or,

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role="master"
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       NAME                         STATUS  ROLES   AGE   VERSION
       ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal   Ready   master  42d   v1.14.8
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
