To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow the steps below. For troubleshooting help, see [Not seeing data](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/troubleshooting/kubernetes-integration-troubleshooting-not-seeing-data) or [Error messages](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/troubleshooting/kubernetes-integration-troubleshooting-error-messages).

If you're using version 2 of the integration, see [Kubernetes logs in version 2](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/k8s-version2/overview/#logs-version2).

    The Kubernetes integration does not produce `debug` level logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Only enable this mode temporarily for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.
    </Callout>

    * To get verbose logging details using Helm and the `nri-bundle` chart, add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file. You can also enable verbose logging for all subcharts:

      ```yaml
      # To enable verboseLog for newrelic-infrastructure only
      # newrelic-infrastructure:
      #   verboseLog: true

      # To enable verboseLog for all sub-charts
      # global:
      #   verboseLog: true
      ```

      Once you have added the desired configuration, upgrade the solution with the following command:

      ```shell
      helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> newrelic/nri-bundle \
      --namespace <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE> \
      -f values-newrelic.yaml \
      [--version fixed-chart-version]
      ```

      After collecting your verbose logs, revert the change in your `values.yaml` file, and run the `upgrade` command again.

    * To get verbose logging details using a manifest file, you need to set two different environment variables:

      1. `NRIA_VERBOSE="1"` for all `agent` and `forwarder` containers; this enables agent verbose logs. You can set this below `NRIA_LICENSE_KEY`.
      2. set `NRI_KUBERNETES_VERBOSE=true"` in all components  of the integration; this enables verbose logs for the integration.

         ```yaml
         env:
         ```

      * name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY
        valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
        key: licenseKey
        name: newrelic-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure-license
      * name: NRIA_VERBOSE
        value: "1"
        ```

        ```

      Once you have edited the manifest, upgrade the solution with the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl apply -f your_newrelic_k8s.yaml -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
      ```

      After collecting your verbose logs, revert the change in the manifest, and apply the manifest again.

    There are three different components of the integration that are in charge of scraping `ksm`, `controlplane`, and `kubelet`.
    In each instance, there are two containers running, with one scraping the data and the other one forwarding it.
    The agent in the `kubelet` component is also in charge of scraping node data and running integrations. The diagram below shows the integration installed in a cluster with three nodes.

    />

    To fetch logs, get the name of the pods you want to retrieve logs from:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE>
    ```

    Retrieve the logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs <POD_NAME> --all-containers --prefix
    ```

    To retrieve logs from the previous execution, add the `--previous` flag. To get logs from only one of the containers, remove the `--all-containers --prefix` flag and specify the container with the `--container` option.

      For the best experience with our Kubernetes integration, we recommend that you use the latest version. Check out [the changes introduced in version 3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/k8s-version2/changes-since-v3).
    </Callout>

    When you use the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains both the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version.

    Once the agent is sending data to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE 'agent' FACET clusterName, containerImage
    ```

    If the agent isn't reporting any data:

    Get the versions of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using `kubectl`:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=newrelic-infrastructure -o jsonpath="{.items..spec..containers..image}"
    ```

    To retrieve the version of `kube-state-metrics` running on your clusters, run the following NRQL query:
