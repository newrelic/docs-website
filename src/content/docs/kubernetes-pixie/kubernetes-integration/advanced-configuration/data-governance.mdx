### Change the scrape interval [#scrape-interval]

The Kubernetes Integration v3 and above allows changing the interval at which metrics are gathered from the cluster. This allows choosing a tradeoff between data resolution and usage. We recommend choosing an interval between 15 and 30 seconds for optimal experience.

In order to change the scrape interval, add the following to your `values-newrelic.yaml`, under the `newrelic-infratructure` section:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    interval: 25s
```

So it ends up looking like:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings as shown above

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings as shown above
  common:
    config:
      interval: 25s
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Setting `interval` to values larger than `40s` is not allowed.
</Callout>

### Filtering Namespaces [#filter-namespace]

The Kubernetes Integration v3 and above allows filtering which namespaces are scraped by labelling them. By default all namespaces are scraped.

We use the `namespaceSelector` in the same way kubernetes does. In order to include only namespaces matching a label, change the `namespaceSelector` by adding the following to your `values-newrelic.yaml`, under the `newrelic-infratructure` section:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        key1 : "value1"
```

In this example only namespaces with the label `newrelic.com/scrape` set to `true` will be scraped:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings as shown above

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings as shown above
  common:
    config:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          newrelic.com/scrape: "true"
```

You can also use kubernetes expressions to include or exclude namespaces using the following syntax:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - {key: newrelic.com/scrape, operator: NotIn, values: ["false"]}
      - {key: key1, operator: In, values: ["value1"]}
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  The expressions under `matchExpressions` are concatenated.
</Callout>

In this example namespaces with the label `newrelic.com/scrape` set to `false` will be excluded:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings as shown above

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings as shown above
  common:
    config:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - {key: newrelic.com/scrape, operator: NotIn, values: ["false"]}
```
