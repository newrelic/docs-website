### Change the scrape interval [#scrape-interval]

The [New Relic Kubernetes integration v3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/changes-since-v3/) and above allows changing the interval at which metrics are gathered from the cluster. This allows choosing a tradeoff between data resolution and usage. We recommend choosing an interval between 15 and 30 seconds for optimal experience.

In order to change the scrape interval, add the following to your `values-newrelic.yaml`, under the `newrelic-infrastructure` section:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    interval: 25s
```

So it ends up looking like:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings
  common:
    config:
      interval: 25s
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Setting `interval` to values larger than `40s` is not allowed.
</Callout>

### Filtering Namespaces [#filter-namespace]

The Kubernetes integration v3 and above allows filtering on which namespaces are scraped by labelling them. All namespaces are scraped by default.

We use the `namespaceSelector` in the same way Kubernetes does. In order to include only namespaces matching a label, change the `namespaceSelector` by adding the following to your `values-newrelic.yaml`, under the `newrelic-infrastructure` section:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        key1 : "value1"
```

In this example only namespaces with the label `newrelic.com/scrape` set to `true` will be scraped:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings 

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings 
  common:
    config:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          newrelic.com/scrape: "true"
```

You can also use Kubernetes expressions to include or exclude namespaces using the following syntax:

```yaml
common:
  config:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - {key: newrelic.com/scrape, operator: NotIn, values: ["false"]}
      - {key: key1, operator: In, values: ["value1"]}
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  The expressions under `matchExpressions` are concatenated.
</Callout>

In this example, namespaces with the label `newrelic.com/scrape` set to `false` will be excluded:

```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
  cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

# ... Other settings 

# Configuration for newrelic-infrastructure
newrelic-infrastructure:
  # ... Other settings
  common:
    config:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - {key: newrelic.com/scrape, operator: NotIn, values: ["false"]}
```

See a full list of settings that can be modified in the [chart's README file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/tree/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure).

#### How can I find out which namespaces are excluded? [#excluded-namespaces]

All the namespaces within the cluster are listed thanks to the `K8sNamespace` sample. The `nrFiltered` attribute determines whether the data related to the namespace is going to be scraped.

Use this query to find out which namespaces are being monitored:

```sql
FROM K8sNamespaceSample SELECT displayName, nrFiltered WHERE clusterName = <clusterName> SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO
```

#### What data is being discarded from the excluded namespaces? [#namespaces-discarded-data]

The following samples won't be available for the excluded namespaces:

- `K8sContainerSample`
- `K8sDaemonsetSample`
- `K8sDeploymentSample`
- `K8sEndpointSample`
- `K8sHpaSample`
- `K8sPodSample`
- `K8sReplicasetSample`
- `K8sServiceSample`
- `K8sStatefulsetSample`
- `K8sVolumeSample`
