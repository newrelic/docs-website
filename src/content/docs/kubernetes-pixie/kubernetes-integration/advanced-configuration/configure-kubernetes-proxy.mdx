If you are running our Kubernetes integration with a proxy, you need to configure each component (the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent), logging and synthetics minion) to correctly work with your proxy.

## Install the infrastructure agent with a proxy [#infrastructure-agent]

The proxy can be configured by setting the `global.proxy` configuration option and configure all the kubernetes integration at the same time. The global configuration is [shared with the dependencies](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle#configure-dependencies) by modifying the `values.yaml` file of the `nri-bundle`:

```yaml
global.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port
```

This will configure all the infrastructure agents, the kubernetes integration, the Metrics Adapter, and the Prometheus OpenMetrics at the same time.

  We do not support Proxy in the Kubernetes infrastructure operator yet.

## Install New Relic Metrics Adapter with a proxy [#metrics-adapter]

  The proxy can be configured by setting the `proxy` configuration option in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter/blob/main/charts/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter/values.yaml) file.
  
  This is used to create the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable in the container.

  The proxy can be configured by setting the `newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.proxy` configuration option. The configuration option is passed to the `newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter` [dependency](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle#configure-dependencies) modifying the `values.yaml` file in `nri-bundle`:

    ```yaml
    newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.proxy: "<a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888</a>
    ```

## Set logging with a proxy [#Logging]

If you're using [log forwarding for the Kubernetes integration](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding), the plugin automatically detects the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, and automatically uses them to set up the proxy configuration. For more information, see [how to customize the proxy, or bypass it](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output#proxy-support).

## Set the synthetics minion to use a proxy [#synthetics]

Check this README [on how to set the proxy](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/synthetics-minion) for the [Synthetics minions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms).
