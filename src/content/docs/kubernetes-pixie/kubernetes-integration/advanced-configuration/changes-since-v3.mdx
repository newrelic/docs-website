From version 3 onwards, the Kubernetes solution of New Relic features an [architecture](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-components/#architecture) which aims to be more modular and configurable, giving you more power to choose how the solution is deployed and making it compatible with more environments.

Data reported by the Kubernetes Integration version 3 hasn't changed since version 2. For version 3, we focused on configurability, stability, and user experience.

<Callout variant="important">
  The Kubernetes integration version 3 (`appVersion`) is included on the `nri-bundle` chart `version` 4.
</Callout>

## Migration Guide [#migration-guide]

To make migration from earlier versions as easy as possible, we have developed a compatibility layer that translates most of the options that could be specified in the old newrelic-infrastructure chart to their new counterparts. This compatibility layer is temporary and will be removed in the future. Therefore, we encourage you to read this guide carefully and migrate the configuration with human supervision.

### Kube State Metrics (KSM) configuration [#ksm-config]

<Callout variant="tip">
  KSM monitoring works out of the box for most configurations, most users will not need to change this config.
</Callout>

* `disableKubeStateMetrics` has been replaced by `ksm.enabled`. The default is still the same (KSM scraping enabled).
* `kubeStateMetricsScheme`, `kubeStateMetricsPort`, `kubeStateMetricsUrl`, `kubeStateMetricsPodLabel`, and `kubeStateMetricsNamespace` have been replaced by the more comprehensive and flexible `ksm.config`.
* Note, KSM v2+ disables labels and annotations metrics by default. You can enable the target labels and annotations metrics to be monitored by using the `metricLabelsAllowlist` and `metricAnnotationsAllowList` options described [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/main/docs/cli-arguments.md) in your Kubernetes clusters.

The `ksm.config` object has the following structure:

```yaml
ksm:
  config:
   # When autodiscovering KSM, force the following scheme. By default, `http` is used.
   scheme: "http"
   # Label selector to find kube-state-metrics endpoints. Defaults to `app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics`.
   selector: "app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics"
   # Restrict KSM discovery to this particular namespace. Defaults to all namespaces.
   namespace: ""
   # When autodiscovering, only consider endpoints that use this port. By default, all ports from the discovered `endpoint` are probed.
   #port: 8080
   # Override autodiscovery mechanism completely and specify the KSM url directly instead
   #staticUrl: "http://test.io:8080/metrics"
```

### Control plane configuration [#controlplane-configuration]

Control plane configuration has changed substantially. If you previously had control plane monitoring enabled, we encourage you to take a look at the [Configure control plane monitoring](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/configure-control-plane-monitoring) dedicated page.

The following options have been replaced by more comprehensive configuration, covered in the section linked above:

* `apiServerSecurePort`
* `etcdTlsSecretName`
* `etcdTlsSecretNamespace`
* `controllerManagerEndpointUrl`, `etcdEndpointUrl`, `apiServerEndpointUrl`, and `schedulerEndpointUrl`

### Agent configuration [#agent-configuration]

Agent config file, previously specified in `config` has been moved to `common.agentConfig`. Format of the file has not changed, and the full range of options that can be configured can be found [here](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/).

The following agent options were previously "aliased" in the root of the `values.yml` file, and are no longer available:

* `logFile` has been replaced by `common.agentConfig.log_file`.
* `eventQueueDepth` has been replaced by `common.agentConfig.event_queue_depth`.
* `customAttributes` has changed in format to a yaml object. The previous format, a manually json-encoded string e.g. `{"team": "devops"}` is deprecated.
* Previously, `customAttributes` had a default `clusterName` entry which might have unwanted consequences if removed. This is no longer the case, users may now safely override `customAttributes` on its entirety.
* `discoveryCacheTTL` has been completely removed, as the discovery is now performed using kubernetes informers which have a built-in cache.

### Integrations configuration [#integrations-configuration]

Integrations were previously configured under `integrations_config`, using an array format:

```yaml
integrations_config:
  - name: nri-redis.yaml
    data:
      discovery:  # ...
      integrations:  # ...
```

The mechanism remains the same, but we have changed the format to be more user-friendly:

```yaml
integrations:
  nri-redis-sampleapp:
    discovery:  # ...
    integrations:  # ...
```

Moreover, now the `--port` and `--tls` flags are mandatory on the discovery command. In the past, the following would work:

```yaml
integrations:
  nri-redis-sampleapp:
    discovery:
      command:
        exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes
```

From v3 onwards, you must specify `--port` and `--tls`:

```yaml
integrations:
  nri-redis-sampleapp:
    discovery:
      command:
        exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --tls --port 10250
```

This change is required because in v2 and below, the `nrk8s-kubelet` component (or its equivalent) ran with `hostNetwork: true`, so `nri-discovery-kubernetes` could connect to the kubelet using `localhost` and plain http. For security reasons, this is no longer the case, hence the need to specify both flags from now on.

For more details on how to configure on-host integrations in Kubernetes please check the [Monitor services in Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes) page.

### Miscellaneous chart values [#misc-chart-values]

While not related to the integration configuration, the following miscellaneous options for the helm chart have also changed:

* `runAsUser` has been replaced by `securityContext`, which is templated directly into the pods and more configurable.
* `resources` has been removed, as now we deploy three different workloads. Resources for each one can be configured individually under:
* `ksm.resources`
* `kubelet.resources`
* `controlPlane.resources`
* Similarly, `tolerations` has been split into three and the previous one is no longer valid:
* `ksm.tolerations`
* `kubelet.tolerations`
* `controlPlane.tolerations`


* All three default to tolerate any value for `NoSchedule` and `NoExecute`


* `image` and all its subkeys have been replaced by individual sections for each of the three images that are now deployed:
* `images.forwarder.*` to configure the infrastructure-agent forwarder.
* `images.agent.*` to configure the image bundling the infrastructure-agent and on-host integrations.
* `images.integration.*` to configure the image in charge of scraping k8s data.

### Upgrade from v2 [#upgrade-from-v2]

In order to upgrade from the Kubernetes integration version 2 (included in [nri-bundle chart](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) versions 3.x), we strongly encourage you to create a `values-newrelic.yaml` file with your desired <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and configuration. If you had previously installed our chart from the CLI directly, for example using a command like the following:

```shell
helm install newrelic/nri-bundle \
--set global.licenseKey=<New Relic License key> \
--set global.cluster=<Cluster name> \
--set infrastructure.enabled=true \
--set prometheus.enabled=true \
--set webhook.enabled=true \
--set ksm.enabled=true \
--set kubeEvents.enabled=true \
--set logging.enabled=true
```

You can take the provided `--set` arguments and put them in a yaml file like the following:

```yaml
# values-newrelic.yaml
global:
  licenseKey: <New Relic License key>
  cluster: <Cluster name>
infrastructure:
  enabled: true
prometheus:
  enabled: true
webhook:
  enabled: true
ksm:
  enabled: true
kubeEvents:
  enabled: true
logging:
  enabled: true
```

After doing this, and adapting any other setting you might have changed according to the [section above](#migration-guide), you can upgrade by running the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \
--namespace newrelic --create-namespace \
-f values-newrelic.yaml
```

<Callout variant="important">
  The `--reuse-values` flag is not supported for upgrading from v2 to v3.
</Callout>
