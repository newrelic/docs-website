## Problem [#problem]

You are getting error messages for the [New Relic Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration) from your terminal during the Kubernetes integration installation or in your New Relic infrastructure logs after the Kubernetes integration installation.

    If you see the following error message during your manual Kubernetes intergration installation:

    ```shell
    repo newrelic not found
    ```

    You may have forgotten or skipped this command for adding the newrelic repo to your helm chart:

    ```shell
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

  <Collapser
    id="invalid-license"
    title="Invalid New Relic license"
  >
    If the license you are using is invalid then you will see an error like this in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

    ```shell
    2018-04-09T14:20:17.750893186Z time="2018-04-09T14:20:17Z" level=error 
    msg="metric sender can't process 0 times" error="InventoryIngest: events
     were not accepted: 401 401 Unauthorized Invalid license key."
    ```

    To resolve this problem make sure you specify a valid <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>.

    If the agent is not able to connect to New Relic servers you will see an error like the following in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

    ```shell
    2018-04-09T18:16:35.497195185Z time="2018-04-09T18:16:35Z" level=error 
    msg="metric sender can't process 1 times" error="Error sending events: 
    Post https://staging-infra-api.newrelic.com/metrics/events/bulk: 
    net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)"
    ```

    Depending on the exact nature of the error the message in the logs may differ.

    To address this problem, see the [New Relic networks documentation](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks#infrastructure).

  <Collapser
    id="unable-find-kube-state-metrics"
    title="Failed to discover kube-state-metrics"
  >
    The Kubernetes integration requires `kube-state-metrics`. If this is missing, you'll see an error like the following in the `newrelic-infra` container logs:

    ```shell
    time="2022-06-21T09:12:20Z" level=error msg="retrieving scraper data: retrieving ksm data: discovering KSM endpoints: timeout discovering endpoints"
    ```

    Common reasons for this error include:

    * `kube-state-metrics` has not been deployed into the cluster.
    * `kube-state-metrics` is deployed using a custom deployment.
    * There are multiple versions of `kube-state-metrics` running and the Kubernetes integration is not finding the correct one.

    The Kubernetes integration automatically discovers `kube-state-metrics` in your cluster using by default leveraging the label `"app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics"` across all namespaces.

    You can change the discovery behavior in the `ksm.config` of the helm [chart values](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure/values.yaml).

  <Collapser
    id="tcp-timeout"
    title="Unable to connect to the server"

    During the guided install, an output error like the one below indicates that you are experiencing a networking connection issue between the Kubernetes client and Kubernetes API server. Please make sure your Kubernetes client can connect to your Kubernetes API server before you run the guided install again.

    ```shell
    Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp [7777:777:7777:7777:77::77]:443: i/o timeout
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="pod-not-starting"
    title="Pod is not starting"
  >
    During the guided install, an output error, like `nrk8s-kubelet pod is not starting`, indicates that the Kubernetes kubelet pod cannot be started within 5 minutes and the installation script exits due to this timeout.
    In this case, you can run `kubectl get pods -o wide -n newrelic | grep nrk8s-kubelet` to see the pod's status and restarts.

    * If the pod is in `ImagePullBackOff` status, please check you network connection to allow image pulling from the domains listed [here](/install/kubernetes).
    * If the pod is in `Pending` or `ContainerCreating` status, please use `kubectl logs newrelic-bundle-nrk8s-kubelet-***<DNT>** -n newrelic` and `kubectl logs newrelic-bundle-nrk8s-kubelet-**</DNT>*** -n newrelic -c kubelet` to figure out the potential reasons from the logs.

  <Collapser

    title="Installation error due to Dockerhub and registry.k8s.io"
  >
    If you have a problem with the [New Relic dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/newrelic) and Google's [`registry.k8s.io`](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io) during the installation, check you've added their domains to your allow list. The installation pulls the container images from this location. You may need to follow the [commands](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/#how-can-i-check-if-i-am-impacted) to find the extra Google registry domains to add to your whitelist. `registry.k8s.io` usually redirects to your local registry domain. For example, `asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev` based on your region.
