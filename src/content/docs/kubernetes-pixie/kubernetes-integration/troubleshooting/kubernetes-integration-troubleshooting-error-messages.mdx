## Problem

You are getting error messages for the [New Relic Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration) from your terminal during the Kubernetes integration installation or in your New Relic infrastructure logs after the Kubernetes integration installation.

    If you see the following error message during your manual Kubernetes intergration installation:

    ```
    repo newrelic not found
    ```

    You may have forgotten or skipped this command for adding the newrelic repo to your helm chart:

    ```
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

    If the license you are using is invalid then you will see an error like this in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

    ```
    2018-04-09T14:20:17.750893186Z time="2018-04-09T14:20:17Z" level=error 
    msg="metric sender can't process 0 times" error="InventoryIngest: events
     were not accepted: 401 401 Unauthorized Invalid license key."
    ```

    To resolve this problem make sure you specify a valid <LicenseKey/>.

    If the agent is not able to connect to New Relic servers you will see an error like the following in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

    ```
    2018-04-09T18:16:35.497195185Z time="2018-04-09T18:16:35Z" level=error

    Post https://staging-infra-api.newrelic.com/metrics/events/bulk: 
    net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)"
    ```

    Depending on the exact nature of the error the message in the logs may differ.

    To address this problem, see the [New Relic networks documentation](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks#infrastructure).

  <Collapser
    id="unable-find-kube-state-metrics"
    title="Failed to discover kube-state-metrics"
  >
    The Kubernetes integration requires `kube-state-metrics`. If that is not found, you will see an error like the following in the newrelic-infra container logs:

    ```
    time="2022-06-21T09:12:20Z" level=error msg="retrieving scraper data: retrieving ksm data: discovering KSM endpoints: timeout discovering endpoints"
    ```

    Common reasons for this error include:

    * `kube-state-metrics` has not been deployed into the cluster.
    * `kube-state-metrics` is deployed using a custom deployment.
    * There are multiple versions of `kube-state-metrics` running and the Kubernetes integration is not finding the correct one.

    The Kubernetes integration automatically discovers `kube-state-metrics` in your cluster using by default legeraging the label `"app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics"` across all namespaces.

    You can change the discovery behavior in the `ksm.config` of the helm [chart values](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/charts/newrelic-infrastructure/values.yaml).

## Solution for integration version v2

Below are some solutions to the most common Kubernetes integration errors. These errors show up in the standard non-verbose Infrastructure agent logs.

If you need more detailed logs working with New Relic support, for example, see [Kubernetes logs](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/get-logs-version/).

<CollapserGroup>

    id="unable-find-kube-state-metrics-v2"
    title="Failed to discover kube-state-metrics"
  >
    The Kubernetes integration requires `kube-state-metrics`. If that is not found, you will see an error like the following in the newrelic-infra container logs:

    ```
    2018-04-11T08:02:41.765236022Z time="2018-04-11T08:02:41Z" level=error 
    msg="executing data source" data prefix="integration/com.newrelic.kubernetes" 
    error="exit status 1" plugin name=nri-kubernetes stderr="time=\"2018-04-11T08:02:41Z\" 
    level=fatal msg=\"failed to discover kube-state-metrics endpoint, 
    got error: no service found by label k8s-app=kube-state-metrics\"\n"
    ```

    Common reasons for this error include:

    * `kube-state-metrics` has not been deployed into the cluster.
    * `kube-state-metrics` is deployed using a custom deployment.
    * There are multiple versions of `kube-state-metrics` running and the Kubernetes integration is not finding the correct one.

    The Kubernetes integration automatically discovers `kube-state-metrics` in your cluster using this logic:

    1. It looks for a `kube-state-metrics` service running on the `kube-system` namespace.
    2. If that is not found, it looks for a service tagged with label `"k8s-app: kube-state-metrics"`.

    The integration also requires the kube-state-metrics pod to have the label `k8s-app: kube-state-metrics` or `app: kube-state-metrics`. If neither of those are found, there will be a log entry like the following:

    ```
    2018-04-11T09:25:00.825532798Z time="2018-04-11T09:25:00Z" level=error 
    msg="executing data source" data prefix="integration/com.newrelic.kubernetes" 
    error="exit status 1" plugin name=nri-kubernetes stderr="time=\"2018-04-11T09:25:00Z\" 
    level=fatal msg=\"failed to discover nodeIP with kube-state-metrics, 
    got error: no pod found by label k8s-app=kube-state-metrics\"\n
    ```

    To solve this issue, add the `k8s-app=kube-state-metrics` label to the `kube-state-metrics` pod.

    id="metrics-missing"
    title="Missing metrics for Namespaces, Deployments, and ReplicaSets"
  >
    If metrics for Kubernetes nodes, pods, and containers are showing but metrics for namespaces, deployments and `ReplicaSets` are missing, the Kubernetes integration is not able to connect to `kube-state-metrics`.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="indicators"
        title="Indicators of missing data"
      >
        Indicators of missing namespace, deployment, and `ReplicaSet` data:

        * In the **# of K8s objects** chart, that data is missing.
        * Queries for `K8sNamespaceSample`, `K8sDeploymentSample`, and `K8sReplicasetSample` don't show any data.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    There are few possible reasons for this:

    1. `kube-state-metrics` service has been customized to listen on port 80. If that is the case, you may see an error like the following in the `verbose` logs:

       ```
       time="2018-04-04T09:35:47Z" level=error msg="executing data source" 
       data prefix="integration/com.newrelic.kubernetes" error="exit status 1" 
       plugin name=nri-kubernetes stderr="time=\"2018-04-04T09:35:47Z\" 
       level=fatal msg=\"Non-recoverable error group: error querying KSM. 
       Get http://kube-state-metrics.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:0/metrics: 
       net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\"\n"
       ```

       This is a known problem that happens in some clusters where it takes too much time for `kube-state-metrics` to collect all the cluster's information before sending to the integration.

       As a workaround, [increase the kube-state-metrics client timeout](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#kube-state-metrics-timeout-change).
    2. `kube-state-metrics` instance is running behind kube-rbac-proxy. New Relic does not currently support this configuration. You may see an error like the following in the `verbose` logs:

       ```
       time="2018-03-28T23:09:12Z" level=error msg="executing data source" 
       data prefix="integration/com.newrelic.kubernetes" error="exit status 1" 
       plugin name=nri-kubernetes stderr="time=\"2018-03-28T23:09:12Z\" 
       level=fatal msg=\"Non-recoverable error group: error querying KSM. 
       Get http://192.168.132.37:8443/metrics: net/http: HTTP/1.x 
       transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response \\\"\\\\x15\\\\x03\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x02\\\\x02\\\"\"\n"
       ```
    3. The KSM payload is quite large, and the Kubernetes integration processing the date is being OOM-killed. Since the integration is not the main process of the container, the pod is not restarted. This situation can be spotted at the logs of the `newrelic-infra` pod running in the same node of KSM:

       ```
       time="2020-12-10T17:40:44Z" level=error msg="Integration command failed" error="signal: killed" instance=nri-kubernetes integration=com.newrelic.kubernetes
       ```

       As a workaround, increase the DaemonSet memory limits so the process is not killed.

    title="Cannot list pods at the cluster scope"
  >
    Newrelic pods and newrelic service account are not deployed in the same namespace. This is usually because the current context specifies a namespace. If this is the case, you will see an error like the following:

    ```
    time=\"2018-05-31T10:55:39Z\" level=panic msg=\"p
    ods is forbidden: User \\\"system:serviceaccount:kube-system:newrelic\\\" cannot list pods at the cluster scope\"
    ```

    To check to see if this is the case, run:

    ```
    kubectl describe serviceaccount newrelic | grep Namespace
    kubectl get pods -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    To resolve this problem, change the namespace for the service account in the New Relic `DaemonSet` YAML file to be the same as the namespace for the current context:

    ```
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: newrelic
      namespace: default
    ---
    ```
