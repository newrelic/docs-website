To generate verbose logs and get version and configuration information, follow these procedures.

    For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent adds a log entry only in the event of an error. Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you are doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Verbose mode significantly increases the amount of info sent to log files. Temporarily enable this mode only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished.
    </Callout>

    To get verbose logging details for an integration using a manifest file:

    1. Enable `verbose` logging: In the deployment file, set the value of `NRIA_VERBOSE` to `1`.
    2. Apply the modified configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f <var>your_newrelic_k8s</var>.yaml
       ```
    3. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until you feel enough activity has occurred.
    4. Disable verbose mode: Set the `NRIA_VERBOSE` value back to `0`.
    5. Apply the restored configuration by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply -f <var>your_newrelic_k8s</var>.yaml
       ```
    6. Get a list of nodes in the environment:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces
       ```
    7. Get a list of infrastructure and kube-state-metrics pods:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | egrep 'newrelic|kube-state-metrics'
       ```
    8. [Get logs from the pods connecting to kube-state-metrics](#logs-pod-kubestatemetrics).
    9. [Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration](#kube-state-metrics-version).

    To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm:

    1. Enable verbose logging:
       ```shell
       helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle
       ```
    2. Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred.
    3. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging:
       ```shell
       helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-infrastructure.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle
       ```
    4. Follow the steps to restore your configuration from step 5 in the section, [Get verbose logs for installations using a manifest file](#verbose-with-manifest).

      To have the best experience with our Kubernetes integration, we advice you to be on the last version of our integration. Check [what changes got introduced with version 3](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3).
    </Callout>

    For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version.

    When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE 'agent' FACET clusterName, containerImage
    ```

    If the agent isn't reporting any data:

    1. Get the versions of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using `kubectl`:
       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath="{.items..spec..containers..image}"
       ```
    2. Look for output similar to this:
       ```shell
       newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0
       ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="kube-state-metrics-version"

    To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage
    ```

    To get the logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics:

    1. Get the nodes that kube-state-metrics is running on:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       kube-system   kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh     2/2
       Running   4          4d        172.17.0.3   minikube
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on the same node as kube-state-metrics:

       ```shell
       kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       default                    newrelic-infra-5wcv6                     100m (5%)
       0 (0%)      100Mi (5%)       100Mi (5%)
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6
       ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

    To retrieve the configuration:

    1. Run:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep "kube-state-metrics"
       ```
    2. Look for a response similar to this:

       ```shell
       kube-system   kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m     2/2
       Running       8          6d
       ```
    3. Review the namespace in the first column.

       ```shell
       kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <var><namespace></var>
       ```

    To get the logs from a pod running on a master node:

    1. Get the nodes that are labelled as master:

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""
       ```

       Or,

       ```shell
       kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role="master"
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       NAME                         STATUS  ROLES   AGE   VERSION
       ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal   Ready   master  42d   v1.14.8
       ```
    2. Get the New Relic pods that are running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step:

       ```shell
       kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces
       ```

       Look for output similar to this:

       ```shell
       newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
    3. Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running:

       ```shell
       kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt
       ```
