## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for New Relic's Kubernetes integration and the cluster shows up in your New Relic account, but some or all nodes are missing.

## Solution

If you [deployed the infrastructure agent](#install) and completed the [Kubernetes installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) but not all nodes show up, complete these steps:

1. Confirm that the infrastructure agent can be scheduled on every node by running:

   ```
   kubectl describe daemonset newrelic-infra
   ```
2. Confirm that the time on all nodes is accurate. Nodes that are more than 2 minutes ahead or behind will not show up in the Cluster explorer. The following NRQL query can be used to check if this is the case:

   ```
   FROM K8sNodeSample SELECT latest(nr.ingestTimeMs - timestamp) / 1000 AS 'Clock offset seconds' FACET nodeName LIMIT max SINCE 1 DAY AGO
   ```
3. [Retrieve the logs from the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/get-logs-version) on the nodes that do not appear in the cluster explorer and confirm there are no [error messages](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/troubleshooting/kubernetes-integration-troubleshooting-error-messages).
