If you have both Istio and the New Relic Kubernetes integration installed and enabled in your environment, issues may arise.
This page describes one issue with Istio when the New Relic Kubernetes integration is installed.

    When Istio is enabled in customer clusters, the Istio-deployed Envoy proxies have a Prometheus metric endpoint that exposes Prometheus metrics.

    These metrics are associated with a dedicated `cluster_name` as `xds-grpc`. If you also enable the Prometheus agent in New Relic Kubernetes integration, the agent will collect these Envoy-related metrics with `cluster_name` as `xds_grpc` in addition to the metrics with `cluster_name` defined through `global.cluster`.

    Run the following query to get a full list of Envoy proxy metrics:

    ```
    FROM `Metric`
    SELECT uniques(metricName)
    WHERE cluster_name = 'xds-grpc' SINCE 1 week ago
    ```

    When Istio is enabled in the newrelic namespace, the newrelic Kubernetes integration pods inside the namespace may encounter networking issues and they may not even be created due to lack of network connectivity.
    
    For example, when you see the following error message during Kubernetes integratoin installation, it means you may have Istio enabled in the newrelic namespace and the required secret `newrelic-bundle-nri-metadata-injection-admission` is failed to be created due to networking connectivity issues.
