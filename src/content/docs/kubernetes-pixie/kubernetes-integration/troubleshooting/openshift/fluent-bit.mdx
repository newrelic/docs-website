## Problem
You are getting errors like `cannot increase buffer: current=32000 requested=64768 max=32000` or `pod out of memory`. 
## Solution
Add `k8sBufferSize` attribute to increase the buffer size of the fluent bit.
```yaml
newrelic-logging:
  enabled: true
  containerSecurityContext:
    privileged: true
  fluentBit:
    k8sBufferSize: "64k"
    persistence:
      mode: "none"
```
