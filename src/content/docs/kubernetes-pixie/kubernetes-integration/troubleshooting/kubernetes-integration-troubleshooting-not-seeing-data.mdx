## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for New Relic's Kubernetes integration but are not seeing Kubernetes data in your New Relic account.

## Solution

If you have [deployed the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/#install) and completed the [Kubernetes installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) but are not seeing any information in the Kubernetes dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Check if you've access to this feature. See [Factors affecting access to features and data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
2. Confirm you have configured the `CLUSTER_NAME` and `NRI_LICENSE_KEY` variables in the deployment file before running it. See the [installation procedures](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for more information.
3. Confirm the deployment was successful by running:
  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep newrelic
  ```
4. [Retrieve the logs from the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/get-logs-version) and ensure there are no [error messages](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/troubleshooting/kubernetes-integration-troubleshooting-error-messages).
