## Problem

You are getting the message `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.

## Solution

You need to ensure your signed certificates are properly configured. To do so, you can add the following environment variables in the agent YML container:

```yml
- name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR 
  value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR
- name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE  
  value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME
```
