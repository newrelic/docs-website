## Problem

You get this output error when you're following the guided install.

  ```shell
    Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp [7777:777:7777:7777:77::77]:443: i/o timeout
  ```

## Solution

This indicates that you're experiencing a network connection issue between the Kubernetes client and the Kubernetes API server. Make sure your Kubernetes client can connect to your Kubernetes API server before running the guided install again.
