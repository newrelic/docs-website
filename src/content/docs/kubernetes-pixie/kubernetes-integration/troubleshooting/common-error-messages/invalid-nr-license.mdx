## Problem

You are getting this error in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

  ```shell
    2018-04-09T14:20:17.750893186Z time="2018-04-09T14:20:17Z" level=error 
    msg="metric sender can't process 0 times" error="InventoryIngest: events
    were not accepted: 401 401 Unauthorized Invalid license key."
  ```

## Solution

Make sure you're using a valid <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>.
