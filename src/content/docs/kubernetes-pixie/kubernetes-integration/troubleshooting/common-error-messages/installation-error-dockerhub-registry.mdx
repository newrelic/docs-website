## Problem

You have a problem with the [New Relic dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/newrelic) and Google's [`registry.k8s.io`](https://github.com/kubernetes/registry.k8s.io) during the installation.


## Solution

Check you've added their domains to your allow list. The installation pulls the container images from this location. You can [test connectivity to `registry.k8s.io`](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/#how-can-i-check-if-i-am-impacted) to find the extra Google registry domains to add to your whitelist. `registry.k8s.io` usually redirects to your local registry domain. For example, `asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev` based on your region.
