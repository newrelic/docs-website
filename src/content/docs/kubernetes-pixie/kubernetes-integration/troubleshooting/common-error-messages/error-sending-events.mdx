## Problem

The agent can't connect to the New Relic servers and you see an error like the following in the logs of the `agent` or `forwarder` containers:

    ```shell
    2018-04-09T18:16:35.497195185Z time="2018-04-09T18:16:35Z" level=error 
    msg="metric sender can't process 1 times" error="Error sending events: 
    Post https://api.newrelic.com/metrics/events/bulk: 
    net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)"
    ```

## Solution

Depending on the exact nature of the error the message in the logs may differ. To address this problem, see the [New Relic networks documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#infrastructure) and the [Troubleshooting New Relic infrastructure agent networking issue](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/docs/network_troubleshooting.md?) GitHub page.
