---

The [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) is compatible with many different platforms including GKE, EKS, AKS, OpenShift, and more. Each has a different compatibility with our integration. You can find more information in this page.

## Requirements [#reqs]

The New Relic Kubernetes integration requires a New Relic account. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.
<InlineSignup/>

You'll also need: 
* A Linux distribution [compatible with New Relic infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).
* If you are using Helm, see the specific [compatibility and requirements](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#compatibility). 

<Callout variant="important">
  `kube-state-metrics` v2 or higher is supported from integration version 3.6.0 or higher.
  <br/>Install the Kubernetes integration up to version 3.5.0 if you are using `kube-state-metrics` 1.9.8 or lower.
  <br/>
  Check the `values.yaml` file if you're updating `kube-state-metrics` from v1.9.8 to v2 or higher because some variables may have changed.
</Callout>

## Container runtime [#containers]

Our Kubernetes integration is [CRI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri)-agnostic. It's been specifically tested to be compatible with Containerd, CRI-O, and Docker.

## Compatibility [#compatibility]

Our Kubernetes integration is compatible with Kubernetes versions 1.16 to 1.26.

<Callout variant="important">
If you are using Openshift, you can also use `kubectl` most of the time but be careful that `kubectl` does not have commands like `oc login` or `oc adm`. You may need to use `oc` instead of `kubectl`.
</Callout>

Our Kubernetes is compatible and is continuously tested on the following versions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
      </th>
      <th>
        Versions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Kubernetes cluster
      </td>
      <td>
        1.16 to 1.26
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="important">
        Starting from Kubernetes version 1.26, the `@autoscaling/v2beta2` API is no longer available and replaced by the `@autoscaling/v2`. For continued `HorizontalPodAutoscaling` metric reporting it's important that you install `kube-state-metrics` version 2.7+ on the Kubernetes version 1.26+ clusters. This is because only `kube-state-metrics` v2.7+ can support the `@autoscaling/v2` API.
        </Callout>

### Kubernetes Flavors

Kubernetes integration is compatible with different flavors. We tested the integration with the following ones:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Flavor
      </th>
      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

Depending on the installation method, the [control plane monitoring](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring) is not available or may need extra configuration.

For example:

* Only API Server metrics are scrapable and available to instrument managed clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS) control plane because no endpoint exposes the needed metrics for etcd, scheduler and controller manager.
* To instrument Rancher control plane, since components `/metrics` are not always reachable by default and can't be autodiscovered, some [extra configuration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#rancher) is needed.
