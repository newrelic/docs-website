[New Relic's Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) can be [installed directly](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install) on a server or VM, or through several [cloud platforms](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#cloud-platforms), such as GKE, EKS, AKS, or OpenShift. Each has a different compatibility with our integration.

<Callout variant="important">
If you are using Openshift, you can also use `kubectl` most of the time but be careful that `kubectl` does not have commands like `oc login` or `oc adm`. You may need to use `oc` instead of `kubectl`.
</Callout>

## Compatibility [#compatibility]

Our Kubernetes is compatible and is continuously tested on the following versions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
      </th>
      <th>
        Versions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Kubernetes cluster
      </td>
      <td>
        1.16 to 1.24
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Kubernetes Flavors

New Relic's Kubernetes integration is compatible with different flavors. We tested the integration with the following ones:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Flavor
      </th>
      <th>
        Notes
      </th>

</table>

Depending on the installation method, the [control plane monitoring](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring) is not available or may need extra configuration.

For example:

* Only API Server metrics are scrapable and available to instrument managed clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS) control plane because no endpoint exposes the needed metrics for etcd, Scheduler and Controller manager.
* To instrument Rancher control plane, since components `/metrics` are not always reachable by default and can't be autodiscovered, some [extra configuration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#rancher) is needed.

## Requirements [#reqs]

The New Relic Kubernetes integration has the following requirements:

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free](https://newrelic.com/signup). No credit card required.
* Linux distribution [compatible with New Relic infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).
* [`kube-state-metrics` version 1.9.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) running on the cluster.
* When using CRI-O as the container runtime, the [processes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=ProcessSample) inside containers are not reported. Performance data is collected at the [container](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/find-use-your-kubernetes-data#container-data) level.

## Container information [#containers]

Our Kubernetes integration is [CRI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri)-agnostic. It's been specifically tested to be compatible with Containerd, CRI-O, and Docker.

## Install using Helm [#helm-install]

For instructions about how to install our integration using Helm, see [Manual install using Helm](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm#h2-compatibility-and-requirements).
