The [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) is compatible with many different platforms including GKE, EKS, AKS, OpenShift, and more. Each has a different compatibility with our integration. You can find more information in this page.

## Requirements [#reqs]

The New Relic Kubernetes integration requires a New Relic account. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.

You'll also need a Linux distribution [compatible with New Relic infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).

<Callout variant="important">
  * `kube-state-metrics` v2 or higher is supported from integration version 3.6.0 or higher.

  * Install the Kubernetes integration up to version 3.5.0 if you're using `kube-state-metrics` 1.9.8 or lower.

  * Check the `values.yaml` file if you're updating `kube-state-metrics` from v1.9.8 to v2 or higher because some variables may have changed.
</Callout>

### Compatibility and requirements for Helm [#req-helm]

* Make sure you've [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm?tab=readme-ov-file#install) is installed and that the minimum supported version is v3. Version 3 of the Kubernetes integration requires Helm version 3.

* Choose a display name for your cluster. For example, you could use this output:

  ```shell
  kubectl config current-context
  ```

### Compatibility and requirements for Manifest [#req-manifest]

If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, you will need to first remove the old installation using `kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml`, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using `kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml`.

## Container runtime [#containers]

Our Kubernetes integration is [CRI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri)-agnostic. It's been specifically tested to be compatible with Containerd. Note that Dockershim has been removed from the Kubernetes project as of release 1.24. Read the [Dockershim Removal FAQ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/) for further details.

## Compatibility [#compatibility]

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are using Openshift, you can also use `kubectl` most of the time but be careful that `kubectl` does not have commands like `oc login` or `oc adm`. You may need to use `oc` instead of `kubectl`.
</Callout>

Our integration is compatible and is continuously tested on the following Kubernetes versions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}/>

      <th>
        Versions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Kubernetes cluster
      </td>

      <td>
        1.26 to 1.30
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="important">
  Starting from Kubernetes version 1.26, `@autoscaling/v2` has replaced the `@autoscaling/v2beta2` API. For continued `HorizontalPodAutoscaling` metric reporting, you must install `kube-state-metrics` version 2.7+ on the Kubernetes version 1.26+ clusters, because only `kube-state-metrics` v2.7+ can support the `@autoscaling/v2` API.
</Callout>

### Kubernetes Flavors

Kubernetes integration is compatible with different flavors. We tested the integration with the following ones:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Flavor
      </th>

      <th>
        Notes
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Depending on the installation method, the [control plane monitoring](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring) is not available or may need extra configuration.

For example:

* Only API Server metrics are scrapable and available to instrument managed clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS) control plane because no endpoint exposes the needed metrics for etcd, scheduler and controller manager.
* To instrument Rancher control plane, since components `/metrics` are not always reachable by default and can't be autodiscovered, some [extra configuration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#rancher) is needed.
