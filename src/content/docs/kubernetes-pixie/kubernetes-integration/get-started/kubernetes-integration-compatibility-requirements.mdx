[New Relic's Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) can be [installed directly](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install) on a server or VM, or through several [cloud platforms](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#cloud-platforms), such as GKE, EKS, AKS, or OpenShift. Each has a different compatibility with our integration.

## Compatibility

<Callout title="EOL NOTICE">
  We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in December 2021, including Kubernetes instrumentation support for versions v1.10 to v1.15. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-node-agents-suggested-pagerduty-responders-incident-workflows-and-kubernetes-instrumentation/164481?u=dholloran).
</Callout>

Our Kubernetes integration is compatible with the following versions, depending on the installation mode:

## Requirements

The New Relic Kubernetes integration has the following requirements:

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free](https://newrelic.com/signup). No credit card required.
* Linux distribution [compatible with New Relic infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).
* [`kube-state-metrics` version 1.9.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) running on the cluster.
* When using CRI-O as the container runtime, the [processes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=ProcessSample) inside containers are not reported. Performance data is collected at the [container](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/find-use-your-kubernetes-data#container-data) level.

## Install using Helm [#helm-install]

For detailed instructions about how to install our integration using Helm, see [Manual install using Helm](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm#h2-compatibility-and-requirements).
