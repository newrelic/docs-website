Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The New Relic Kubernetes monitoring integration gives you visibility into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads in minutes, whether your clusters are hosted on-premises or in the cloud.

Thanks to our [cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod.

You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the [cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualised according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. [Predefined alert conditions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy) help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing.

You'll be able to configure Kubernetes to suit your environment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and [install our Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/).

## Why it matters [#features]

Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments.

In New Relic, you can build your own charts and [query](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) all your [Kubernetes data](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/find-use-your-kubernetes-data), which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers.

With the Kubernetes integration you can also:

* [Link your APM data to Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes) to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability.
* [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes), such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our [tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/tutorial-monitor-redis-running-kubernetes)).
* Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the [predefined alert conditions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy).
* Navigate all your Kubernetes events. The [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration), which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the **Kubernetes events** box in step 3 of [our install wizard](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install-wizard), or follow [these instructions](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration#install).

These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for [containerized processes running on instrumented hosts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure).

## Bring your cluster logs to New Relic [#k8s-logs]

Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the **Log data** box in step 3 of [our install wizard](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#install-wizard). For detailed information, see our [log forwarding documentation](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/) for Kubernetes.

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes) and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-kubernetes/blob/main/README.md).
