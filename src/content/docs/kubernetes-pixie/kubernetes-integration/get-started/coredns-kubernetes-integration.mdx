Our coreDNS integration monitors the performance of your coreDNS data, helping you diagnose issues in your DNS requests, responses and cache. Our coreDNS integration gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important coreDNS metrics.

<Steps>
  <Step>

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To use the CoreDNS integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with CoreDNS-specific data such as database and instance metrics.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Install the Kubernetes agent [#kubernetes]

The guided installation experience streamlines the process for integrating New Relic with CoreDNS on Kubernetes, allowing you to select which features to enable and what data to collect. Use New Relic to visualize CoreDNS performance, set up alerts for potential issues, and troubleshoot errors. CoreDNS is a crucial component of Kubernetes clusters, and with New Relic, you can monitor:

- Your system health
- CoreDNS latency
- CoreDNS errors
- Cache stats

To install the Kubernetes agent, please refer to the following [Kubernetes installation document](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/).
    </Step>

## Find your data [#find-your-data]

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named CoreDNS to monitor your CoreDNS metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), go to the **+ Add data** page.
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type **CoreDNS (Kubernetes)**.
4. The CoreDNS dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your CoreDNS dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the Dashboards UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).


Here is a NRQL query to check the CoreDNS list of metrics:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE 'coredns_%'  LIMIT MAX
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
