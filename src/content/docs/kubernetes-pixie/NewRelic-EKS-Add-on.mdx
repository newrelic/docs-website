Using New Relic EKS add-on we can Monitor EKS Cluster.

## Install NewRelic Over EKS add-ons.

1. **Set up an AWS EKS Cluster:**

   If you don't already have an EKS cluster, you'll need to set one up. This typically involves creating the EKS cluster, configuring nodes, and ensuring that the necessary IAM permissions are in place.

2. **Sign in to the NewRelic:**

   Log in to your NewRelic environment or sign up for a NewRelic account if you haven't already.

3. **Create an LICENSE KEY:**

   In NewRelic, Create an LICENSE Key, that will be used to authenticate and authorize the NewRelic Operator to send monitoring data to your NewRelic environment.

4. **Install NewRelic Operator on EKS Cluster:**

   You need to install the NewRelic Operator. For that click on **Add-ons tab**. Find NewRelic Operator from list of providers & click on install.

5. **Apply CRD's On EKS Cluster:**
   - Clone K8S Operator Repository & Apply the CRD's with below commands :
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-k8s-operator.git
   kubectl apply -f config/samples/newrelic_v1alpha1_newrelic.yaml
   kubectl apply -f config/samples/minimal_nribundle.yaml
   ```

6. **Validate Monitoring Data:**

   After configuration, NewRelic Operator will start collecting and displaying monitoring data for your EKS cluster.

7. **You're good to go!**
