While the New Relic Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to be robust and reliable, issues can still arise. This troubleshooting document provides troubleshooting steps for common problems you might encounter.


## General Collector Pod Issues [#general-collector-pod-issues]

Check out the logs of the Collector pod that's experiencing issues. Run this command:

```shell
  kubectl logs <otel-pod-name> -n newrelic
```

To enable detailed `DEBUG` level logging for troubleshooting, set the `verboseLog` parameter to `true` in the [`nr-k8s-otel-collector`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector#values) Helm chart.

## Metric collection failures [#metric-collection-failures]

**Problem:** Metrics are not being collected or sent to New Relic.

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Verify scrape configurations:** Ensure your `prometheus` receiver configurations within the collector's configuration (`extraConfig` or `default`) are correct.

  ```shell
    kubectl describe configmap prometheus-config -n monitoring
  ```

* **Check pod annotations:** If you're using Prometheus service discovery, confirm that your application pods have the correct `prometheus.io/scrape=true` annotations.

  ```shell
    kubectl get pods --namespace=[your-namespace] --show-labels | grep 'prometheus.io/scrape=true'
  ```

* **Test network connectivity:** Ensure the collector pod can reach the metric endpoints.

  ```shell
    kubectl exec [prometheus-pod-name] -- curl <http://service:port>
  ```

## Configuration overrides not taking effect [#configuration-overrides-not-taking-effect]

**Problem:** Custom configurations are not properly applied.

**troubleshooting:**

* **Review your `values.yaml`:** Double-check your `values.yaml` file for typos or incorrect indentation in the `extraConfig` section.

  ```shell
    cat helm-charts/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector/values.yaml | grep extraConfig
  ```

* **Validate applied `ConfigMaps`:** The Helm chart generates `ConfigMaps` from your `values.yaml`. Inspect the resulting `ConfigMap` to ensure your custom settings are present.

  ```shell
    kubectl describe configmap [collector-configmap-name] -n monitoring
  ```

## Collector failing to start [#collector-failing-to-start]

**Problem:** The OpenTelemetry collector pod fails to initialize or crashes repeatedly.

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Inspect pod logs:** The most common first step. Look for specific error messages that indicate misconfigurations or missing dependencies.

  ```shell
    kubectl logs [collector-pod-name] --namespace=monitoring
  ```

* **Verify environment variables:** Ensure required environment variables are correctly injected.

  ```shell
    kubectl exec [collector-pod-name] -- env | grep -i [variable-name]
  ```

## Network failures [#network-failures]

**Problem:** The collector cannot communicate or send data to New Relic. 

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Check DNS resolution:** Ensure the collector pod can resolve service names or New Relic endpoints.

  ```shell
    kubectl exec [collector-pod-name] -- nslookup service-name
  ```

* Run connectivity tests: Test connectivity to internal services or external New Relic endpoints.

  ```shell
    kubectl exec [collector-pod-name] -- curl -I <http://service-name:port>
  ```
* Review network policies: If you have strict network policies in your cluster, ensure they allow traffic for the OpenTelemetry Collector pods to internal services and external New Relic endpoints.

  ```shell
    kubectl describe networkpolicy -n [namespace]
  ```
