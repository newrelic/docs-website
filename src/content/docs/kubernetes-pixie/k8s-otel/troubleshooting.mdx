While the New Relic Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to be robust and reliable, issues can still arise. This troubleshooting document provides troubleshooting steps for common problems you might encounter.


Check out the logs of the Collector pod that's experiencing issues. Run this command:

```shell
    kubectl logs <otel-pod-name> -n newrelic
```

You can also set the `verboseLog` parameter to `true` in the [`nr-k8s-otel-collector`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector#values) Helm chart.
