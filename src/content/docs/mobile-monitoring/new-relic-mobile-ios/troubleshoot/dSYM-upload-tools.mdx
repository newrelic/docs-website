## Problem

When integrating the New Relic iOS agent using Swift Package Manager (SPM) in Xcode 15.3 or later, the `run-symbol-tool` may fail to upload dSYMs automatically. This is caused by an Xcode build setting that restricts script access to the network and file system.

Known errors:
* Failure to capture or upload dSYMs, resulting in unsymbolicated crashes in the New Relic dashboard.
* Build log error: `run-symbol-tool: upload_dsym_results.log: Operation not permitted`

## Solution

To resolve these errors, you must disable the **User Script Sandboxing** build setting. This allows the New Relic post-build script the necessary permissions to locate your dSYM files and upload them to New Relic servers.

Follow these steps to update your configuration:

1.  In the Xcode **Project Navigator**, select your project.
2.  Select your application **Target**.
3.  Click on the **Build Settings** tab.
4.  Search for **User Script Sandboxing** (or `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING`).
5.  Set the value to **No**.

Once this setting is disabled, we recommend performing a clean build (**Product > Clean Build Folder**) to ensure the `run-symbol-tool` executes correctly on the next build cycle.
