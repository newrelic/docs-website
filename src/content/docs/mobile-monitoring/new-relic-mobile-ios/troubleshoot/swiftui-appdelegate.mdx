# Adding an AppDelegate To Your SwiftUI App
## SwiftUI projects do not generate with an AppDelegate file, which is a necessary component to install and configure New Relic functionality with iOS/tvOS applications. To add an AppDelegate to your SwiftUI App, follow the steps detailed here.
Before adding the AppDelegate, follow the [outlined procedure](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/spm-installation.mdx) to correctly install the New Relic agent. 

1. Add a new file to your project named `AppDelegate`
2. Then in that file add a class named `AppDelegate` that inherits from NSObject and conforms to the UIApplicationDelegate protocol. 
3. In the AppDelegate class you created, add the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function. 
4. As close to the start of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as possible add `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")` replacing APP_TOKEN with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).

<Callout variant="important">
    To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
</Callout>

```
import UIKit
import NewRelic

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        
        NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: "APP_TOKEN")
        
        return true
    }
}
```

5. In the main app structure object add the following line: `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate`. 

```
@main
struct SwiftUI_ExampleApp: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
```

That is all you need to do to add an AppDelegate.swift file to your SwiftUI application and start the New Relic iOS agent in the recommended way.
