These procedures apply only to tvOS apps using Cocoapods. For all other types of tvOS apps, see [tvOS installation and configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/tvos-installation-configuration).

## Install your tvOS application

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS application:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/mobile)**.
2. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select <Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   **Add a new app**.
3. From the **Get Started** page, select **tvOS** as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, and select **Continue**.

Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Objective-C

These procedures to configure your tvOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the **Get Started** page in New Relic.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgentTVOS'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. In your `[app_name]-Prefix.pch` project file (generally found in the **Supporting Files** folder), include the New Relic header inside the `#ifdef __OBJC__ #endif` block:

   ```
   #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h>
   ```
5. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

   ```
   [NewRelicAgent startWithApplicationToken:@"<appToken>"];
   ```
6. Add a **build script** to your target's **Build Phases** and paste the following, replacing "`PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE`" with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/bash "${SCRIPT}" "PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```
7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

Within a few minutes you will begin to see data for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app)**.

## Configure using Swift

These procedures to configure your tvOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic Mobile.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgentTVOS'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. Create a bridging header:

   1. Select **File > New > File > Objective-C File**.
   2. Name the file `Placeholder.m`, then select **Next**.
   3. Select **Create**, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header.
5. In your **\[app_name]-Bridging-Header.h**, add the New Relic header:

   ```
   #import "NewRelic/NewRelic.h"
   ```
6. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

   ```
   NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken("<appToken>");
   ```
7. Add a **build script** to your target's **Build Phases** and paste the following, replacing `NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/bash "${SCRIPT}" NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN
   ```
8. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

## Change the logging level (optional)

Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling `startWithApplicationToken`:

```
[NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL];
```
