We recommend that you use our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0qwLv87gkj5) to set up iOS monitoring. However, if you need to install the agent manually, follow the steps below to install the New Relic iOS agent (in an XCFramework package) and add it to your XCode project.

<Steps>

    Download the latest iOS agent (XCFramework) from our [iOS agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes).  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Navigate to where the iOS agent was downloaded and unzip it.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    In your Xcode project, add the unzipped XCFramework:

    1. Right-click on your Project navigator and click **Add Files to `[YourProjectName]`**.
    2. Select the `NewRelic.xcframework` directory and click **Add**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Embed the iOS agent:

    2. Click on the target to which you want to add the agent.
    3. Click the **General** tab.
    4. Scroll down to the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section.
