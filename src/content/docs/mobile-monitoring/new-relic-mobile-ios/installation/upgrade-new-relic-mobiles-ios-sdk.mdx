Here is an example of the workflow to remove your existing iOS agent framework so you can replace it with a newer version.

1. From the Project Navigator (**CMD 1**) in Xcode, search for **NewRelicAgent.framework**.
2. Right-click or control-click **NewRelicAgent.framework**, and select **Show in Finder**.
3. Drag **NewRelicAgent.framework** to the trash.
4. Verify that the Xcode project highlights the reference to **NewRelicAgent.framework** in red.
5. Right-click or control-click **NewRelicAgent.framework**, and select **Delete** to remove the obsolete reference from the project.
6. Continue with the standard installation procedures for iOS app monitoring at **[rpm.newrelic.com/mobile](https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile) > (select an app) > Settings > Installation**.
