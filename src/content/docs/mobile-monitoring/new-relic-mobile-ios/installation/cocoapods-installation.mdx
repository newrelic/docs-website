We recommend that you use our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0qwLv87gkj5) to set up iOS monitoring. However, if you need to install the agent manually, follow the steps below to install the New Relic iOS agent with Cocoapods.

## Install your iOS application [#installation]

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS or tvOS application:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
2. (If applicable) From the <DNT>**Mobile Apps**</DNT> list, select <DNT>**Add a new app**</DNT>.
3. From the <DNT>**Get Started**</DNT> page, select <DNT>**iOS**</DNT> as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, then select <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.

Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Objective-C [#objective-c]

These procedures to configure your iOS/tvOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the <DNT>**Get Started**</DNT> page in New Relic.

1. In the `Podfile` for your project, add this line:

   ```ruby
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```

2. Close your project in Xcode, then open your terminal and run this command in your project's directory:

   ```shell
   pod install
   ```

3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command in the terminal:

   ```shell
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```

4. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, add this New Relic header:

   ```objectivec
   #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h>
   ```

5. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```objectivec
   [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@"APP_TOKEN"];
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     The agent must be on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>

6. Download this repo: [https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

7. From the downloaded repo, copy `dsym-upload-tools` into the folder that contains your `xcodeproject` file. You should now have a folder containing these files:

   * `YOUR_PROJECT.xcodeproj`
   * `dsym-upload-tools/`

8. Based on your iOS agent version, add the build script below to your target's <DNT>**Build Phases**</DNT>. Make sure the script is the very last build script, and replace `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).
   * For iOS agent 7.4.0 or higher:
   ```shell
   ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}"
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
   * For iOS agent 7.3.8 or lower:
   ```shell
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```

9. (Optional) Add the following lines to your build script above to skip symbol upload during debugging:

   ```shell
   if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
       echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

10. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or on another device.

## Configure using Swift [#configuration]

These procedures to configure your iOS/tvOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the <DNT>**Get Started**</DNT> page in New Relic.

1. In the <DNT>**Podfile**</DNT> for your project, add the following line:

   ```ruby
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```

2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the terminal in your project directory:

   ```shell
   pod install
   ```

3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the terminal in your project directory:

   ```shell
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```

4. In your `AppDelegate.swift`, add the New Relic header:
   (If your app is written in SwiftUI, follow these [instructions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/troubleshoot/swiftui-appdelegate) to add an AppDelegate to your project.)

   ```swift
   import NewRelic
   ```

5. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```swift
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later (on a background thread or asynchronously) can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>

6. Download this repo: [https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

7. From the downloaded repo, copy `dsym-upload-tools` into the folder that contains your `xcodeproject` file. You should now have a folder containing these files:

   * `YOUR_PROJECT.xcodeproj`
   * `dsym-upload-tools/`

8. Based on your iOS agent version, add the build script below to your target's <DNT>**Build Phases**</DNT>. Make sure the script is the very last build script, and replace `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).
   * For iOS agent 7.4.0 or higher:
   ```swift
   ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}"
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
   * For iOS agent 7.3.8 or lower:
   ```swift
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```

9. (Optional) Add the following lines to your build script above to skip symbol upload during debugging:

   ```swift
   if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
       echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

10. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or on another device.

## (Optional) Change the logging level [#logging]

By default, the iOS agent logs at the `info` level. you can change the log level to collect more or less data. There are six supported log levels:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

<Callout variant="important">
  Only increase the log level to `verbose` or higher for debugging, not for release builds.
</Callout>

To change the logging level in your app, add this method call before calling `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken)`:

* Objective-c:

  ```objectivec
  [NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL];
  ```

* Swift:

  ```swift
  NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue)
  ```
