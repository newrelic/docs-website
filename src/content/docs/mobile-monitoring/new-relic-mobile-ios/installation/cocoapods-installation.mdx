These procedures apply to iOS apps using Cocoapods. For other types, see [iOS installation and configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring-installation/ios-installation-and-configuration).

## Install your iOS application [#installation]

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS application:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select **Add a new app**.
3. From the **Get Started** page, select **iOS** as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, then select **Continue**.
5. If your installation does not automatically include the prefix header, follow the steps to [add the prefix header to your project](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/adding-prefix-header-ios-project/).

Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Objective-C [#objective-c]

These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the **Get Started** page in New Relic.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. In your `APP_NAME-Prefix.pch` project file (generally found in the `Supporting Files` folder), include the New Relic header inside the `#ifdef __OBJC__ #endif` block:

   ```
   #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h>
   ```
5. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@"APP_TOKEN"];
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     The agent must be on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>
6. Add a build script to your target's **Build Phases**. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

## Configure using Swift [#configuration]

These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the **Get Started** page in New Relic.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. Create a bridging header:

   1. Select **File > New > File > Objective-C File**.
   2. Name the file `Placeholder.m`, then select **Next**.
   3. Select **Create**, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header.
5. In your `APP_NAME-Bridging-Header.h`, add the New Relic header:

   ```
   #import "NewRelic/NewRelic.h"
   ```
6. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>
7. Add a build script to your target's **Build Phases**. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
8. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

## Change the logging level (optional) [#logging]

Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken)`:

```
[NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL];
```

For Swift apps:

```
NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue)
```
