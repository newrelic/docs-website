With the fourth major version of the iOS agent, New Relic Mobile includes crash reporting. This new feature changes the standard installation procedures, including:

* A post build script is required to upload dSYMs so that crash reports can be properly interpreted.
* An additional framework (**libc++.dylib**) must be added to projects including New Relic.

## Getting started

Before upgrading to agent version 4, you must identify which agent version your app currently includes by [enabling logging](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/getting-started/ios-installation-configuration#logging) in the New Relic agent. The version number appears in each New Relic log message. This example shows major version 4, build 73:

```

## Update the agent [#updating]

After verifying and upgrading your agent version, follow standard [iOS installation and configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/getting-started/ios-installation-configuration) procedures, or go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Add more data**.
