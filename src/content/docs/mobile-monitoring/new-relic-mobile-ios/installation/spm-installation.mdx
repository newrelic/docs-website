We recommend that you use our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0qwLv87gkj5) to set up iOS monitoring. However, if you need to install the agent manually, follow the steps below to install the New Relic iOS agent with Swift Package Manager.

## Install your iOS application [#installation]

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS/tvOS application:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
2. If applicable: From the <DNT>**Mobile Apps**</DNT> list, select <DNT>**Add a new app**</DNT>.
3. From the <DNT>**Get Started**</DNT> page, select <DNT>**iOS**</DNT> as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, then select <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.

Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Swift Package Manager

1. Select <DNT>**File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...**</DNT>.

2. Add the Github URL of the Package file:

   ```
   https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm
   ```

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you receive an `artifact of binary target 'NewRelic' failed extraction: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (TSCBasic.StringError error 1.)` error when extracting the package, please close Xcode, delete the Derrived Data folder, re-open Xcode, and try again.
   </Callout>

3. Select the NewRelic package product, select your target, and select <DNT>**Finish**</DNT>.

4. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `applicationDidFinishLaunchWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):
   (If your app is written in SwiftUI, follow these [instructions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/troubleshoot/swiftui-appdelegate) to add an AppDelegate to your project.)

   ```swift
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>

5. Based on your iOS agent version, add the build script below to your target's <DNT>**Build Phases**</DNT>. Make sure the script is the very last build script, and replace `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token).
   * For iOS agent 7.4.0 or higher:
   ```shell
   ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}"
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
   * For iOS Agent 7.3.8 or lower:
   ```shell
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```

6. (Optional) Add the following lines to your build script above to skip symbol upload during debugging:

   ```shell
   if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
       echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

7. If there is a checkbox that says "Run script: Based on Dependency analysis", make sure it is unchecked.

8. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

You might see the following errors when adding the Swift package:

* Artifact does not match checksum
* Cannot download framework from remoteSourceControl

If you see these types of errors, try the following:

1. De-integrate New Relic Swift package from the Xcode project.
2. Run these commands from the terminal to delete spm caches:
   ```shell
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
   rm -rf ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm
   ```
3. Delete derived data using Xcode.
4. Re-integrate the New Relic Swift package into the Xcode project.

## (Optional) Change the logging level [#logging]

By default, the iOS agent logs at the `info` level. you can change the log level to collect more or less data. There are six supported log levels:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

<Callout variant="important">
  Only increase the log level to `verbose` or higher for debugging, not for release builds.
</Callout>

To change the logging level in your app, add this method call before calling `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken)`:

```swift
NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue)
```
