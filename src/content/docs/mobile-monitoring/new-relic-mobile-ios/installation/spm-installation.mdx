metaDescription: How to instrument to your iOS applications using Swift Package Manager.
---

These procedures apply to iOS apps using Swift Package Manager. For other types, see [iOS installation and configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring-installation/ios-installation-and-configuration).

## Install your iOS application [#installation]

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS application:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select **Add a new app**.
3. From the **Get Started** page, select **iOS** as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, then select **Continue**.

Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Swift Package Manager

1. Select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...**.

2. Add the Github URL of the Package file:

   ```
   https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ios-agent-spm
   ```

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you receive an `artifact of binary target 'NewRelic' failed extraction: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (TSCBasic.StringError error 1.)` error when extracting the package, please close Xcode, delete the Derrived Data folder, re-open Xcode, and try again.
   </Callout>

3. Select the NewRelic package product, select your target, and select Finish.

4. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `applicationDidFinishLaunchWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>

5. Add a build script to your target's **Build Phases**. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):
    - iOS Agent 7.4.0+:
    ```
    "${BUILD_DIR%/Build/*}/SourcePackages/artifacts/newrelic-ios-agent-spm/NewRelic.xcframework/Resources/run-symbol-tool" "APP_TOKEN"
    ```

    - iOS Agent 7.3.8 or before:
    ```
    SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`

    if [ -z "${SCRIPT}"]; then
     ARTIFACT_DIR="${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/artifacts"
     SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
    fi

    /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
    ```

   - Add the following lines to your build script above the existing lines to skip symbol upload during debugging.
    ```
    if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
        echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
        exit 0
    fi
    ```

6. If there is a checkbox below Run script that says "Run script: Based on Dependency analysis" please make sure it is not checked.

7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

You might see the following errors when adding the Swift package:

- Artifact does not match checksum
- Cannot download framework from remoteSourceControl

If you see these types of errors, try the following:

1. De-integrate New Relic Swift package from the Xcode project.
2. Run these commands from the terminal to delete spm caches:
    ```
    rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
    rm -rf ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm
    ```
3. Delete derived data using Xcode.
4. Re-integrate the New Relic Swift package into the Xcode project.

## Change the logging level (optional) [#logging]

Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken)`:

```
NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue)
```
