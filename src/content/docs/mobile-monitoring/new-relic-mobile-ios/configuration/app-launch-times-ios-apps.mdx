<Callout variant="important">
  This feature is supported in iOS agent version 7.4.0 and higher. App launch times are not reported when using simulators or during debugging.
</Callout>

With the iOS agent, you can report app launch time, also known as "cold time" and "hot time" (warm and prewarmed times are not reported). By default, app launch times are collected with the feature flag [`NRFeatureFlag_AppStartMetrics`](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings/#applaunchtime).

## View app launch time [#app-launch-time]

Your app launch time is reported with the metrics `AppLaunch/Cold` and `AppLaunch/Hot`. To track these launch time metrics:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Capabilities > Query builder**</DNT>.
2. Run a [NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-nrql-mode-query-data/), such as:
   ```sql
   SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value ) AS 'AppLaunch/Cold' FROM Metric WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'AppLaunch/Cold' AND entity.guid = 'YOUR_APP_TOKEN' SINCE 1664218800000 UNTIL 1664220600000 TIMESERIES
   ```
3. Click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT> and either add it to an existing dashboard or create a new one.

If no data appears, review your `logcat` output for errors.
