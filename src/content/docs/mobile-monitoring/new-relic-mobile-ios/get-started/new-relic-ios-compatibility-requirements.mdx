Before you [install and configure](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/ios-installation-configuration) the iOS agent, follow these guidelines for compatibility and other requirements.

## Foreground monitoring [#foreground]

The iOS agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our [Mobile data privacy and security documentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/get-started/security-mobile-apps).

## iOS requirements [#requirements]

Make sure your iOS app meets these requirements:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        <DNT>
          **Component**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **iOS application requirements**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Operating system
      </td>

      <td>
        iOS 10 or higher

        Apple no longer supports bitcode-based submissions to the App Store. Bitcode is not supported by our iOS agent.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        API/SDK
      </td>

      <td>
        * NSURLConnection and AFNetworking are supported.
        * NSURLSession supports `upload` and `data` functions only.
        * URLSession in Swift supports async `upload` and `data` functions only.
        * Network traffic for UIWebView and WKWebView is supported. However, WKWebView Transfer size and Http errors are not supported.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Languages
      </td>

      <td>
        * Objective-C
        * Swift: Works with both network traces and crash reporting, but no interaction traces by default. Interaction traces must be [enabled for Swift](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/enabling-interaction-tracing-swift).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Devices
      </td>

      <td>
        Any iOS compatible device: iPhones, iPads, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        File sizes
      </td>

      <td>
        The agent adds about 2 to 12 megabytes to your iOS release app, depending on platform build.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Architectures
      </td>

      <td>
        ARM 64-bit.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        SHA-2
      </td>

      <td>
        As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/security/new-relic-security/data-privacy/security-controls-privacy), New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Xcode
      </td>

      <td>
        To take advantage of New Relic's iOS features, make sure you have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        arm64e support
      </td>

      <td>
        To be able to properly symbolicate crashes from devices with arm64e architectures, make sure your Xcode settings are enabled for pointer authentication. For more information, see the [Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication?language=objc).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        CocoaPods
      </td>

      <td>
        In order to use the latest iOS agent, use CocoaPods version 1.10.1 or higher.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## tvOS [#tvos]

The iOS agent can monitor tvOS apps. For details, see [tvOS compatibility](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/tvos/new-relic-tvos-compatibility-requirements).

## Testing is not supported [#testing]

Our agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior.

## Potential method replacement conflicts [#method]

Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Firebase, Aspects, and AppleGuice.
