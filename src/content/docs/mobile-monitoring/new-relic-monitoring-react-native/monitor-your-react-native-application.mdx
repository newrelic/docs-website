Our New Relic React Native agent monitors your React Native mobile app and provides deep insights into your app's performance, errors, and user experience. Written in JavaScript, the React Native agent includes all New Relic mobile monitoring features we offer for native mobile apps. Once you install and configure the React Native agent, you'll be able to:

* **Capture JavaScript errors** Identify and fix problems quickly.
* **Track network requests:** See how your app interacts with the backend.
* **Use distributed tracing:** Drill down into handled exceptions and find the root cause.
* **Create custom events and metrics:** Understand how your users interact with your app.

</figcaption>

The agent allows your team to understand the health of your hybrid app regardless of the platform. We empower your team to make more informed development choices by providing insight into Javascript errors, distributed tracing, network instrumentation, and more.

## Compatability equirements [#requirements]

Before you install the React Native agent, ensure your app meets these requirements:

* [iOS native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)
* [Android native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)

Native support levels are based on [React Native requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#-requirements).

## Install the agent [#installation]

To install the React Native agent, follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/01wZvXb8Bw6), located directly in the UI.

### Expo integration (optional) [#optional-expo-integration]

After installing the React Native agent, integration with Expo is automatic with [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow) but requires some extra steps for [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) via [config plugins](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/).

To set up [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow), after installing our package, add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

```javascript
    {
      "name": "my app",
      "plugins": ["newrelic-react-native-agent"]
    }
```

For the managed work flow, use the `expo prebuild --clean` command as described in the [Adding custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) guide to rebuild your app with the plugin changes. If this command is not running, you'll get errors when starting the New Relic agent. For Expo Go users, the agent will require using native code. Since Expo Go does not support sending custom native code over-the-air, you can follow Expo's documentation on [how to use custom native code in Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/using-expo-client/).

## Routing Instrumentation

To instrument routing and navigation for your React Native apps: 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="react-nav"
        title="React Navigation"
    >
        * For [react-navigation v5](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation):

        Set the `onStateChange` to `NewRelic.onStateChange` in your NavigationContainer as follows:

        ```javascript
        <NavigationContainer
        onStateChange={  NewRelic.onStateChange  }  />
        ```
        * For react-navigation v4 and below:
        Set the `onNavigationStateChange` to `NewRelic.onNavigationStateChange` in your App wrapper as follows:

        ```javascript
        export  default () => (
        <App
        onNavigationStateChange={ NewRelic.onNavigationStateChange  }  />
        );
        ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="react-native-nav"
        title="React Native Navigation"
    >
        For [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation), you can either:

        Register `NewRelic.componentDidAppearListener` listener using:

        ```javascript
        Navigation.events().registerComponentDidAppearListener( NewRelic.componentDidAppearListener );
        ```

        Or, you can report your screen changes manually using the following API:


        ```js
        var params = {
            'screenName':'screenName'
          };
          
          NewRelic.recordBreadcrumb('navigation',params);
        
        ```
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Customize the agent instrumentation [#mobile-sdk]

Need to customize your agent instrumentation? Our public mobile SDK API methods let you collect custom data, configure default settings, and more.

The following customizations are available for the React Native agent.

## Troubleshoot JavaScript errors [#javascript-errors]

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="v1.2.0"
        title="React Native Agent v1.2.0 and higher"
    >
        JavaScript errors and promise rejections can be seen in the `Handled Exceptions` tab in New Relic One. You will be able to see the event trail, attributes, and stack trace for each JavaScript error recorded. 

        You can also find these errors by running this query:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM MobileHandledException SINCE 24 hours ago
        ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="v1.1.0"
        title="React Native Agent v1.1.0 and lower"
    >
        The React Native agent creates custom events for JavaScript errors and reports them to New Relic. In the UI, you can track these JavaScript error events with a custom dashboard.

        To create a custom dashboard:
        1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
        2. Click **Query your data**.
        3. Run this query:

          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM `JS Errors`
          ```
        4. Click **Add to dashboard**.
        <img
            title="Query your data"
            alt="This is an image of a sample query in the Query builder."
            src={mobileQueryExample}
          />

## JavaScript console logs [#javascript-logs]

To view JavaScript console logs in New Relic, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Query your data** and add this query to find those JavaScript console logs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM consoleEvents SINCE 24 HOURS AGO
```
