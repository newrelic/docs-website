Our New Relic React Native agent monitors your React Native mobile app and provides deep insights into your app's performance, errors, and user experience. Written in JavaScript, the React Native agent includes all New Relic mobile monitoring features we offer for native mobile apps. Once you install and configure the React Native agent, you'll be able to:

* **Capture JavaScript errors** Identify and fix problems quickly.
* **Track network requests:** See how your app interacts with the backend.
* **Use distributed tracing:** Drill down into handled exceptions and find the root cause.
* **Create custom events and metrics:** Understand how your users interact with your app.

## Install the agent [#installation]

To install the React Native agent, follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/01wZvXb8Bw6), located directly in the UI.

If you need to install the agent manually, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the React Native agent [#install]

Run the following:

  ```shell
  npm i newrelic-react-native-agent
  ```
</Step>
<Step>
### Configure your application [#add-code]

Open your `index.js` and add the following code to launch New Relic:

```js
import NewRelic from 'newrelic-react-native-agent';
import {name, version} from './package.json';
import {Platform} from 'react-native';
    let appToken;
    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        appToken = '<IOS-APP-TOKEN>';
    } else {
        appToken = '<ANDROID-APP-TOKEN>';
    }
 const agentConfiguration = {
    
    //Android Specific
    // Optional:Enable or disable collection of event data.
    analyticsEventEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Enable or disable crash reporting.
    crashReportingEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Enable or disable interaction tracing. Trace instrumentation still occurs, but no traces are harvested. This will disable default and custom interactions.
    interactionTracingEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Enable or disable reporting successful HTTP requests to the MobileRequest event type.
    networkRequestEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Enable or disable reporting network and HTTP request errors to the MobileRequestError event type.
    networkErrorRequestEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Enable or disable capture of HTTP response bodies for HTTP error traces, and MobileRequestError events.
    httpRequestBodyCaptureEnabled: true,
   // Optional:Enable or disable agent logging.
    loggingEnabled: true,
    // Optional:Specifies the log level. Omit this field for the default log level.
    // Options include: ERROR (least verbose), WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE, AUDIT (most verbose).
    logLevel: NewRelic.LogLevel.INFO,
    // iOS Specific
    // Optional:Enable/Disable automatic instrumentation of WebViews
    webViewInstrumentation: true,
    // Optional:Set a specific collector address for sending data. Omit this field for default address.
    // collectorAddress: "",
    // Optional:Set a specific crash collector address for sending crashes. Omit this field for default address.
    // crashCollectorAddress: "",
    // Optional:Enable or disable reporting data using different endpoints for US government clients
    // fedRampEnabled: false
  };
NewRelic.startAgent(appToken,agentConfiguration);
NewRelic.setJSAppVersion(version);
AppRegistry.registerComponent(name, () => App);
```

<Callout variant="important">
Please be sure to enter your proper application tokens. `appToken` is platform-specific. You will need to generate a separate token for Android and iOS apps.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>
### (Android-native apps only) Install the Android agent [#android-install]

1. [Install the New Relic native Android agent](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-android-apps-gradle-android-studio).
2. Update `build.gradle`:
  ```  buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
      ...
      mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
      ...
      classpath "com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:6.11.1"
    }
  ```
3. Update `app/build.gradle`:
  ```
  apply plugin: "com.android.application"
  apply plugin: 'newrelic' // <-- add this
  ```
4. Make sure your app requests `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permissions by adding these lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  ```
</Step>
<Step>
### (iOS-native apps only) Install the iOS agent [#ios-install]

To ensure that the React Native agent is compatible with all iOS frameworks, install the New Relic iOS agent:

```shell
npx pod-install
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Configure autolinking and rebuilding [#autolinking-and-rebuilding]
The React Native New Relic library must be linked to your project and your application needs to be rebuilt. If you use React Native 0.60+, you automatically have access to autolinking, requiring no further manual installation steps.

For Android:

```shell
npx react-native run-android
```

For iOS:

```shell
cd ios/
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

In order to make sure that the React Native application functioning properly, you can run following commands, and fatal JS errors will show up as a crash in the New Relic UI.

For Android:

```shell
npx react-native run-android --variant=release
```

For iOS:

```shell
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
```

</Step>

<Step>
### (Optional) Integrate with Expo [#optional-expo-integration]

After installing the React Native agent, integration with Expo is automatic with [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow) but requires some extra steps for [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) via [config plugins](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/).

To set up [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow), after installing our package, add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

```javascript
    {
      "name": "my app",
      "plugins": ["newrelic-react-native-agent"]
    }
```

For the managed work flow, use the `expo prebuild --clean` command as described in the [Adding custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) guide to rebuild your app with the plugin changes. If this command is not running, you'll get errors when starting the New Relic agent. For Expo Go users, the agent will require using native code. Since Expo Go does not support sending custom native code over-the-air, you can follow Expo's documentation on [how to use custom native code in Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/using-expo-client/).

</Step>

  <Step>

### (Optional) Configure instrument routing and navigation

To instrument routing and navigation for your React Native apps: 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="react-nav"
        title="React Navigation"
    >
        * For [react-navigation v5](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation):

        Set the `onStateChange` to `NewRelic.onStateChange` in your NavigationContainer as follows:

        ```javascript
        <NavigationContainer
        onStateChange={  NewRelic.onStateChange  }  />
        ```
        * For react-navigation v4 and below:
        Set the `onNavigationStateChange` to `NewRelic.onNavigationStateChange` in your App wrapper as follows:

        ```javascript
        export  default () => (
        <App
        onNavigationStateChange={ NewRelic.onNavigationStateChange  }  />
        );
        ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="react-native-nav"
        title="React Native Navigation"
    >
        For [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation), you can either:

        Register `NewRelic.componentDidAppearListener` listener using:

        ```javascript
        Navigation.events().registerComponentDidAppearListener( NewRelic.componentDidAppearListener );
        ```

        Or, you can report your screen changes manually using the following API:


        ```js
        var params = {
            'screenName':'screenName'
          };
          
          NewRelic.recordBreadcrumb('navigation',params);
        
        ```
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

</Step>
  </Steps>

## Troubleshoot JavaScript errors [#javascript-errors]

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="v1.2.0"
        title="React Native Agent v1.2.0 and higher"
    >
        JavaScript errors and promise rejections can be seen in the `Handled Exceptions` tab in New Relic One. You will be able to see the event trail, attributes, and stack trace for each JavaScript error recorded. 

        You can also find these errors by running this query:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM MobileHandledException SINCE 24 hours ago
        ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="v1.1.0"
        title="React Native Agent v1.1.0 and lower"
    >
        The React Native agent creates custom events for JavaScript errors and reports them to New Relic. In the UI, you can track these JavaScript error events with a custom dashboard.

        To create a custom dashboard:
        1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
        2. Click **Query your data**.
        3. Run this query:

          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM `JS Errors`
          ```
        4. Click **Add to dashboard**.
        <img
            title="Query your data"
            alt="This is an image of a sample query in the Query builder."
            src={mobileQueryExample}
          />
