Well-defined alerts help notify individuals or teams about changes in their systems. You can use any of our [alerts and applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence) capabilities across all the entities you monitor with New Relic.

For example, you can use [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts) to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for mobile apps you monitor with New Relic. After you [define alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions) for your mobile apps, you can view that information in the alerts UI or in other UI experiences, like the mobile monitoring UI.

## Mobile alert conditions [#conditions]

Use any of the following conditions and thresholds when you set up alerts for your mobile apps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="execution"
    title="Execution time"
  >
    Execution time metrics include **Database**, **Images**, **JSON**, **Network**, and **View loading**. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting a time and duration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="errors"
    title="Errors"
  >
    Error metrics include **Network error percentage** and **Status error percentage**. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting a error percentage and duration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="crash"
    title="Crash reporting"
  >
    You may want to be notified when your app's **crash rate** goes above a certain threshold. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting an error percentage and duration.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Get notified about your exceeding app crash rate as soon as it happens by setting up [notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts), including PagerDuty and Slack.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom"
    title="Custom"
  >
    Create your own **custom metric** to fit specific alert needs. Add a name for the customized metric, and define your own thresholds.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## View policies and conditions [#policy]

To view alert policy and condition information for a specific mobile app:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > Alert conditions**.
2. From the **Alert conditions** page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies.

## View events and activities [#activity]

To view summary information about [events](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#event) and other activity directly from the mobile monitoring UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**.
2. From the index, mouse over the entity's [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status), select a link from the **Mobile activity** list, or select a mobile app to view additional details.

For example, if a **Critical** alert violation occurs:

* The health status indicator turns red on the mobile index and on the selected app.
* The background color for various charts changes to pink.
* On your list of monitored mobile apps, the **Application activity** section shows **Warning** (yellow) and **Critical** (red) violations as applicable.

To learn more about an alert violation, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart.

## View alert violations [#violations]

<Callout variant="important">
  In July 2020, we transitioned alert violations for browser apps, mobile apps, fand synthetic monitors to a new format in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**. For more information, see the [applied intelligence and alerting](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai) docs.
</Callout>

If an alert condition has [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) set up for **Warning** (yellow) or **Critical** (red) violations, the color-coded [health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status) for a product entity will change to indicate a violation. You can view the violations directly from the mobile app's page in New Relic:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**.
2. Select a mobile app, and then review its **Open violations**.
