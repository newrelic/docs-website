Well-defined <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> help notify individuals or teams about changes in their systems. You can use any of our [alerting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence) capabilities across all the entities you monitor with New Relic.

For example, you can use [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts) to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for mobile apps you monitor with New Relic. After you [define alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions) for your mobile apps, you can view that information in the alerts UI or in other UI experiences, like the <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> UI.

## Mobile alert conditions [#conditions]

Use any of the following conditions and thresholds when you set up alerts for your mobile apps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="execution"
    title="Execution time"
  >
    Execution time metrics include <DNT>**Database**</DNT>, <DNT>**Images**</DNT>, <DNT>**JSON**</DNT>, <DNT>**Network**</DNT>, and <DNT>**View loading**</DNT>. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting a time and duration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="errors"
    title="Errors"
  >
    Error metrics include <DNT>**Network error percentage**</DNT> and <DNT>**Status error percentage**</DNT>. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting a error percentage and duration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="crash"
    title="Crash reporting"
  >
    You may want to be notified when your app's <DNT>**crash rate**</DNT> goes above a certain threshold. Define the thresholds for these metrics by selecting an error percentage and duration.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Get notified about your exceeding app crash rate as soon as it happens by setting up [notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts), including PagerDuty and Slack.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom"
    title="Custom"
  >
    Create your own <DNT>**custom metric**</DNT> to fit specific alert needs. Add a name for the customized metric, and define your own thresholds.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## View policies and conditions [#policy]

To view alert policy and condition information for a specific mobile app:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > Alert conditions**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Alert conditions**</DNT> page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies.

## View events and activities [#activity]

To view summary information about [events](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#event) and other activity directly from the mobile monitoring UI:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**</DNT>.
2. From the index, mouse over the entity's [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status), select a link from the <DNT>**Mobile activity**</DNT> list, or select a mobile app to view additional details.

For example, if a <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> alert incident occurs:

* The health status indicator turns red on the mobile index and on the selected app.
* The background color for various charts changes to pink.
* On your list of monitored mobile apps, the <DNT>**Application activity**</DNT> section shows <DNT>**Warning**</DNT> (yellow) and <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> (red) incidents as applicable.

To learn more about an alert incident, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart.

## View alert incidents [#incidents]

<Callout variant="important">
  In July 2020, we transitioned alert incidents for browser apps, mobile apps, and synthetic monitors to a new format in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>. For more information, see the [alerting](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai) docs.
</Callout>

If an alert condition has [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) set up for <DNT>**Warning**</DNT> (yellow) or <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> (red) incidents, the color-coded [health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status) for a product entity will change to indicate an incident. You can view the incidents directly from the mobile app's page in New Relic:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**</DNT>.
2. Select a mobile app, and then review its <DNT>**Open incidents**</DNT>.
