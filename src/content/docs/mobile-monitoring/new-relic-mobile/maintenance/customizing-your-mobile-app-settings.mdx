## Change name of monitored app [#change-name]

You can change your app's name in the UI anytime, and our mobile monitoring will continue to collect, aggregate, and report data to your app based on the underlying [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token) used when configuring your mobile app. This means you do not need to change any code in your application.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Data reported from your mobile app is tied to a named app based on the application token. All apps with a single application token will report into the same app in our mobile monitoring UI, regardless of the app's name when installed on a mobile device.
</Callout>

To rename your mobile app:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), click **Mobile**, and select a monitored app.
2. Select **Application**. Type a new name and select **Save settings**.
