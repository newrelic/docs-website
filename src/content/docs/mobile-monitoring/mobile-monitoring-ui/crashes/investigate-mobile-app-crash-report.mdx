3. Review the selected crash report's [summary and detail information](#dashboard-drilldown).
4. Optional: [Query or share the chart data](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes#insights).
5. [Optional:](#details) Export to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code for easier debugging.
6. To [file a ticket](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/file-tickets-mobile-app-crashes), select any of the options integrated with your system.
7. To close the crash report: At the top of the report, select **Mark resolved**.

## View crash report drill-down details [#dashboard-drilldown]

Use any of New Relic's [standard UI functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information. The **Crash report** page includes several additional options.

    The crash summary contains aggregated information about all occurrences of this crash:

    * **Crash identifier:** The unique identifier for this crash, which contains information such as exception name, crashing file, line, message, and function
    * **Crash occurrences chart:** A chart showing the number of occurrences of this particular crash over the selected time period since the first time the crash was detected
    * **Breakdown of crash type:** A stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of operating system versions where this crash occurred or devices affected
    * **Users affected and occurrences:** Counts for the number of unique users and number of times the crash occurred
  </Collapser>

    Each crash sample provides details about the device where the crash occurred, including:

    * **App version:** The application version where the crash occurred
    * **Device type:** The specific device where the crash occurred
    * **OS version:** The operating system version of the device
    * **RAM used:** The amount of memory used by the application at the time of the crash
    * **Disk free:** The amount of free disk space on the device at the time of the crash
    * **Attributes:** Details about attributes related to the crash report which you can collapse or expand for deeper analysis

      If applicable, you can **Export crash details** to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code for easier debugging.

    The stack trace for the thread that generated the crashing exception appears below the crash details. Each frame of the stack shows the library or package name and the method associated with that stack frame.

    The agent attempts to detect which frame of the stack contains the programming flaw responsible for the error. If detected, that stack frame appears red.

    To view the state of threads other than the crashing thread, select **See all threads**.

    * iOS apps will only show source code method names and line numbers if you have [uploaded the dSYM](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/ios-agent-crash-reporting) for each build of your application.
    * Android apps using ProGuard will have the package and method names de-obfuscated if you have [enabled ProGuard map uploading](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/android-agent-crash-reporting).
    * Android native crash reports will only show source filename and relative code offsets.
