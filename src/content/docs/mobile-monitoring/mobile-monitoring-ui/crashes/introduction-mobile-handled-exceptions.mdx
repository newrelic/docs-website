metaDescription: Use handled exceptions to prevent exceptions and analyze detailed contextual information to understand why apps ended in a try/catch.

Exceptions can contribute to invalid application states, resulting not only in application crashes but also in negative user reviews. This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the [**Handled exceptions** UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes), mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly.

## Features

Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example:

* How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems.
* Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions?
* When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems?
* What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience?

By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly.

        You can view exception data via API as well as the UI:

        * Use the [`recordHandledException()` method](#hex-api) within a `try{...} catch(){...}` block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions.
        * Use [groups and filters](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes#groups-filters) to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by `OS Build`, then filter a specific `appVersion`.

      <td>
        Examine the [percentage charts](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes#percentage-charts) to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts.

        For example, group on `Last Interaction` to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use [filters](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes#groups-filters), such as:

        * To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by `carrier` and then select `wifi`.
        * To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by `appVersion`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Align issues with common characteristics.
      </td>

      <td>
        For example:

        * Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.).
        * Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the [top five exception locations table](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes#top5-exceptions).
        * Query data and share your findings.

      <td>
        With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles:

        * Use the handled exception's [**Occurrences** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-occurrences) for expected exceptions.
        * Use the [**Crash analysis** UI and event trail](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes) for unanticipated exceptions.

## Requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  Access to this feature depends on your [subscription level](https://newrelic.com/mobile-monitoring/pricing) and [mobile data retention](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/mobile-data-retention).
</Callout>

Additional requirements include:

* **Android:** [Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes)
* **iOS:** [iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes)

## Handled exceptions API and event type [#hex-api]

Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in [the query builder](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights) and get specific details:

* Use the `recordHandledExceptions()` method for the [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api/recordhandledexception-android-sdk-api) or [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api/record-handled-exception) SDK API.
* [Query](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/query-page-create-edit-nrql-queries) the [`MobileHandledException`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-events-attributes#mobilehandledexception-attributes) event type. For more information, see the [NRQL examples](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/insights-query-examples-new-relic-mobile#mobilehandledexception-examples) for mobile monitoring.

You can also [create your own custom attributes and events](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/add-custom-data-new-relic-mobile). Then, select attributes in the [**Handled exceptions** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes), and query or share them.
