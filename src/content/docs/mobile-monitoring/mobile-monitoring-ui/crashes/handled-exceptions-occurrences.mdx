After you use the [**handled exceptions** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes) to explore patterns and trends, you can drill down into deeper details about specific exception occurrences. These can be [events](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/introduction-mobile-handled-exceptions#hex-api) that New Relic monitors by default, or [custom events you created](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/add-custom-data-new-relic-mobile#custom-events).

## View the occurrences details [#hex-occurrences]

To view details for each occurrence of a handled exception:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions**.
2. From the **Top 5 exception locations** table, select a handled exception on any row.

The **Occurrences** page shows details about the selected exception, including breakdown data by device type or operating system, number of users affected, total occurrences for the selected time period, attributes, and more.

## Unsymbolicated stack traces [#unsymbolicated]

New Relic does not store unsymbolicated stack traces for handled exceptions. This is different than the [crash event trail](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/mobile-crash-event-trail). You can [upload a dSYM](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps) later as needed, as new handled exceptions will become symbolicated.
