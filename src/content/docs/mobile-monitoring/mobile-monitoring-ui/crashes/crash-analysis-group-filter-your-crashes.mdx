Mobile app crashes can result in users submitting negative reviews, which can affect your organization's reputation. Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the **Crash analysis** UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions.

## Use crash analysis features [#features]

When your development team receives an [emailed crash notification](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/receive-crash-notifications-email), they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly [through a query](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data). The individual **Crash details** page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution.

Our **Crash analysis** feature helps developers to:

* Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash.
* Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute.
* Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by [filtering by `Last Interaction`](#groups-filters), or by viewing the [event trail](#export-xcode) on the [**Crash type** summary](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report).
* Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices.
* Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session.
* Quickly see trends from the **Crash profiles** tab.

## View the crash list [#crash-list]

To view the filterable **Crash list** in the New Relic UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis**.

   OR

   To view the filterable **Crash analysis** page directly from the [mobile app's **Overview** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-apps-dashboard), select the **Crash occurrences** chart's title.
2. Use any of our [standard page functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart.

## Use the crash analysis workflow [#crash-workflow]

To get the most out of mobile monitoring's **Crash analysis** UI, use this basic workflow.

1. Start with the [**Crash rate percentage** and **Crash-free users percentage** charts](#percentage-charts) to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected [time period](#time-period).
2. Use the [groups and filters](#groups-filters) to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail.
3. Use the [**Top 5 occurrences** chart](#top5-occurrences) to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the [groups and filters](#groups-filters). Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to [crash percentages](#percentage-charts) that occurred during this [time period](#time-period).
4. Optional: [Query or share the chart data](#insights).
5. Look for patterns in the [**Crash location** table](#reports-table) information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash.
6. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its [event trail](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/mobile-crash-event-trail), thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, [resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode](#export-xcode) so you can debug your source code more easily.
7. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as **Resolved**.

Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's [data retention policies](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention#product-mobile), you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information.

  >
    Start with the **Crash rate percentage** and **Crash-free users percentage** charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example:

    * Are there any spikes near a recent version release?
    * Is there a [time period](#time-period) when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the **Crash-free users percentage** chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="groups-filters"
    title="Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data."
  >
    You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including:

    * Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes.
    * Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes.
    * Use the [time picker](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-time-picker) to adjust the currently selected time period.
    * Filter by a specific **Version** or by one or more attribute **Filter**, such as `Last Interaction`, `App Build`, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes).

      The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="top5-occurrences"
    title="Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics."
  >
    Use the **Top 5 occurrences** chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected [time period](#time-period). This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the [group and filters](#groups-filters) you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience.

    * To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes.
    * To look for other historical patterns, change the selected [time period](#time-period).

    Mobile monitoring's **Crash analysis** charts use [default attributes for mobile events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/mobile-default-attributes-insights#mobile-list), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. To view or share the data, click the ellipsis icon.

    * **Add to dashboard** link: [View the chart](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-insights-interface/query-page-creating-editing-nrql-queries), and copy it to a new or existing dashboard.
    * **View query** link: View the [NRQL query](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql) used to calculate the chart data.
    * **Get as image** link: Select this option to get a public URL of the chart, then share it using any media.

    Supplementing the charts, the **Crash report** table lists crash types by location, and links them to relevant crash report details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as:

    * How many of this crash type or exception occurred within the selected [time period](#time-period)?

    * What is the most recent exception message?

    * Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected?

    * When did the exception first and last occur?

      <img

      </figcaption>

      Sometimes it may be more useful to examine crash report data from lowest to highest. For example:

    * Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences?

    * When did a particular exception start (**Earliest occurrence**)?

      You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams.

    From the **Crash types** table, you can drill down into a specific [crash type](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report). From here you can:
    * Explore the related thread breakdown.
    * Select **Export crash details** so you can examine source code using Xcode.
    * Click the **View crash libraries** button to see what Android map files or iOS .dSYM files we have for your application.
    * If you don't see the files you're expecting, upload a new Android map file or iOS .dSYM files by clicking on the **Upload** link. Note that uploading a new file automatically de-obfuscates or symbolicate your crash occurrence.
    * File a ticket and resolve the crash.
