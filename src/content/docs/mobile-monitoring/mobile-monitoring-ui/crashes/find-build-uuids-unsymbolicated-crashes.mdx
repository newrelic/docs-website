If the dSYM is not uploaded to New Relic, [mobile crash reports](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report) cannot be symbolicated. You can [upload dSYMs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps) manually or directly through the New Relic UI. However, every build of an application will create a new dSYM, and it can be difficult managing which dSYM is attributed to which app build.

In this situation, you can use the Build UUID identifier to:

* Identify a unique build of an application.
* Find which dSYM can be used to symbolicate a crash.

## View the Build UUID [#build-uuid]

An application may have more than one Build UUID, one attributed for each CPU architecture the application is built. The Build UUID is also stored within the associated dSYM and can be extracted to identify the dSYM.

New Relic crash reports also contain the Build UUID of the crashing application. To view the Build UUID:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Mobile** in the top nav. Then find your app and click **Crashes > Crash Analysis**.
2. From the [**Crash list** table](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/view-mobile-app-crashes), select any row.
3. From the selected crash report's [**Crash Details** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report#viewing), look for the `App Image Uuid` on the attribute list.

If the `App Image Uuid` is not on the selected crash report's attributes list:

1. [Export the crash details](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report#viewing).
2. Look for the Build UUID in the [**Binary images** section](#binary-example) of the exported crash report.

Use the Build UUID extracted from the crash details to find the missing dSYM.

## Binary images example [#binary-example]

Here is an example of the **Binary images** section from an exported crash report. This section lists the Build UUID for every dynamically-linked library included in the application, as well as the Build UUID for the main application.

In this example, the main application is `New Relic`. Its Build UUID is `117667e7b8d230cb8a908906c64e0227`. This is the identifier you can use to find the associated dSYM.

## Find and resymbolicate the dSYM [#dsym-identification]

To find a dSYM's Build UUID of a dSYM: use `dwarfdump` with the following terminal command:

```
dwarfdump --uuid <path-to-dSYM>
```

In the following example, the New Relic dSYM returns two Build UUIDs, one each for `ARMv7` and `ARM64`. The `ARMv7` Build UUID matches the Build UUID of the missing crash [example](#binary-example):

```
> dwarfdump --uuid ./New\ Relic.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/New\ Relic
UUID: 117667E7-B8D2-30CB-8A90-8906C64E0227 (armv7) ./New Relic.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/New Relic
UUID: B1A8C6EE-02B9-3C55-AEE7-308521873107 (arm64) ./New Relic.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/New Relic
```

To symbolicate the unsymbolicated crashes, follow the instructions to [manually upload the dSYM](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps).
