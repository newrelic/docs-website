When the [alert conditions](/docs/mobile-apps/alert-settings) you set for your mobile app's error rates and response times cross a threshold for an extended period, the <InlinePopover type="mobile" /> agent will create a Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) problem event. If a Critical (red) event has been open for several minutes, mobile will send an alert notification to users who have been set up to receive alert notifications. It will also send a notification when all Critical events close.
