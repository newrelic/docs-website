In mobile monitoring, interactions are a collection of instrumented methods grouped by UIViewControllers (iOS) or Activities (Android). Use our Interactions page to track the most expensive and slow interactions, and investigate what's causing the slowest trace.

## Instrumenting interactions [#instrumentation]

Interactions are automatically instrumented. For details on which classes are auto-instrumented, see:

* [(Android) Automatically instrumented methods](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/mobile-sdk-api-guide/#method-list)
* [(iOS) Automatically instrumented methods](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/mobile-sdk-api-guide/#method-list-ios)

We also offer a manual instrumentation of interactions using the following methods:

* [`startInteraction`](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/start-interaction/)
* [`stopInteraction`](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/stop-interaction/)

If you use the methods `startInteraction` and `stopInteraction`, the instrumented interactions will not show up on the Interactions page, but they can be still found a NRQL query, such as:

```sql
query SELECT name FROM Mobile SINCE 7 DAYS AGO
```

## View the Interactions page [#interactions-page]

The Interactions page has charts that break down the top 20 most expensive interactions and a list of slowest traces. This includes code executing on the main thread and code executing on worker threads.

To view the Interactions page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile >**</DNT> (select an app) <DNT>**> More views > Interactions**</DNT>.
2. To drill down into detailed information, select any interaction, or use our applicable [platform UI features](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform).

## Drill down into interaction details [#breakdown-table]

To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the <DNT>**Breakdown table**</DNT> link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate <DNT>**custom**</DNT>.

For each traced method, the interaction breakdown table shows:

* Thread type (foreground or background)
* Class and method name
* Percentage of total execution time spent in this method
* Average number of calls to this method per interaction
* Overall average execution time of each call to this method

## Analyze the interaction trace timeline [#interactions-timeline]

Each interaction trace period record a single traces until a new interaction begins. To view the trace timeline for your mobile app:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Slowest traces**</DNT> table, select the <DNT>**Activity**</DNT> or <DNT>**Duration**</DNT> link for the trace.

The trace timeline also provides device metrics to help you gain insight into your app's device-level data. The system usage metrics show how your app is interacting with your end users' devices, including database, CPU, and memory.

Here are some additional actions you can take:

* To view the on-device usage metrics, mouse over the timeline.
* To drill down into detailed information, select any location on the timeline.
* To help provide context for the data, click <DNT>**Previous interaction**</DNT>.
