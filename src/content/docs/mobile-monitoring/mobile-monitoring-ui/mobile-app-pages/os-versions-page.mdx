Curious how your app is performing on the latest Android or iOS release? Use our OS versions page to analyze and compare app performance between different releases (including major and minor releases), and view metrics like number of active devices, network failures, and HTTP request time.

## View the OS versions page [#view-os-versions-page]

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. In the left-hand menu, click <DoNotTranslate>**OS versions**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Drill down into specific metrics [#drill-down]

If you see a data spike, such as an increase in interaction time, click and drag the time picker. The page will refresh and expand into that segment of time so you can see exactly what happened.

## Create alerts [#create-alerts]

Now that you've got visibility into your app's performance, it's time to set up alerts for key performance changes. 

Simply click into a metric, then from the chart menu, click <DoNotTranslate>**Create alert condition**</DoNotTranslate> and follow the steps in the UI.
