The OS versions page for mobile monitoring provides performance details about the top operating system versions hosting your mobile application, such as iOS and Android. Charts compare the OS versions by:

* HTTP request time
* Network failures
* Requests per minute
* Active devices

From here you can drill down into details by a major or minor OS version (for example, iOS 8, iOS 7.1.1, Android 4.2.2).
