Understanding the health of your mobile app empowers your team to make smarter and more efficient choices with each new version. To track changes in your mobile app, New Relic provides version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. Here you can compare performance across the most recent versions of your mobile app using the version trends report. You have access to the key data points you need to analyze the impact of improvements, fixes, and degradations for each version. You can compare usage, adoption, and technical metrics.

## Requirements

To collect version trend information for your mobile app, make sure your agent version is:

* New Relic mobile agent for [Android agent v6.5.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/) or higher
* New Relic mobile agent for [iOS agent v7.0.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/) or higher

## View version trends [#view-version-trends]

To view the version trends report go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Version trends**.

   <img
     title="Mobile version trends UI"
     alt="A screenshot of the version trends UI that shows several app versions and the performance differences as percentages between them"
     src={mobileVersionTrendsSummary}
   />
   
Each new version of your mobile app is compared against the previous version. For a selected time period, the version trends report compares the performance increases and decreases of your app versions against the previous version.

For example, use the timepicker dropdown to select default or custom time periods to query:

   <img
     title="Mobile version trends time picker"
     alt="This is a screenshot of the time picker within the version trends UI. Dates selected are October 23rd through October 24th."
     src={mobileCustomTimeFrame}
   />

## Understanding version trend details [#details]

After you launch a new version of your mobile app you can use the version trends report to compare performance and user adoption. You can also measure the health of your app through key metrics like crash rates and HTTP errors.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="adoption"
    title="Critical user adoption metrics"
  >
    You can compare different versions to measure user adoption.

    * **App launches:** count of the number of times the application has been launched by a user
    * **Total users:** count of unique active devices
    * **Upgrades:** count of unique active devices that were upgrades from a previous app version
    * **New installs:** count of unique active devices who performed a new install of this app
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="kti"
    title="Key technical metrics"
  >
  These metrics help you measure the health of your app:

    * **Crash rates:** the percentage of all app sessions that crashed
    * **HTTP errors:**  HTTP errors are an HTTP request that have a status codes between 400-499
    * **Network failures:** a network failure is an HTTP request that results in no response
    * **Requests:** the average number of network requests made per app session
    * **Response time:** the average server response time as seen from the appâ€™s perspective
    * **Memory usage:** memory occupied by the app on the active device
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Query version trend data [#insights]

When querying with [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information:

* To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use `install`. This attribute records `true` for new installations.
* To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use `upgradeFrom`.

To use these attributes, make sure your version of our [Android agent](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/) or [iOS agent](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/) supports them.
