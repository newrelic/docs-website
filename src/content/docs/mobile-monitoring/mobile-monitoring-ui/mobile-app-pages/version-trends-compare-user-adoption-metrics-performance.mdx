Mobile monitoring provides a **Version trends** report with metrics to compare usage, adoption, and performance across the most recent versions of your mobile app. This helps mobile app development managers and their teams to compare up to five production versions from a single page and to analyze the impact of improvements, fixes, and degradations for each.

You can view version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. You can also enable [email notifications](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/review-version-trends-email-reports).

## Requirements

If you see this message in the **Version trends** UI: "No adoption data is available for this version because it is running an older agent," this indicates the mobile app wasn't using the New Relic mobile agent version that collects install/upgrade count data.

To collect version trend information for your mobile app, make sure your agent version is:

* New Relic mobile agent for [Android version 5.3.3](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/) or higher
* New Relic mobile agent for [iOS version 5.3.4](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/) or higher

## View version trend data in UI [#view-version-trends]

To view the **Version trends** report:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Version trends**.
2. Select the **Launch** time period to compare versions by day (default), week, or month, or view all available data.

3. Review the [version trend details](#details) to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. For additional suggestions about how to interpret the data, review the [examples](#examples).
4. Optional: To configure email settings, see [Email reports](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/mobile-monitoring-email-notifications#version-trends).

## View version trend details [#details]

Each version includes several metrics to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="performance"
    title="Performance across releases"
  >
    An important feature is comparison of app performance across releases, based on data collected when each version was at its peak of popularity. You can select four different views of data for when each version was in production, including:

    * Launch day (default)
    * Launch week
    * Launch month
    * All available data for the version

    This quickly helps you see whether the adoption and performance characteristics of an app's version are better or worse than others.

    Summary mobile app information for each release includes:

    * **Versions:** Versions of your app release, sorted by date of highest popularity
    * **Sessions:** Count of mobile app sessions showing usage of each release
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="adoption"
    title="Critical user adoption metrics"
  >
    You can compare different versions to see how successfully they have been adopted by users.

    * **Total users:** Count of unique users (devices) active
    * **Upgrades:** Count of unique users (devices) active that were upgrades from a previous app version
    * **New installs:** Count of unique users (devices) active who performed a new install of this app

    Upgrades and new installs combine to reveal adoption in the form of total unique installs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="kti"
    title="Key technical indicators"
  >
    Key technical performance indicators include stability, network health, other app or server problems, and memory usage:

    * To track stability, the UI shows the **Crash rate** as the percentage of all app sessions that crashed.
    * To understand whether networking problems are originating from the app, network, or server, the UI shows the percentage of server responses that returned an HTTP error code (**HTTP errors**) and the percentage of network calls that failed to receive a response (**Network failure**).
    * To identify other problems from the app or server, the UI shows the average number of network requests made per app session (**Requests per session**) and the average server **Response time** as seen from the appâ€™s perspective.
    * To compare improvements or problems with **Memory** usage, the first four versions include metrics indicating better (green) or worse (red) performance than the previous version's.

## Interpret version trend data (examples) [#examples]

Here are some examples of how to interpret some of the data that appears.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Example**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Improvements
      </td>

      <td>
        A new release with faster response time than previous releases may indicate that development efforts were successful.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Problems
      </td>

      <td>
        A new release with a spike in crashes, as compared to the previous releases, may indicate that a change introduced in the library or framework is not handling the new scenario or code path properly.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        User adoption
      </td>

      <td>
        A new release with low numbers of upgrades or new installs may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may help justify a new or changed focus in marketing the new release.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Release maintenance
      </td>

      <td>
        An older release with continued higher numbers of total users also may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may result in unanticipated costs for continued support, or delays in deprecating the old version and its back-end APIs.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Query version trend data [#insights]

When querying with [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information:

* To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use `install`. This attribute records `true` for new installations.
* To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use `upgradeFrom`.

To use these attributes, make sure your version of our [Android agent](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/) or [iOS agent](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/) supports them.
