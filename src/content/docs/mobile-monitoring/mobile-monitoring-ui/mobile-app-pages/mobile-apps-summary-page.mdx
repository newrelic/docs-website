The **Summary** page provides an operational snapshot of your mobile app. All charts, tables, and statistics show data for the currently selected [time window](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data) and application version. 

## Key app metrics [#dsahboard-metrics]

The Summary page captures five key app metrics:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Application crash rate**
      </td>

      <td>
        Plots the number of crashed sessions over time as a percentage of all sessions, broken out by app version. The average crashed session percent, total number of crashes, and count of unique users affected by those crashes during the time window is shown in the upper right.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **App launches**
      </td>

      <td>
        Charts the number of app session launches monitored over the time window.

        New Relic defines a mobile session as beginning when an app appears on screen and ending when the app is sent to the background.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **HTTP errors / network failures**
      </td>

      <td>
        Charts the number of network requests that result in a **http status code error** (400 or higher) as a percentage of all completed requests, and the number of **failed network calls** (for example, a connection failure) as a percentage of completed requests.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **HTTP response time**
      </td>

      <td>
        Charts the average response time of all completed http requests from each of the top five hosts your app communicates with.

        Top five is calculated based on count of completed requests to each host.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Frequent interactions**
      </td>

      <td>
        Presents key performance metrics for each of the five most commonly executed Interactions in your app.
      </td>
    </tr>
