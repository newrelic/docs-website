The Devices page for mobile monitoring provides performance details about the top devices using your mobile application, such as iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Android Tablet, etc. Charts compare the devices by:

* Interaction time
* HTTP request time
* Error rates and network failures
* Active user sessions

From here you can drill down into details by a specific model (for example, iPhone 6, 6S, 7).
