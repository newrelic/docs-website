New Relic's mobile monitoring UI includes a mobile app index that shows a list of your monitored apps and important summary information about them.

## View your list of mobile apps [#menu]

To see the mobile apps index, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and click **Mobile**.

The index of available mobile apps includes a colored health status indicating:

* Green = Normal
* Yellow = Warning
* Red = Critical
* Gray = Not reporting data

## Standard menu functions [#functions]

To view details for a specific app, select it from the index. Here are some other functions available from the index:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        View the app's status
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over the mobile app's colored health status indicator. If the health status indicator is gray and no data is being reported, you likely need to finish [installing mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring-installation/).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Monitor another app
      </td>

      <td>
        Select **Add more**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        See the app's metadata
      </td>

      <td>
        To see the app's metadata, including its app ID, entity GUID, and more, click the <Icon name="fe-tag"/> icon next to the application name.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
