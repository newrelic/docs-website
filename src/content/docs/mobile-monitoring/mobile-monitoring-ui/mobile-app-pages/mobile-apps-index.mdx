New Relic's mobile monitoring UI includes a mobile app index that shows a list of your monitored apps and important summary information about them.

## View your list of mobile apps [#menu]

To see the mobile apps index, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All entities > Mobile applications**. Use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) to access all your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. 

Alternatively, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile**.

The index of available mobile apps includes a colored health status indicating:

* Green = Normal
* Yellow = Warning
* Red = Critical
* Gray = Not reporting data
