New Relic's mobile monitoring provides several emailed reports, including:

* [Release notifications](#version-trends) (aka version trend emails)
* [Crash report emails](#crash-reports)

## Version trend emails [#version-trends]

New Relic's mobile monitoring provides you with a [**Version trends** UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/version-trends-compare-user-adoption-metrics-performance). You can also enable version trend emails (aka release notifications). These reports provide a convenient communication tool to share, track, and review your app's progress, adoption, and other trends. Each email includes a link to the **Version trends** UI to see more details.

We email you reports at regular intervals:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Time period**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Day after release
      </td>

      <td>
        The day after a new release launches, the report provides data about crash rates, HTTP errors, and network failures. This can help you quickly understand if the release is causing any major issues.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Week and month after release
      </td>

      <td>
        One week and one month later, the numbers and percentages will show whether new users are installing the app and existing users are upgrading to this version. This can help you analyze the success of specific app versions and your promotional efforts around them.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Occasional followup emails
      </td>

      <td>
        Over time you can evaluate your development efforts. This can help you determine whether each release is maintaining or improving the stability and performance of your app. This in turn can help you to identify any changes needed to support or enhance your app.

### Edit version trend email settings [#version-trend-ui]

How you configure your version trend email settings depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) you're on.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To quickly check your user model: go to the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and click **User preferences**. If you see mobile email settings there, you're on our original user model.

## Crash report emails [#crash-reports]

When your mobile app has a new kind of crash, you want to know what went wrong so you can prevent that type of error in the future. With crash report emails, you are notified when a unique crash is detected.

How you configure your crash report email settings depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) you're on.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To quickly check your user model: go to the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and click **User preferences**. If you see mobile email settings there, you're on our original user model.
