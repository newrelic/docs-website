<Callout title="Preview feature">
We're still actively developing Mobile Session Replay, but we're excited for you to try this powerful new feature! This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our pre-release policies.
</Callout>

Mobile Session Replay provides a video replay of what the end user saw on their phone or tablet when using your native app, synchronized alongside the telemetry data your application generated during the user's session. This enables quick determination of the impact to your users of errors, performance, and interface design. It also reduces the reliance on reproducing issues locally in order to troubleshoot them.

## How mobile session replay works [#how-it-works]

Understanding how Mobile Session Replay works helps you make informed decisions about privacy settings and troubleshooting.

When a user launches your app, the Mobile agent makes a call to New Relic servers to check whether Session Replay is enabled, and if so, what the sampling rates and privacy settings are. The agent resolves the sampling decision and starts capturing replay data.

Unlike Browser Session Replay, mobile apps don't have a DOM that can be captured and recreated. Instead, the Mobile agent monitors the view lifecycle and transforms the viewport into HTML. Your masking settings are applied to the HTML reproduction of the viewport which is then serialized to JSON and stored client-side until a harvest is triggered every 1 minute, when the payload is gzipped and sent to New Relic.

If the application crashes or hangs unexpectedly, the data that was collected between the last successful harvest cycle and the unexpected app exit is stored client-side until the next app launch, when the Mobile agent will attempt to restore and harvest the orphaned data. Due to how iOS and Android handle unexpected exits, we can't always recover all data after unexpected app exits.

When a replay is viewed in the New Relic UI, the JSON is fetched from NRDB and deserialized back to a stream of HTML updates which constitutes the "video" being played back in your web browser.

Due to the transformation from native platform view frameworks into HTML, Mobile Session Replays are generally accurate but not pixel perfect. We will continually be working to improve the accuracy of replays.

## Set up mobile session replay [#setup]

Enabling Session Replay, sampling rates, and most privacy settings are managed server-side on the Application Settings page in New Relic so updates are not dependent on the deployment and adoption of a new app version. Only some types of masking overrides need to be managed in your code.

### Step 1: Enable mobile session replay [#enable]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Mobile](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. In the left-hand menu, click **Settings > Application**.
4. Toggle on **Mobile Session Replay**.

  alt="Enable Mobile Session Replay"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-enable.webp"
/>

### Step 2: Configure sampling rates [#sampling]

<Callout variant="important">
**Sessions with errors** sampling is not yet supported in the Limited Preview of Mobile Session Replay. This documentation is provided so you can prepare for when it becomes available later in the preview period.
</Callout>

Define the sampling rates to control how often session replays are captured. Sampling rates can be as small as one millionth of a percent for high throughput apps. There are two sampling rates available:

- **Total user sessions**: Records a random sample of all user sessions.
- **Sessions with errors**: Records a random sample of sessions where at least one error occurs. The agent buffers a sliding window of data for up to 30 seconds on the client-side, and if an error occurs, the buffered data is harvested and the remainder of the session is recorded. If an error doesn't occur, the replay is never harvested.

  alt="Define sampling rates Mobile Session Replay"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-sampling.webp"
/>

### Step 3: Configure privacy settings [#privacy]

Protecting user privacy is critical when recording session replays. The default settings secure sensitive information by masking all text and images, but you may adjust them to fit your specific privacy needs. 

All masking is done client-side so sensitive information never leaves the end-user's device. This section shows you how to use masking strategies, modes, and override rules to adhere to your privacy standards while still keeping session replays useful for improving your user experience and diagnosing issues.

## Privacy and masking [#privacy-masking]

Choose the masking strategy that best fits your privacy requirements.

### Masking strategies [#masking-strategies]

We offer two masking strategies:

#### Default masking strategy [#default-strategy]

The default masking strategy ensures that no private or sensitive data is collected. We mask all text with asterisks (e.g., "hello" becomes "\*\*\*\*\*") and block all images by replacing them with placeholders of the same size. 

With this strategy, masking modes are not configurable and masking overrides (like inline `nr-unmask` tags) are not enforced, ensuring maximum privacy protection.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay default masking strategy"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay default masking strategy"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-default.webp"
/>

#### Custom masking strategy [#custom-strategy]

Use a custom masking strategy if you need any text to be readable and images to be displayed. A custom masking strategy is composed of masking modes and override rules that you configure based on your needs.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay masking strategies"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking strategies"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-strategy.webp"
/>

### Masking modes [#masking-modes]

When using the custom masking strategy, masking modes designate the standard masking behavior for different content types. These modes can be overridden by specific rules.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay masking modes"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking modes"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-mode.webp"
/>

#### Mask user input text [#mask-user-input]

When enabled, each character typed into your application is replaced by an asterisk (e.g., "hello" becomes "\*\*\*\*\*"). When disabled, text typed into your application will be readable in the replay (e.g., "hello" remains "hello"). 

**Note:** Password input types will never be unmasked regardless of this setting.

**Default:** Enabled in the custom masking strategy.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay masking user input text"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking user input text"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-input.webp"
/>

#### Mask application text [#mask-app-text]

When enabled, each character displayed by your application is replaced by an asterisk (e.g., "First name" becomes "\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*"). When disabled, text displayed by your application will be readable in the replay (e.g., "First name:" remains "First name:").

**Default:** Enabled in the custom masking strategy.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay masking application text"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking application text"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-application.webp"
/>

#### Mask images [#mask-images]

<Callout variant="important">
Minimum agent versions that support image capture:
- iOS agent v7.5.10 (released September 15th, 2025)
- Android agent v7.6.9 (released September 15th, 2025)
- React Native agent v1.5.10 (released September 15th, 2025)
</Callout>

When enabled, all images are replaced by a placeholder of the same dimensions. When disabled, images are compressed, base64 encoded, and sent to New Relic in the gzipped replay payload.

To reduce network traffic and your New Relic data consumption costs, all captured images are aggressively compressed client-side, resulting in lower quality images in the replay than what your users actually saw.

**Default:** Enabled in the custom masking strategy.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay masking images"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking images"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-images.webp"
/>

#### Hide user taps and swipes [#hide-interactions]

When enabled, taps or swipes on your application aren't captured. When disabled, taps are represented by a gray circle and swipes with a red line so you can see which components users are interacting with in your app. 

**Note:** The operating system keyboard and the taps and swipes on it are never captured in replays.

Masking text is generally recommended over hiding taps and swipes, but may be necessary if your app has an integrated pin pad or other feature where taps or swipes may reveal sensitive data.

**Default:** Disabled in the custom masking strategy.

## Advanced masking configuration [#advanced-masking]

Use masking overrides when you want specific parts of your application to have different masking settings than your specified masking modes. For example, if the majority of your application doesn't have sensitive data, you can set your modes to unmask and specify overrides to only mask the parts of your application that contain sensitive data.

### Masking override methods [#masking-overrides]

We offer three ways to create masking override rules:

#### Inline attributes [#inline-attributes]

Inline masking overrides are applied in your code by tagging the component you want masked or unmasked. You'll need to deploy a new version of your app and have users adopt it for updates to apply, so they are best used when you want the oversight of your change control process to manage masking changes.

      **SwiftUI**
      
      Use `NRConditionalMaskView` to wrap content that should have specific masking behavior. This SwiftUI component provides fine-grained control over data masking in session replay.

      **Requirements:**
      - iOS 16.0+
      - Swift 5.0+

      **Import:**
      ```swift
      import SwiftUI
      import NewRelic
      ```

      **Basic usage:**
      ```swift
      // Mask all text content within this view
      NRConditionalMaskView(maskApplicationText: true) {
          VStack {
              Text("This text will be masked in session replay")
              Text("This text will also be masked")
          }
      }
      ```

      **Unmask content:**
      ```swift
      // Explicitly unmask content (useful when parent views have masking enabled)
      NRConditionalMaskView(maskApplicationText: false) {
          Text("This text will be visible in session replay")
      }
      ```

      **Identifier-based masking:**
      ```swift
      // Use an identifier to control masking via API or dashboard settings
      NRConditionalMaskView(sessionReplayIdentifier: "unmasked-section") {
          Text("This text masking is controlled by the identifier")
      }
      ```

      **Parameters:**
      - `maskApplicationText`: When `true`, masks all text content within the view. When `false`, ensures text is visible. When `nil`, inherits from parent.
      - `maskUserInputText`: When `true`, masks user input fields within the view. When `false`, shows input content. When `nil`, inherits from parent.
      - `maskAllImages`: When `true`, masks all images within the view. When `false`, shows images. When `nil`, inherits from parent.
      - `maskAllUserTouches`: When `true`, masks user touch interactions within the view. When `false`, shows touch events. When `nil`, inherits from parent.
      - `sessionReplayIdentifier`: Optional identifier to control masking via `addSessionReplayMaskedAccessibilityIdentifier`, `addSessionReplayUnmaskedAccessibilityIdentifier`, or through the New Relic application dashboard.
      - `activated`: When `false`, disables masking functionality entirely for this view. Default is `true`.

      **Advanced example - Mixed masking in a form:**
      ```swift
      struct RegistrationForm: View {
          @State private var firstName = ""
          @State private var email = ""
          @State private var password = ""
          
          var body: some View {
              VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 16) {
                  // Public form labels remain visible
                  NRConditionalMaskView(maskApplicationText: false) {
                      Text("Create Your Account")
                          .font(.title)
                  }
                  
                  // Personal information
                  NRConditionalMaskView(sessionReplayIdentifier: "personal-info") {
                      TextField("First Name", text: $firstName)
                      TextField("Email", text: $email)
                  }
                  
                  // Highly sensitive - mask everything
                  NRConditionalMaskView(sessionReplayIdentifier: "password-section") {
                      SecureField("Password", text: $password)
                      Text("Password must be at least 8 characters")
                  }
                  
                  Button("Sign Up") {
                      // Handle registration
                  }
              }
              .padding()
          }
      }
      ```

      **UIKit**
      
      Add or append `nr-mask` or `nr-unmask` to the `accessibilityIdentifier` of the `UIView` to be masked or unmasked. Appending an existing identifier is helpful if you need to maintain unique identifiers for automated testing, but you will likely need to update your tests after changing the values.

      Example of adding an `accessibilityIdentifier`:

      ```swift
      let myView = UIView()
      myView.accessibilityIdentifier = "nr-mask"
      ```

      Example of appending to an existing `accessibilityIdentifier`:

      ```swift
      let myView = UIView()
      myView.accessibilityIdentifier = "someExistingId.nr-unmask"
      ```
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="android">
      **Jetpack Compose**
      
      Use Modifier extensions to control masking behavior in Jetpack Compose.

      Example:

      ```kotlin
      // Mask a composable
      Text(
          text = "Sensitive information",
          modifier = Modifier.nrMask()
      )

      // Unmask a composable
      Text(
          text = "Public information",
          modifier = Modifier.nrUnmask()
      )
      ```

      **XML layouts**
      
      Add an `nr-mask` or `nr-unmask` tag to the views or components to be masked or unmasked.

      Example: 

      ```xml
      <EditText
          android:id="@+id/editTextEmail"
          android:layout_width="390dp"
          android:inputType="text"
          android:tag="nr-mask"
          android:importantForAutofill="no" />

      <EditText
          android:id="@+id/editTextEmail"
          android:layout_width="390dp"
          android:inputType="text"
          android:tag="nr-unmask"
          android:importantForAutofill="no" />
      ```
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="reactnative">
      Use the `<NewRelic.Mask>` and `<NewRelic.Unmask>` components to mask or unmask views or components.

      Example:

      ```jsx
      <View>
        <NewRelic.Mask>
          <Text>Sensitive information</Text>
        </NewRelic.Mask>
      </View>

      <View>
        <NewRelic.Unmask>
          <Text>Non-sensitive information</Text>
        </NewRelic.Unmask>
      </View>
      ```
    </TabsPageItem>
  </TabsPages>
</Tabs>

#### Local API methods [#local-api]

Local API method masking overrides are also applied in your code within the New Relic agent configuration. They are useful when the targeted views already have unique identifiers and you want to manage them in a centralized list instead of tagging each view individually throughout your code.

    <TabsPageItem id="ios">
      **SwiftUI**
      
      For SwiftUI views, use the `sessionReplayIdentifier` parameter in `NRConditionalMaskView` along with these methods:

      - `addSessionReplayMaskedAccessibilityIdentifier`
      - `addSessionReplayUnmaskedAccessibilityIdentifier`

      Example:

      ```swift
      // In your app initialization
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskedAccessibilityIdentifier("sensitive-section")
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskedAccessibilityIdentifier("public-section")

      // In your SwiftUI views
      NRConditionalMaskView(sessionReplayIdentifier: "sensitive-section") {
          Text("This will be masked")
      }

      NRConditionalMaskView(sessionReplayIdentifier: "public-section") {
          Text("This will be visible")
      }
      ```

      **UIKit**
      
      Mask or unmask views by adding their `class` or `accessibilityIdentifier` to the following methods:

      - `addSessionReplayMaskViewClass`
      - `addSessionReplayUnmaskViewClass`
      - `addSessionReplayMaskViewAccessibilityIdentifier`
      - `addSessionReplayUnmaskViewAccessibilityIdentifier`

      Example:

      ```swift
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewClass("SecureLabel")
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskViewClass("UnsecureLabel")
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewAccessibilityIdentifier("login")
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskViewAccessibilityIdentifier("editTextEmail")
      ```
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="android">
      **Jetpack Compose**
      
      For Jetpack Compose, you can use the same methods as XML layouts to target composables by their test tags or class names.

      Example:

      ```kotlin
      // In your application initialization
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewTag("sensitive-data")
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskViewTag("public-data")

      // In your composables
      Text(
          text = "Sensitive information",
          modifier = Modifier.testTag("sensitive-data")
      )

      Text(
          text = "Public information",
          modifier = Modifier.testTag("public-data")
      )
      ```

      **XML layouts**
      
      Mask or unmask views by adding their `class` or `android:tag` to the following methods:

      - `addSessionReplayMaskViewClass`
      - `addSessionReplayUnmaskViewClass`
      - `addSessionReplayMaskViewTag`
      - `addSessionReplayUnmaskViewTag`

      Example: 

      ```java
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewTag("login");
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskViewTag("editTextEmail");
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayUnmaskViewClass("android.widget.Button");
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewClass("android.widget.TextView");
      NewRelic.addSessionReplayMaskViewClass("com.yourpackagename.CustomView");

#### Server-side rules [#server-side-rules]

<Callout variant="important">
Minimum agent versions that support server-side rules:
- iOS agent v7.5.10 (released September 15th, 2025)
- Android agent v7.6.9 (released September 15th, 2025)
- React Native agent v1.5.10 (released September 15th, 2025)
</Callout>

Server-side masking rules allow you to retroactively patch masking mistakes in app versions that have already been released. They take immediate effect on all new session starts without requiring an app update.

Rules consist of three components:
- **Type**: Determines whether matching components should be masked or unmasked
- **Identifier**: Specifies how you want to target elements (e.g., by class, tag, etc.)
- **Value**: The value of the selected identifier the rule will apply to

For example, a rule to `Mask` `class` `android.widget.EditText` would mask all user-editable text fields in an Android app.

<img

  alt="Mobile Session Replay masking override"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-override.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  Define masking overrides for Mobile Session Replay in application settings.
</figcaption>

**To create a new rule:**
1. Go to **Mobile > [your entity] > Settings > Application > Session Replay**.
2. Scroll to **Override rules** and click **Add new override rule**.
3. Select the rule type (Mask or Unmask).
4. Choose the identifier you want to use to target components.
5. Input the value of the identifier you want the rule to apply to.
6. Click **Add rule**.

The new rule is added to the Override Rules table and will be enforced on all new sessions.

**To delete or edit a rule:**
1. Navigate to **Mobile > [your entity] > Settings > Application > Session Replay**.
2. Locate the rule you want to modify in the Override Rules table.
3. Click the `...` menu, then select **Delete** or **Edit**.

### Masking rule priority [#priority]

When several masking rules apply to one view or element, the following priority order determines which rule is applied:

1. **Strategy supersedes everything**

   If your masking strategy is `Default`, modes and overrides are not enforced.

   *Example:* If you have added inline `nr-unmask` attribute overrides in your code but the `Default` masking strategy is selected in settings, everything will still be masked.

2. **Overrides supersede modes**

   Modes determine the standard behavior when an override isn't present, so if an override is present, it will always take precedence over the mode.

   *Example:* If `Mask application text` mode is enabled and you add an inline `nr-unmask` attribute override to a view in your code, that view will be unmasked but every other view will be masked.

3. **Masking overrides supersede unmasking overrides**

   If a single view has both masking and unmasking overrides, it will always be masked.

   *Example:* If a view has an inline `nr-unmask` attribute override and an `nr-mask` server-side rule, the view will be masked. 

## View and analyze session replays [#view-analyze]

Once you start collecting session replays, they can be used to improve your digital experiences by identifying common patterns and areas where users experience friction. They're also helpful for quickly diagnosing and resolving issues by reviewing the steps users took before encountering errors or unexpected behavior.

### View replays on the Session Replay page [#replay-page]

The Session Replay page provides a list of all replays that were collected over your selected time period. By default, we filter the list to replays that lasted at least 5 seconds. The table provides helpful data points like error counts, and the filters allow you to narrow the list to sessions that will help solve your problem.

<img
  title="Mobile Session Replay listing page"
  alt="Mobile Session Replay listing page"
  src="/images/mobile-session-replay-listing.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  View and filter replays in **Mobile > [your_app] > Session replay**.
</figcaption>

For example, you can add a `countryCode` filter to see replays from a specific region to validate localization is working as expected, or a `deviceModel` filter to see replays from a specific model of phone that may have compatibility issues.

**To access the Session replay page:**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Mobile](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. Select your mobile app.
3. In the left-hand menu, scroll down and click **Session replay**.
4. Click on a row to view the replay.

### View replays with errors and performance issues [#errors-issues]

<Callout variant="important">
Replays in the Crashes and ANRs experiences are not yet supported in the Limited Preview of Mobile Session Replay. This documentation is provided for informational purposes only, to allow you to prepare for when they become available later in the preview period.
</Callout>

If a user encountered an issue while replay was being captured, a preview of the replay will be available on the error occurrence in the Crashes, Request errors, Handled exceptions, and ANRs experiences. 

The preview shows 5-10 seconds leading up to the issue and, for non-fatal issues, 5-10 seconds after it occurred. An icon is overlaid on the timeline to show you exactly when the error occurred in the replay. This allows you to quickly assess any user actions that may have caused the issue, as well as the severity of the impact to the end-user.

If the preview isn't enough to solve your problem, click the **View full session replay** button to see the entire session synchronized with the other telemetry data that was captured.

## Manage permissions and access [#permissions]

Mobile session replay has its own set of permissions so you can narrowly tailor who can view replays and update its settings. Users with any standard role can view replays, but only All product admins can modify Session Replay settings. Custom roles can be created for more control over user permissions.
