Mobile monitoring includes a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. To view the report: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Usage > Monthly uniques**.

## Monthly uniques report details [#details]

To see the total number of unique devices for any month, mouse over the month's bar in the chart. The current month's device count is a month-to-date value and does not indicate the full month's usage.

To drill down into detailed information, use any applicable [platform UI features](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform).

Unique users are used to calculate your [monthly usage](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/mobile-usage/mobile-subscription-usage-ui), which is used to calculate your subscription level.

## Device tracking [#tracking]

Mobile monitoring does not use hardware identifiers for unique install tracking.

* On iOS we use the IdentifierForVendor property. (Versions 5.3.4 and lower used the SecureUDID library.)
* On Android we generate a unique GUID when the application is installed.
