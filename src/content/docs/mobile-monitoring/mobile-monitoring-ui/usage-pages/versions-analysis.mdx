Mobile monitoring includes a comparative analysis of adoption and performance between versions of your application, including top versions by:

* Interaction time
* Active sessions
* Error rate

The **Versions** page also includes a table comparing each version by date created, average memory, average CPU, average sessions per minute, and average requests per minute (RPM) per active app. You can also drill down into additional details about a specific version.

  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > Usage > Versions:** The **Versions** analysis includes color-coded charts of mobile app usage, plus a table that summarizes mobile app versions and their averages for memory, CPU, active users, and network RPM (requests per minute).
</figcaption>

The **Versions** page provides a list of all versions of your app that have been detected, plus overview information on all versions active in the last seven days. To view the comparative analysis:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > Usage > Versions**.
2. To select the time period, use the [**time picker**](/docs/site/timepicker-setting-time-periods-to-view-data) below the New Relic menu bar.
3. Optional: Select the **Sort by** options.
4. To view details only for a specific **version**, select its name.

The **Versions** page provides a list of all versions of your app that have been active in the selected time window. Use any of New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/new-relic-user-interface) and [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information.

The details page provides further insight into how the selected version compares to a reference version (a recent or popular version), and the average of other versions of your app. Time series show the comparison across error rate, response time, active sessions, and memory usage.

To exit the details page, select the **Close** (**X**) button.

## How version numbers are obtained [#how-obtain-version]

The way that mobile monitoring obtains the version number varies by platform:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="android-ver-num"
    title="Android"
  >
    The [Android agent](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/android-installation-configuration) obtains the version information from the `android:versionName` property in the manifest.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ios-ver-num"
    title="iOS"
  >
    The iOS agent uses both `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion` properties to obtain the app version. The agent accesses those properties through iOS APIs. It does not obtain them by reading the `info.plist` file.
