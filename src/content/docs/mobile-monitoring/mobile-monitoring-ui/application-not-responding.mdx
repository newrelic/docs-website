In Android mobile apps, [Application Not Responding (ANR) errors](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr) are triggered when the main UI thread of an application is blocked for more than five seconds.

## How ANR errors are reported in New Relic [#anr-reporting]

Our Android agent reports ANR errors as [`MobileApplicationExit`](linktodatadictionary) events, which leverage Android’s [ApplicationExitInfo API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo) to monitor and report on the different causes for app termination. The agent reads the `ApplicationExitInfo` API on the next app launch and asynchronously sends `MobileApplicationExit` events to New Relic for each app exit in the history.

### Understanding ANR discrepancies between New Relic and Google Play Console [#new-relic-vs-google-play]

You might encounter variations in ANR counts and rates between New Relic and Google Play Console. This is due to fundamental differences in the data collection methods:

* Android version coverage:
    * New Relic focuses on ANRs from devices running Android 11 or higher.
    * Google Play Console captures ANRs across all Android versions.
* Device and app scope:
    * New Relic reports from devices with the New Relic agent installed, regardless of app source.
    * Google Play Console reports exclusively from certified devices with apps downloaded through the Play Store.

For more information, see the [Google Play documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals).

## View ANRs in New Relic [#view-anr-in-new-relic]

By default, our Android agent collects and reports ANR errors to New Relic. You can find ANR data in two places:
    * On the Summary page, there's a widget called <DoNotTranslate>**ANR rate**</DoNotTranslate> displaying the percentage of errors.
    * On the ANR page, where you can view a breakdown of error rates, groups of users affected, and attribute details.

To view the ANR page:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Click <DoNotTranslate>**Mobile**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Select an Android app.
4. In the left pane, click <DoNotTranslate>**ANR**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Filter by ANR groups [#filter]

The widgets on the ANR page are based on groups of ANRs. By default, ANRs are grouped by the `description` attribute, such as (ADD EXAMPLE). 

To change how ANRs are grouped (such as device type, app version, or a [custom attribute](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/collect-custom-attributes/)), click the <DoNotTranslate>**Group by**</DoNotTranslate> and select an attribute from the list. The ANR page will update to show data for the new ANR group.

## Chart: ANR rate [#anr-rate-chart]

The <DoNotTranslate>**ANR rate**</DoNotTranslate> chart to see at a glance if there are any unexpected spikes, dips or patterns with ANRs in general. 

For example, if you released a recent app version, the ANR rate chart shows the percentage of sessions that experienced errors over time as a percentage of all sessions, broken out by app version. The average ANR session percent is shown in the upper right.

## Chart: ANR rate by day [#anr-rate-by-day]

The <DoNotTranslate>**ANR rate by day**</DoNotTranslate> chart shows the percentage of unique users that experienced an ANR over time as a percentage of all unique users.

Note: Irrespective of the time period selected , this chart would show the average ANR rate for the last 28 days

## Chart: ANR occurences by importance [#anr-occurences]

The <DoNotTranslate>**ANR occurrences by importance**</DoNotTranslate> chart shows the distribution of ANRs by relative importance of the app’s process before termination due to an ANR. More information about an app’s process importance can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo#getImportance).

## ANR profiles [#anr-profiles]

ANR profiles shows the distribution of attributes across all your ANR occurrences helping you identify patterns to quickly narrow down / troubleshoot your issue

## Disable ANR monitoring [#disable-anr-monitoring]

If you need to disable ANR monitoring:

1. In New Relic, navigate to your mobile app.
2. In the left pane under <DoNotTranslate>**Settings**</DoNotTranslate>, click <DoNotTranslate>**Application**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Toggle the ANR setting OFF.
