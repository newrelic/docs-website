[Mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring) has an **HTTP requests** UI page that helps you better understand HTTP requests associated with your mobile app and how those network calls are affecting performance.

This document describes the Enterprise-level **HTTP requests** page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the [legacy HTTP requests page](#non-enterprise-http-requests).

## Find and use HTTP requests page [#find-page]

To view mobile monitoring's **HTTP requests** page:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests**.
2. Use our [standard page functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts.
3. Target specific request and response attributes by [grouping, sorting, and filtering](#groups-sort-filter) the data.

## Understand HTTP request data [#understand-data]

Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="response-time-chart"
    title="Response time chart"
  >
    The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="errors-network-failures-chart"
    title="HTTP errors and network failures chart"
  >
    This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the [**HTTP errors** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/network-errors-http-error-network-failure-analysis) for more detail on the errors and failures.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="total-requests-chart"
    title="Total requests"
  >
    Sort by **Total requests** to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For a description of the non-Enterprise **HTTP requests** UI page, see [Legacy HTTP requests](#non-enterprise-http-requests).

## Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests [#group-sort-filter]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways
      </td>

      <td>
        Make selections from the **Group by** and **Sort by** dropdowns. By default, the **HTTP requests** page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Filter for specific HTTP requests
      </td>

      <td>
        Select an HTTP request from the **Errors and failures** list and/or select multiple filters from the **Filter** dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        See or remove applied filters
      </td>

      <td>
        The filters you select are displayed next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the `X` icon on the filter you want to clear.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Change the time window
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a new time period from the time picker dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View information for a specific app version
      </td>

      <td>
        Using the **Versions** dropdown, select the version for which you want to see charts and lists.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## View and share HTTP request data [#insights]

To view any **HTTP requests** chart in Insights:

1. Select <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> for any chart.
2. Select **View query > View in Insights**.
3. Optional: Add the data to a dashboard, or [share it by using a permalink](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/share-your-data/permalink).
4. To delve deeper into your request data, query [`MobileRequest`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/insights-query-examples-new-relic-mobile#mobilerequest-examples) events and [attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-events-attributes#mobilerequest-attributes).

## View legacy HTTP requests UI page [#non-enterprise-http-requests]

Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different **HTTP requests** UI page:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="non-enterprise"
    title="View legacy HTTP requests UI"
  >
    To view your top five domains or drill down into details about specific HTTP requests:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests**.
    2. Optional: Select the **Sort by** and **Hide &lt; 1% throughput** options.
    3. To view or hide all requests made by your app, select **Expand all** or **Collapse all**.
    4. To view details for a specific host or HTTP request (including request time, average throughput, and data transfer), select its name.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="details"
    title="View legacy drill-down details"
  >
    Use any of New Relic's standard [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information. In addition, from the **HTTP requests** page, you can drill down into detailed information about specific requests, including:

    * Top five HTTP request times
    * Average throughput
    * Average data transfer

      To view legacy details: **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests > (select a request): > Switch to legacy requests**.
