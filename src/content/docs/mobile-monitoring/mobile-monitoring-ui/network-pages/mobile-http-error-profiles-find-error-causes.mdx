On the [HTTP errors UI page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/http-errors-network-failure-analysis), **HTTP error profiles** give you insight about potential causes of your HTTP errors.

## View HTTP error profiles [#view]

To view mobile monitoring error profiles:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile >** (select an app) **> More views > HTTP errors**.
2. To see HTTP error profile details: At the bottom of the HTTP errors UI page, select the **HTTP error profiles** tab above the table, then select an HTTP error profile to expand it.

## What are HTTP error profiles? [#about]

An **HTTP error profile** is a potentially meaningful correlation found between your HTTP error values (MobileRequestError events) when compared to successful HTTP requests (MobileRequest events). These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your HTTP errors.

The screenshot below shows an example of an HTTP error profile.

You can also [filter the data](#filter) used to generate HTTP error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes.

For an analysis of a specific HTTP error profile, see the [example HTTP error profile explanation](#example-profile).

## Filter HTTP error profile data [#filter]

To further filter the data used to generate HTTP error profiles and their comparison page views, use these [HTTP errors page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/http-errors-network-failure-analysis#group-sort-filters) features:

* **Time picker**: select a time range used to generate the data.
* **Filter**: use the filter to display only HTTP error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values.

## Example HTTP error profile explanation [#example-profile]

To help you better understand your own HTTP error profile data, this is an explanation of an example HTTP error profile's data. This HTTP error profile example has had a [filter](#filter) of `deviceType = iPhone 12` applied, so it is only showing HTTP error data from iPhone 12 devices.

Column explanations:

* The first column is the **Errors** column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to successful HTTP requests. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the **Other** category. In this example, the OS versions 6.0, 5.1, 7.0, and 7.1.1 make up 100% of the HTTP errors for Chrome users.
* The **Errors** column shows what percentage of MobileRequestError events have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all HTTP errors from the chosen [time range and filter set](#filter). In this example, a large percentage of HTTP errors are coming from Galaxy OS version 7.1.1. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show OS version 7.1.1 data.
* The **Requests** column shows what percentage of MobileRequest events (successful HTTP requests) have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 14% of the requests are made by users on OS version 6, but 24% of HTTP errors are generated by users with that version.
* The **Difference** column shows you the difference in percentage between the **Errors** column and the **Requests** column. In this example, the <Icon name="nr-caret-up"/>
  11% indicates that attribute is 11 percentage points higher for HTTP error events than for requests.
