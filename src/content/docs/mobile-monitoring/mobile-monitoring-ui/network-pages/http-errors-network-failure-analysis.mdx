Mobile monitoring's **HTTP errors** page helps you to better understand HTTP errors and network failures associated with your mobile app, to connect errors to services that are causing issues, and to share actionable data with your team:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Team member
      </th>

      <th>
        View the data on the HTTP errors page to...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Manager
      </td>

      <td>
        See a list of errors and failures so you can coordinate mobile app teams with backend teams and share the data they need to fix issues.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        QA engineer
      </td>

      <td>
        Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        DevOps engineer
      </td>

      <td>
        See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Mobile developer
      </td>

      <td>
        Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Support engineer
      </td>

      <td>
        View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues.
      </td>
    </tr>

## Find and use the HTTP errors page [#errors_ui_workflow]

There are two ways to get to the **HTTP errors** page:

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors**.
* From a mobile app's [Overview](/docs/mobile-apps/mobile-apps-dashboard) page in mobile monitoring, select the **HTTP errors/network failures** chart title link.

From the **HTTP errors** page, investigate HTTP request and network failures:

* Use any [standard page functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to look for trends in **Errors and failures** charts.
* Target specific types of errors and failures by [grouping, sorting, and filtering](#groups-sort-filters) the data.
* Find anomalies in your request errors with [HTTP error profiles.](/node/14906/revisions/275421/view#http-error-profiles)
* Select an error or failure to view [details](#summary) for it.

You can also define [NRQL alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) that are focused on error types for your critical services or [query your app data](#insights).

## Group, sort, and filter errors and failures [#group-sort-filters]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        If you want to do this...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures
      </td>

      <td>
        Make selections from the **Group by** and **Sort by** dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is **grouped by** request domain and **sorted by** errors and failures.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Filter for specific errors and network failures
      </td>

      <td>
        Select an error or failure from the **Errors and failures** list and/or select multiple filters from the **Filter** dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        See which filters you applied or remove filters
      </td>

      <td>
        The filters you select display next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the **X** next to the filter you want to clear.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Change the time window
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a new time period from the **Time picker** dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View information for one specific app version
      </td>

      <td>
        Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the **Versions** dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## HTTP error profiles

Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each [attribute](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute), the error profile includes:

* A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most
* A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors

This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions.

## View more details about a specific error [#error-summary]

To view details about an error or failure, select the **Request URL** link to be directed to the **Error summary** page. From the **Error summary** page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and **Response** body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL.

## View and share error data with query builder [#insights]

To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the **HTTP errors/requests** page:

1. Select <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
   for any chart.
2. Select **View query**.

From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and [share it via a permalink](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#share).

To dig deeper into the error data, [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) for the following events and attributes:

* [`MobileRequestError`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-examples/insights-query-examples-mobile#mobilerequesterror-examples) events and [attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-events-attributes#mobilerequesterror-attributes)
* [`MobileRequest`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/insights-query-examples-new-relic-mobile#mobilerequest-examples) events and [attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-events-attributes#mobilerequest-attributes)

## View legacy HTTP errors UI page [#non-enterprise-http-requests]

Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different **HTTP Errors** UI page:

The **Errors** page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example:

* Secure connection failed
* Timed out
* Cannot find host
* Not connected to Internet
* Cannot connect to host

## View the Errors page [#dashboard]

To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors**.
2. To change the view to errors or failures, select the **Sort by** option.
3. To hide low-usage hosts, select the **Hide &lt; 1% throughput** option.
4. To limit information to a specific [version](/docs/mobile-monitoring-ui/versions) of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the **Versions** menu or the [**time picker**](/docs/site/timepicker-setting-time-periods-to-view-data) below the menu bar.
5. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name.

Use any of our standard [user interface functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/new-relic-user-interface) to drill down into detailed information.

## Error trace details [#trace]

Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace.

To view details about an error trace on the **Errors** page, select its request URL link. From here you can:

* View the response body.
* Share the error details with others by email.
* Delete or hide the error.

The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's [Overview](/docs/mobile-apps/mobile-apps-dashboard) page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its **HTTP errors/network failures** title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this **Errors** page.

## View error data in query builder [#insights]

To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to [query and chart](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-examples/insights-query-examples-mobile#mobilerequesterror-examples) the `MobileRequest` events and attributes.

## Unknown errors or URL errors [#unknown_url]

The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, `Unknown` may appear in the mobile **Errors** page.

If you find `Unknown` in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com "Link opens in a new window").
