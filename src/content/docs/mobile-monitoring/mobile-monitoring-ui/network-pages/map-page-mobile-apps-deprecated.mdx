<Callout variant="important">
  The mobile **Maps** UI is deprecated since December 22, 2020. [Service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps) are available in the left navigation for each mobile entity, and they are a better way to visualize and customize representations of your architecture. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-browser-php-python-mobile-and-android-agents/123951).

Maps help you find performance problems for a mobile app or its services. This gives you a clear picture of your app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected.

## View a map of your mobile app services [#map_procedures]

To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Monitor > Service map**. For more information, see the [service maps documentation](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/how-use-service-maps).

If you need to use the deprecated mobile **Map** page, follow these steps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Map**.
2. To view [HTTP request details](/docs/mobile-monitoring-ui/http-requests-dashboard) for a service, select its name.
3. To view details for [an app monitored by APM](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview) that is related to the service, select the service's name below the associated hostname.
4. To view throughput details as a chart, select the icon or the `cpm` bar below the service's name.
5. To view detailed metrics for a service, mouse over the throughput chart.

The **Map** page for mobile monitoring gives an architectural view of your mobile app and the services it uses,
