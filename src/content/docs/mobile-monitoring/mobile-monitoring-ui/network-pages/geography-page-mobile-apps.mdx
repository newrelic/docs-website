The Geography page shows your mobile users' experience as a world view, including:

* Color-coded response times
* Network requests (calls per minute)
* Data transfer size
* Active devices
* Network failure rates

You can also drill down to detailed information about each country.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The <DoNotTranslate>**Geography**</DoNotTranslate> feature is not the same as the <DoNotTranslate>**Map**</DoNotTranslate> feature. The [<DoNotTranslate>**Map**</DoNotTranslate> page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/map-page-mobile-apps) shows an architectural view of the relationship between a mobile app and its related services.
