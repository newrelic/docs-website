The Geography page shows your mobile users' experience as a world view, including:

* Color-coded response times
* Network requests (calls per minute)
* Data transfer size
* Active devices
* Network failure rates

You can also drill down to detailed information about each country.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The **Geography** feature is not the same as the **Map** feature. The [**Map** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/map-page-mobile-apps) shows an architectural view of the relationship between a mobile app and its related services.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Geography**.
2. To change the information that appears (including response time, requests per minute, total transfer size, active devices, or network failure rate), select your choice from the **Sort by** menu.
3. To adjust the amount of information that appears, select **Hide &lt; 1% throughput**.
4. To view summary information about a location, mouse over any area in color on the map, or mouse over the country's name on the list.

To drill down into detailed information, use any applicable [platform UI features](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform).
