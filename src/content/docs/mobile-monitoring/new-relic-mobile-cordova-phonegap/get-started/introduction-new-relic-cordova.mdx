The official New Relic Cordova plugin for iOS and Android allows developers to easily embed the mobile agents into [Cordova applications](http://cordova.apache.org/). Written in JavaScript, the plugin automatically includes New Relic's native agents to provide [mobile monitoring and performance visibility](https://newrelic.com/mobile-monitoring).

## Features

The New Relic Cordova plugin will:

* Detect the platforms added to your Cordova application and apply the most recent release of the appropriate New Relic mobile agent ([Android](/docs/releases/android) or [iOS](/docs/releases/ios)).
* Add post-build scripts for uploading iOS symbolication files.
* Upload Android Proguard mapping files.
* Automatically instrument mobile applications built via Cordova.

For more information, see [New Relic Cordova Plugin on Github](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cordova-plugin).

## Compatibility and requirements [#prerequisites]

The New Relic Cordova plugin requires:

* Cordova 7.x or higher
* Node 6.0 or higher
* Cordova CLI tools
* An [Android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android) or [iOS](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html) Cordova platform for your project
* Mobile [application tokens](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/viewing-your-application-token)

Network requests are only recorded on iOS devices for webviews and native frameworks. Android only records native network calls.

Cordova will typically handle exceptions by default. Our Cordova plugin will record uncaught exceptions (crashes) that Cordova does not handle.

## Install the Cordova plugin [#install]

Before installing, make sure you have fulfilled the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for adding the Android or iOS platform to your Cordova project. Then follow these steps to install the Cordova plugin:

1. If you do not already have an account, [signup](https://newrelic.com/signup) (it's free).
2. If applicable, use separate application tokens for iOS and Android.
3. From your New Relic applications page, copy the application tokens for the Cordova platforms you are building on.
4. Change to your Cordova project directory, then add the plugin to your project with the Cordova command line tool. Use the `--variable` argument to pass application tokens to the plugin:

   ```
   # Install from github repository
   cordova plugin add https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cordova-plugin.git --variable IOS_APP_TOKEN="{ios-app-token}" --variable ANDROID_APP_TOKEN="{android-app-token}"
   ```
5. Deploy your app.
6. View your performance data from the [mobile monitoring UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui).

## Update the plugin [#update]

Easily update the New Relic Cordova plugin to the latest released version using the following command:

```
cordova plugin update
```

        For sessions longer than 10 minutes, events in the Interaction and Custom [event categories](#mobile-category) are sent to New Relic while the session is ongoing, and therefore do not have `sessionDuration` attributes. Events recorded near the end of the session will include the duration, as will the Session event category.
