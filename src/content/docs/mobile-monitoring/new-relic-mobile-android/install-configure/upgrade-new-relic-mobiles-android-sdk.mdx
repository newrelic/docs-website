To ensure you have the most current version of the Android agent, see the [Android agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes). Instructions to upgrade your Android app will vary, based on which version of the Android agent SDK you are currently using.

## Upgrade from Android SDK versions 2 or 3 [#android_upgrade_2]

If you have previously installed version 2 or 3 of the Android SDK: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Upgrade.**

## Upgrade Android SDK version 1 [#android_upgrade_1]

If you have previously installed version 1 of the Android SDK, follow these steps before upgrading to version 2 or higher.

        **Open your AndroidManifest.xml file, and remove the `NewRelicApplication` class.**

        When you first ran **nrandroid-setup**, the `NewRelicApplication` class was added to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This has been removed from the New Relic SDK and is no longer necessary.

        If you had an existing `Application` subclass and modified it to inherit from `NewRelicApplication`, update your subclass to inherit from `Application` instead.

        **Stop using `nrandroid-ant`.**

        Mobile monitoring no longer requires the custom Ant wrapper script for Android applications. Once you upgrade, simply use your standard build tools.

        If you modified an existing Maven configuration to invoke the mobile build steps, remove those modifications, and use the revised build instructions.
