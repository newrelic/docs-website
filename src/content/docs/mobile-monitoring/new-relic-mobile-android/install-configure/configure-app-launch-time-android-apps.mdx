<Callout variant="important">
  This feature is available for agent versions 6.9.0 and higher.
</Callout>

With the Android agent, you can report app launch time, also known as "cold time" and "hot time."

## Configure app launch time [#configure-app-launch-time]

To enable the Android agent to report app launch time, add the following to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>

    <!-- Make sure to provide unique authorities if applied to multiple apps on the same device -->
    <provider
    android:name="com.newrelic.agent.android.rum.contentprovider.NewRelicAppContentProvider"
    android:authorities="com.newrelic.android.agent.nrprovider.${applicationId}"
    android:initOrder="200"
    android:exported="false"/>
    
</application>
```

## View app launch time [#app-launch-time]

Your app launch time is reported with the metrics `AppLaunch/Cold` and `AppLaunch/Hot`. To track these launch time metrics:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Capabilities > Query builder**</DNT>.
2. Run a [NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-nrql-mode-query-data/), such as:
   ```sql
   SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value ) AS 'AppLaunch/Cold' FROM Metric WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'AppLaunch/Cold' AND entity.guid = 'YOUR_APP_TOKEN' SINCE 1664218800000 UNTIL 1664220600000 TIMESERIES
   ```
3. Click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT> and either add it to an existing dashboard or create a new one.

If no data appears, review your `logcat` output for errors.
