[Android Instant Apps](https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html) allow users to quickly use your applications without installation. With the Android agent [version 5.17.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5170) and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app.

Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to [install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-android-apps-gradle-android-studio). After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps.

## Terminology

This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin:

* **Module**: Any packaged class and/or resource collection
* **APK**: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes
* **Feature module**: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK

## Install the plugin [#install]

To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps:

1. First follow the steps in the [Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-android-apps-gradle-android-studio) documentation.
2. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file.
3. List the Android agent as a dependency.
4. Start the agent from each [Activity class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html) in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin).

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="build.gradle"
       title="Minimal build.gradle example"
     >
       ```
       apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]'

       apply plugin: ‘newrelic’

       dependencies {

           implementation "com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}"

       }
       ```
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
5. Review the considerations for [instrumentation](#instrument).

## Instrumentation [#instrument]

When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Instant apps and APKs**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Instrumentation
      </td>

      <td>
        * Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes.
        * The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call `NewRelic.start()` when the activity is created (as per normal instructions).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs
      </td>

      <td>
        Place the `newrelic.properties` file in the root (main) directory of the project.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## ProGuard and Dexguard support [#proguard]

The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where `minifyEnabled` is set to `true`. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent.

Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed.

<Callout variant="important">
  When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the [ProGuard and DexGuard configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-proguard-or-dexguard-android-apps) documentation.
</Callout>

## Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation [#troubleshooting]

If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps:

1. Build app with `debug` (`-d`, `--debug`) option, and capture the build log.
2. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms:

   * ```
     This appears to be an Instant App
     ```
   * ```
     BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a]
     ```
3. The agent will add an attribute named `'instantApp'` to the app's session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.
