If you need to monitor old versions of Android, you can use legacy versions of the Android agent:

* To support Android versions lower than 4.0, use version [5.19.1](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5191-0) or earlier of the Android SDK. This is referred to as the legacy version.
* To support Android 2.2 specifically, use version [4.244.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-24440) or earlier of the Android SDK.

**Recommendation:** If you don't need to monitor these legacy versions of Android, install or [upgrade to the latest version of the agent instead](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-android-sdk). Using the latest version will give you richer data about app performance, crashes, and interactions.

## Install with support for older Android version [#installation]

If you have previously installed a version of the Android SDK, follow the [steps before upgrading](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-android-sdk#android_upgrade_1) to the latest version. Then follow standard [installation and configuration procedures](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure) for the Android agent.
