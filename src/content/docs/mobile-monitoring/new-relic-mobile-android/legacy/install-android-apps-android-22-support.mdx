To support Android versions lower than 4.0, you must use version [5.19.1](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5191-0) or earlier of New Relic Mobile's Android SDK. This is referred to as the legacy version.

To support Android 2.2, you must use version [4.244.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-24440) or earlier of New Relic Mobile's Android SDK.

**Recommendation:** To make the most of New Relic Mobile's features and functionality, [upgrade to latest version](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-android-sdk) of New Relic Mobile's Android agent.
