## Problem [#problem]
After an app crash, no crash data appears in the New Relic UI. You may see logs indicating that the agent is unable to find the `buildId`, which is required for crashes to be processed on the New Relic side.

Here are console agent log messages that verify the issue:

* `Agent.getBuildId() was unable to find a valid build Id. Crashes and handled exceptions will not be accepted.`
* `Invalid null or empty build ID detected! Crash will be ignored by collector.`
* `ExceptionHelper: java.util.UUID:fromStringJava8(UUID.java:337) RandomUUID[java.lang.IllegalArgumentException] Invalid UUID string:`
* `Unable to get obfuscated flag in crash`

## Solution [#solution]
If you are using Android agent 7.x.x or higher and no crash data appears after an app crash, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're using these Gradle and AGP versions:

    * Gradle version 7.5 or higher
    * AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) version  7.4.2 or higher

2. Configure ProGuard rules: Double-check that proper ProGuard rules are added to your ProGuard configuration file. Refer to the [Configuring ProGuard Rules](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-proguard-or-dexguard-android-apps/) section in the setup documentation for guidance.
