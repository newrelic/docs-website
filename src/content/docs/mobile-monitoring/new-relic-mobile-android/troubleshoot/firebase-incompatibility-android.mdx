## Problem

Conflicts, crashes, or errors will show when both the New Relic Android agent and Google's [Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon) are included within an app.

Known errors:

* `java.lang.StackOverflowError`
* `java.lang.RuntimeException: An error occurred while executing doInBackground()`

## Solution

Our Android agent and FireBase PerfMon cannot be enabled at the same time. We recommend to only enable one or the other to avoid this issue.
