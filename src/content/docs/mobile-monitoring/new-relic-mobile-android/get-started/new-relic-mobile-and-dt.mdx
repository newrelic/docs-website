title: New Relic mobile monitoring with distributed tracing
---
New Relic mobile monitoring agents support distributed tracing, which lets you see how your mobile app activity connects to related services. 

## Requirements

Here's what you need to use distributed tracing with New Relic mobile:

    * Android agent version 6.0.0 or higher
    * XCFramework agent version 7.3.0

<Callout variant="tip">
Infinite Tracing is not yet available for mobile monitoring 
</Callout>

## How to set up distributed tracing

For mobile agents that support this feature, itâ€™s enabled by default. 

If you prefer to turn off distributed tracing, see the following:

    * [Android feature flag](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/api-guides/android-agent-configuration-feature-flags/)
    * [iOS feature flag](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/api-guides/ios-agent-configuration-feature-flags/#dt)

## Find data

Mobile spans appear in any [New Relic distributed tracing UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/additional-distributed-tracing-features-new-relic-one/) where those spans are part of a trace. 

Here are some tips for finding and querying data:

* You can find end-user-originating traces in any [New Relic One distributed tracing UI](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/additional-distributed-tracing-features-new-relic-one).
* In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the ![New Relic distributed tracing browser span icon](./images/mobile-icon.png "distributed-tracing-browser-span-icon.png") icon.
* To see a span's attributes, select [a span in the UI](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data#span-details).
* Spans are reported as [Span data](/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8337), and can be [queried in New Relic](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).
* Query tips:
  * Query by browser app name by setting `mobileApp.name` to the browser app name.
  * Query for traces containing at least one mobile app span with `mobileApp.name is not null`.
  * Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with `appName is not null`.
  * Query for traces containing both mobile and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-missing-trace-data#browser-data).
