metaDescription: 'Compatible build systems, OS versions, and more for the Android agent.'
---

Mobile monitoring is compliant with standard application stores, including Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and others. Before you [install and configure the mobile agent](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure) with your Android applications, follow these guidelines for compatibility and other requirements.

## Foreground monitoring [#foreground]

The Android agent only monitors your app while it is in the foreground. The agent does not monitor background services while the app is closed. For more information, see our [Mobile data privacy and security documentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/get-started/security-mobile-apps).

## Android compatibility [#compatibility]

Make sure your Android app meets these requirements:

        <Callout variant="important">
        `AndroidHttpClient` was removed from the SDK in version 23, and as such only supported in agent version `6.5.0` and below
        </Callout>

        Build with Android SDK Tools version 24 or higher and the following as appropriate:

        * Android Studio
        * Gradle 5.1.1
        * Gradle plugin 3.4
        * Proguard 5.0
        * DexGuard 8.0 through 9.x

        Your build's Android SDK Tools version must be compatible with your Android agent version:

        * **Android agent version 6.6.0 or higher** requires builds to be compiled with **Android SDK Tools version 24 or higher**.
        * **Android agent version 6.0.0 through 6.5.0** requires builds to be compiled with **Android SDK Tools version 21 or higher**.
        * **Android agent version 5.0.0 through 5.9.9** requires builds to be compiled with **Android SDK Tools version 14 or higher**.

            As of January 2021, our Android agent discontinued support for Android Gradle Plugin version 2. For more information, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-browser-php-python-mobile-and-android-agents/123951).

            As of May, 2022, Android Gradle plugin version 7.2.1 release breaks the transform API when used along with ASM API, and this has impacted New Relic Android agent functionalities. This issue has been fixed in [Android Gradle plugin version 7.2.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#7-2-0)

          Upgrade to the most recent version before installing the Android agent.

## Kotlin and Kotlin DSL [#kotlin]

You can also use [Kotlin projects with Gradle](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) and New Relic's Android agent.

### Kotlin DSL support by Android agent version [#Kotlin-DSL-support-by-Android-agent-version]

With the exception of incompatibilities noted with [Android Gradle Plugin](#agent-gradle), New Relic's Android agent is compatible with versions **1.3 - 1.4** of the Kotlin Gradle Plugin.

### Kotlin DSL support by AGP version [#kotlin-andoid-gradle]

Kotlin DSL support was officially added to Android Gradle Plugin in version 4.1, but many developers are already using it in place of Groovy.

## Unit testing not supported [#testing]

Our New Relic mobile agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. We do not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior.
