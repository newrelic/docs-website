## Guest blog posts [#guest-blog]

New Relic loves great blog content, and partners are often an essential source.

You're encouraged to write a guest blog post for [http://blog.newrelic.com](http://blog.newrelic.com).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="“why”"
    title="What's in it for you?"
  >
    It's a great opportunity for you to promote your company and the integration you've built. Our blog is popular reading for the New Relic community, and our customers are frequently among the fastest growing innovators.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="“how”"
    title="How does it work?"
  >
    You draft the post and supply screenshots and/or video as applicable. New Relic will edit, format, publish, and promote the post. You'll get credit as the author, and you can include a paragraph at the end mentioning your product.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="“content”"
    title="How do you create a great blog post?"
  >
    The goal is to be insightful, useful, thought provoking, smart, surprising, and entertaining—or at least some combination of those elements.

            Writing style
          </td>

          <td>
            * **Recommendation:** Write your blog post in the first person. New Relic's target audience includes developers, DevOps, IT ops, execs, marketers, and data scientists working with big data, but we have no problem attracting a wider readership than that. We want to intrigue them and help them do their jobs better and more passionately.
            * Passion and connection are essential. If you do not care about the topic you are blogging about or, more importantly, you do not appear to care about it, neither will the reader.

            Length
          </td>

          <td>
            A typical blog post runs approximately 500 words, but it may be longer or shorter if there is a good reason. Technical blog posts may run much longer, while posts with video may not need much text at all.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Content
          </td>

          <td>
            * Each post should focus on a single main idea. If you have a mashup of multiple ideas, consider breaking them up into a series of multiple, related posts.
            * Posts do not have to be based on the latest news, but they shouldn't pretend that old news is new. If you're writing about something that's not brand new, you need to acknowledge that and come up with a fresh take or new angle.
            * Posts should be fact based, and not mere opinion without a grounding in reality.
            * The magic is in the details. Posts should be grounded in specifics, not just general pronouncements. If you say something is bad, you need to describe why; for example, what can or did happen because of it. Similarly, if you suggest best practices, the more specific examples you provide, the better.

          <td>
            Links to outside content are encouraged, but just pointing to something on the web is not enough for a post, no matter how interesting the link is. You need to bring something unique to the post.
