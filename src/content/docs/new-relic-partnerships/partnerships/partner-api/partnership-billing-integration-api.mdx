New Relic's Partnership API includes functions to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers for New Relic accounts.

For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner.

<Callout variant="important">
  This information is for version 2 of the Partnership API. Use v2 for all new integrations. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2.

## Communication endpoint [#billing-communication]

Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and `PARTNER_ID`. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS.

* The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the **Settings** tab of New Relic's [Partner Portal](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/getting-started/using-partner-portal).
* The `PARTNER_ID` is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the `partner_external_identifier` parameter.

## Billing API [#billing-api-calls]

Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes:

* Customer subscription notification
* Invoice information notification

    To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this [URI](#billing-communication):

    ```
    https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json
    ```

    Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or [Admin user's API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/admins-api-key-partnerships). The Partnership API returns the results as JSON.
