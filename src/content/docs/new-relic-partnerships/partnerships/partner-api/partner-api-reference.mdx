This doc explains technical details about using the Partnership API. For an introduction and requirements, first read [Intro to Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/).

## Requirements [#requirements]

**The Partnership API is not available to your organization unless you're specifically instructed by your New Relic representative that you should use it.**

For requirements, see [Intro to Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/).

## Find your Partnership API key [#the-api-key]

The Partnership API requires that you authenticate with the [REST API key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#rest-api) that is specific to your [partnership owner account](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions#partner-owner) (you cannot use the other [REST API keys](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key)).

When using your Partnership API key with calls to [REST API (v2)](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2) endpoints that require the use of an **Admin user's API key**, see [Admin user's API Key and partnerships](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/admins-api-key-partnerships).

## Find your Partner ID [#partner-id]

The Partnership API also requires that you authenticate by providing a Partner ID specific to your partnership. This is unique from the [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) for your partnership owner account.

To obtain your Partner ID, go to your [partner admin console](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/getting-started/partnership-admin-console) and retrieve the partner ID number that is listed in your URL:

```
https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/â€‹$ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/partnerships/$PARTNER_ID
```

You must include the Partner ID as part of the base URL for the Partner API.

## Authenticate the API call [#api-passwords]

To authenticate to the Partner API when making an API call:

1. Add a request header labeled **x-api-key** and set its value to your **Partner API key**.
2. Include your **Partner ID** at the specified point in the request URI.

## Notes for partners who manage New Relic accounts [#initial-call]

For partners who manage New Relic accounts for their customers, the initial API call for all account-level interactions is to "create account." This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the `account_id`. All of the other calls in the Partnership API require the `account_id` as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the `account_id`, and associate it with the users' partner account record.

## Errors [#api-errors]

New Relic uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success and codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (for example, a required parameter was missing).
