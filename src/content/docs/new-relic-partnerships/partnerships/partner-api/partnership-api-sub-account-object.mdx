This doc explains how to use the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/) to manage child accounts. For parent accounts, you'd use the [account](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object/) object.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Before using this API, please note: 

* This API is not available to you unless your organization has been instructed by a New Relic representative to use it.
* You may not have access to using this specific API object. Before using, first read [the requirements](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/).

## Introduction to using child accounts [#overview]

Some notes about using the child account object:

* To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the [Partnership API account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object).
* A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account.
* Every child account must have at least a `primary_admin` user.
* You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user.

## Child account object attributes [#account-attributes]

**Before using the Partnership API, first read [the requirements](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/).**

Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="attr-name"
    title="name (REQUIRED)"
  >
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Type:
          </th>

          <td>
            String
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>
            Default:
          </th>

          <td>
            (none)
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows:

    ```
    conflicting_name_1
    conflicting_name_2
    etc.
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="attr-allow-access"
    title="allow_api_access"
  >
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Type:
          </th>

          <td>
            Boolean
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>
            Default:
          </th>

          <td>
            False
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to `true` for partnerships remotely administering accounts.

    <table>
      <tbody>

          <td>
            Boolean
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>
            Default:
          </th>

          <td>
            False
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time.

    title="users (REQUIRED for some accounts)"

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Type:
          </th>

          <td>
            Array
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account:

    * For [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/) who have migrated their users to [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models): do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use [these user management procedures](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).
    * For all other accounts, which have users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models): When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account `Owner`. To add additional users, use the [Partnership API user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object).

      For more about restrictions, read the [Requirements](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="attr-subscriptions"

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Type:
          </th>

          <td>
            String
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <th>
            Default:
          </th>

          <td>
            (none)
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account `Owner`, the password _must_ match the user's current password.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's [**Account settings** page](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts) in the New Relic UI.

## Child account API calls [#account-calls]

Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the [Partner API key](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partner-api-reference#the-api-key). For example:

```
POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accountsâ€‹
x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{ JSON data }
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Call
      </th>

      <th>
        Resource URL pattern
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Create** a child account with the given parameters.
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## JSON example [#account-status-definitions]

Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object.

**Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the [`users` attribute](#account-attributes) is unnecessary and will be ignored.**

## Child account object API examples [#api-examples-v2]

Here is an example of an API call using the Partnership API child account object.

    Request:

    ```
    curl -X POST \

    -d '{"sub_account":{"name":"Sample child account"}, "users":[{"email":"sample_user@sample.org", "password":"XXXXXX", "first_name":"Sample", "last_name":"User", "role":"admin", "owner":"true"}]}' \
    https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts
