This document is for our [New Relic partners](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions). After you complete your partnership integration, you'll be introduced to your technical contacts at New Relic. Use these channels for non-urgent escalations.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're not a New Relic partner, see New Relic's resources for [finding help or filing a support ticket](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/finding-help).

## New Relic Support [#support]

To obtain support for partner accounts, create a ticket at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/). If you need to call New Relic directly, contact your Business Development representative.

## Documentation [#docs]

Documentation from [New Relic's docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com) is an important resource for your support group when providing Level 1 support to your New Relic subscribers. Posting these links on your support pages is an effective way to encourage self help and reduce your support efforts.

The entry point for New Relic docs: [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com). 

## Online Technical Community [#community]

The New Relic [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/categories) brings together the expertise of New Relic employees, our Partners, and our community regarding all things New Relic.
