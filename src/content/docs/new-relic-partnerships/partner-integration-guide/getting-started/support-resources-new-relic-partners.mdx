This document is for New Relic partners. After you complete your partnership integration, you will be introduced to your technical contacts at New Relic. Use these channels for non-urgent escalations.

## New Relic Support [#support]

To obtain support for partner accounts, create a ticket at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/). If you need to call New Relic directly, contact your Business Development representative.

## Documentation [#docs]

Documentation from [New Relic's docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com) is an important resource for your support group when providing Level 1 support to your New Relic subscribers. Posting these links on your support pages is an effective way to encourage self help and reduce your support efforts.

Top level entry point for New Relic documentation: [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com). From here you can select information about New Relic products and features by category.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The docs site includes a [Partnerships](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships) category with information for New Relic partners and some partnership customers.
