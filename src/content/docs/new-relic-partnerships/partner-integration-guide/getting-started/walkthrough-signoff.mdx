As a final step before going live, an integration walkthrough will be performed (typically via a conference call). The goals of this call and typical topic areas are to:

* Confirm the functionality of the integration.
* Understand and document the customer signup and usage UI workflow for the integration.
* Establish that mutual contractual commitments have been met.
* Evaluate ease of deployment.
* Create a plan for fine-tuning where required.

Where deployment of New Relic requires working accounts or deployed applications, provision should be made in advance of the call for these elements to be in place.
