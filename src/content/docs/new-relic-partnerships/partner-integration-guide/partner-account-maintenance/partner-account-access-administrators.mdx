New Relic offers the option for partner administrators to access their customers' accounts, subject to the contractual terms of the partnership agreement. These settings are controlled by a New Relic admin. For permissions for non-partner accounts, see [Users and roles](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles).

## Guest level access [#guest]

Guest level access allows administrators to view application data on their customers' accounts. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting customer issues related to performance.

## Administrative level access [#admin]

Administrative level access, in addition to viewing application data, allows partner administrators to modify the account and subscription terms, and add or remove users from an account. This access level is required for partners who will remotely administer customer accounts using the API or who enable Restricted access on their accounts.
