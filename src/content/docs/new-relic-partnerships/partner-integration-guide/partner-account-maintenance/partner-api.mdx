Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings.

## Requirements [#requirements]

**There are several major limitations to using the Partnership API.** Your New Relic organization should not use this API unless you've been specifically instructed to use it by your New Relic representative. Please read the entire requirements section to understand limitations. 

The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: [partners](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (managed service providers and New Relic resellers) and [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (larger organizations who've been given access to our partnership account structure).

Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID.

Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers or resellers) have no restrictions on using the Partnership API. New Relic organizations set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) have the following restrictions.

### Customer partnership restrictions [#customer-restrictions]

If your New Relic organization is set up as a [customer partnership](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer [pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) or our newer [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). Details:

* **User model.** If your New Relic organization has users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), you can no longer use Partnership API calls that manage accounts or users. Here are details on what you'd use instead:
  * Instead of using the Partnership API [user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object), you'd [manage users via NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users).
  * Instead of using the Partnership API [account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object) or [child account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-sub-account-object), you'd [manage accounts via NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph).  
* **Pricing model.** If you're on our newer [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), you can't use API calls that govern our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans). The API impacts are:
  * You can't use the [subscription object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object/)
  * You can't use the [NerdGraph Provisioning API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/tutorials/provisions-your-subscriptions-nerdgraph/).

To determine your pricing model or user model, see [Overview of pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).

## Things you can do [#functions]

Here's an overview of what you can do with this API: 

**Account:**

Some organizations that meet the [requirements](#requirements) can use the [account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object/) to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: 

* Create new 
* Show
* Update 
* Cancel
* Show usage
* Set primary admin
* Set subscription 

There is also a [child account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-sub-account-object) for creating child accounts.

**Users:**

Some organizations that [meet the requirements](#customer-restrictions) can use the [user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object) to:

* Add user access to account
* Remove user access from account

**Subscription:**

Organizations that [meet the requirements](#customer-restrictions) and are on our original product pricing model can use the [subscription object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object) to configure various subscription-related traits.
