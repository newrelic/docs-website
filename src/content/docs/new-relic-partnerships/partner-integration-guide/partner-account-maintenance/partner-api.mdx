<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="EOL NOTICE"
>
  The Partnership API reached end of life (EOL) in March 2023 and is no longer supported or available for use.
</Callout>

Our Partnership API allowed New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings.

Since the Partnership API is no longer available, you can use our Nerdgraph API to do many of the same tasks:

* [Manage accounts](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph)
* [Manage users](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users)
* [Manage user groups](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups)
