Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings.

## Requirements [#requirements]

The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: [partners](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (managed service providers, resellers) and [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). 

These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2.

Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID.

Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) have restrictions that follow. 

### Customer partnership restrictions [#customer-restrictions]

If your New Relic organization is set up as a [customer partnership](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer [pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) or our newer [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). Details:

* **Pricing model.** If you’re on the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), you can't use API calls that govern our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans). The API impacts are: 
  * You can't use the [subscription object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object/)
  * You can't use the [NerdGraph Provisioning API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/tutorials/provisions-your-subscriptions-nerdgraph/). 
* **User model.** If your New Relic organization has had its users converted to be on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). The API impacts are:  
  * You can't use the [user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object/). Instead, you'd manage users with [these user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).
  * For the [account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object/): you can't add users via the `users` field. Instead, you'd manage users with [these user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).

To determine your pricing model or user model, see [Overview of pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).

### Password requirements [#password]

Passwords passed for account creation have these requirements: 

* 8 to 50 characters in length
* Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters
* Cannot contain spaces
* Must contain at least 1 letter
* Must contain at least 1 number or special character

## Things you can do [#functions]

Here is an overview of the API's functionality. 

**Account:**

The [account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object/) is what you use to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: 

* Create new
* Show
* Update
* Cancel
* Show usage
* Set primary admin ([some accounts](#requirements))
* Set subscription ([some accounts](#requirements))

There is also a [child account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-sub-account-object) for creating child accounts. 

**Users:**

Some organizations that [meet the requirements](#customer-restrictions) can use the [user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object/) to:

* Add user access to account
* Remove user access from account

**Subscription:** 

Organizations that [meet the requirements](#customer-restrictions) and are on our original product pricing model can use the [subscription object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object/) to configure various subscription-related traits.
