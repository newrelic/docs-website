There are a number of miscellaneous settings that are available to partners for customization of their partnership integration. Most of these settings enable or disable the presentation of New Relic features. These settings must be set by New Relic and are not configurable through the Partnership Console.

## Types of settings [#other-settings]

Contact your [partnership technical contact](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-integration-guide/contacting-new-relic) to have any of these settings modified.
