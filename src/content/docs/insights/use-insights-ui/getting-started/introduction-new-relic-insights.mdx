New Relic Insights is an analytics tool that lets you query and visualize data about your software and infrastructure systems, and better understand that data from a business perspective.

## What is Insights?

Insights is a UI for [querying and charting your New Relic data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). The Insights UI is available for all New Relic users, but the amount of data available and how long it's retained for varies depending on subscriptions.

The Insights UI lets you:

* Make powerful queries using [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), our query language, to troubleshoot and solve problems.
* Use NRQL to generate [custom charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/add-customize-nrql-charts), reports, and [dashboards](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/create-edit-insights-dashboards).
* Combine related dashboards into [data apps](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/data-apps/building-data-apps), which allow teams and non-technical users to easily explore data.

With an Insights Pro subscription, you can [extend the data retention for some event data](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/event-data-retention#insights-pro) (a specific [data type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types)). For example, if you had a New Relic APM Pro subscription, adding an Insights Pro subscription would keep your APM-reported events, including custom events, around longer. Note that a paid Insights subscription gives you longer access to your data, no matter if you use the Insights UI or another [query option](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). For details about benefits of an Insights Pro subscription, see [Event data retention](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/event-data-retention#insights-pro).

  We have an improved way to query and chart your data: [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one). For benefits and notes on switching, see [our transition guide](/docs/transition-new-relic-one-dashboards-insights).

## User and data analysis

New Relic Insights leverages the data from New Relic products and [integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations) to allow you to analyze user behavior, business transactions, customer insights, and more. New Relic APM helps people optimize their apps, while Insights helps people optimize their bottom line. It's a software analytics resource to help everyone from C-level executives to front-end developers make better decisions and build better products.

Using the Insights UI, you can quickly and easily build dashboards to identify problems with your apps and hosts in real-time or to track ongoing data trends.

Insights gives you access to:

* A high-powered, index-free database that stores your New Relic-reported data in the cloud.
* [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql): a query language similar to SQL, allowing powerful and specific analysis of your data.
* The [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api): a REST-ful API for reporting custom [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) and attributes and to [get data for local applications](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/querying-data-remotely/querying-your-data-remotely).
* A dashboard management interface with a [collection of charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types) to help you represent data quickly and clearly, and an [API to manage those dashboards](/docs/insights/insights-api/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-api).

You can also view Insights in New Relic's [Android and iOS Insights mobile app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-apps/insights-app/insights-app-android-ios) and on [Apple TV](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-apps/insights-app/insights-app-apple-tv).

## Data reporting and security

Insights accesses [data reported from New Relic products and services](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/insights-default-data-other-new-relic-products). It doesnâ€™t report data on its own.

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/why-new-relic/security).

## What data can you query in Insights?

To understand the type of data you can query in Insights, see [Introduction to NRQL.](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query) To get started querying, see [Start learning NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#start-learning).

You can add [custom attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes) to some [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) in order to better understand your customers, your app, and your business. You can also create [custom events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events) for page views, host transactions, or anything that can be reported online.

Use the [event data explorer](/docs/insights/explore-data/data-explorer/event-explorer-query-chart-your-event-data) to search for and understand your event data.

## Metric timeslice data

New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile report and display some metrics in a simple format that we call [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data). To query this type of data, you can:

* Use [Insights' metric data explorer](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/explore/metric-data-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents) to search and chart this data (including [custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-metrics/custom-metrics)).
* [Query it with NRQL.](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql)

## Send custom data to Insights

See [Report custom data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights).

## Compatibility and requirements

Most data New Relic reports is accessible for querying in Insights and with NRQL. Here are some compatibility details for our main products:
