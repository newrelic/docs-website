## Use NRQL query history

To view up to twenty of your most recent queries, select the **History** tab directly below the query command line interface. Use the query history to adjust and improve recent queries.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Run recent queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a recent query from the history list. The query will appear on the command line, where it can be edited.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Delete queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list so the delete <Icon name="trash-2"/>
        icon appears. The query history only retains the twenty most recent queries, so it can be useful to delete unwanted queries to make room for queries you like.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Favorite queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list and the favorite <Icon name="star"/>
        icon appears. Then, to view and use your favorite queries, select the **Favorites** tab.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
