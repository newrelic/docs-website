[New Relic Insights](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights)' **Query** page is one place you can run [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) of your data.

To get started: Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Query**, then use any of the available [NRQL syntax and functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions).

Use the **Query** page to:

* [Create and run queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql#command-line-query) of your data.
* View your [query history](#history).
* View [favorite queries](#history).
* Use the NRQL query to create, view, organize, and share Insights dashboards.

## Use NRQL query history

To view up to twenty of your most recent queries, select the **History** tab directly below the query command line interface. Use the query history to adjust and improve recent queries.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Run recent queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a recent query from the history list. The query will appear on the command line, where it can be edited.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Delete queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list so the delete <i className="fa fa-trash-o">
        \[trash]
        </i>
        icon appears. The query history only retains the twenty most recent queries, so it can be useful to delete unwanted queries to make room for queries you like.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Favorite queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list and the favorite <i className="fa fa-star-o">
        star
        </i>
        icon appears. Then, to view and use your favorite queries, select the **Favorites** tab.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
