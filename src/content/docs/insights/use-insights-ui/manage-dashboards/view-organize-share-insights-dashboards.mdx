New Relic Insights provides several different options to view your dashboards, organize and quickly find your dashboards, and share your dashboards with colleagues.

## View an existing dashboard [#view]

To find and view an existing dashboard:

1. Go to [**insights.newrelic.com**](https://insights.newrelic.com), and select the **All dashboards** icon.
2. From **All Dashboards**, select the dashboard from the list.

You can also:

* Enter **fullscreen mode** by selecting the fullscreen <Icon name="fe-maximize-2"/>
  icon in the upper right corner.
* Enable **Dark mode** for your Insights dashboard by selecting the the fullscreen <Icon name="fe-maximize-2"/>
  icon, and then selecting the lightbulb <Icon name="fe-lightbulb"/>
  icon next to it.

Dashboard [chart refresh intervals](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-refresh-intervals) vary depending on the timeframe.

## Organize dashboards

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="favorite"
    title="Favorite dashboards"
  >
    To favorite a dashboard, select the star icon. Favorite dashboards appear at the top of the dashboards list. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linked-dashboards"
    title="Linked dashboards"
  >
    You can use the [FACET widget](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-facet) to link to a [pre-filtered dashboard](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/filtering-dashboards). Creating links allows your users to navigate between dashboards in an intuitive way. If you link to a private dashboard, only those with access will be able to view the target dashboard. To create a link:

    1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Dashboards > (select a dashboard)**.
    2. From the chart you want to link, select **Link** from the chart menu <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
       .
    3. Select the target dashboard from the list.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Share dashboards

A dashboard will only be accessible by users [with sufficient permissions to view it](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-permissions).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="peramlinks"
    title="Permalink a dashboard"
  >
    Permalinks are URLs that show the state of the dashboard at the moment the button was pressed. The URL includes a query string to allow others to reproduce this snapshot.

    To share a permalink snapshot of a dashboard:

    1. From the selected dashboard, select **Permalink**.
    2. Copy the URL from the browser address bar.
    3. To restore the dashboard, select **Return to Current**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="share-url"
    title="Share dashboard via URL"
  >
    To share a dashboard via the URL:

    1. Copy the URL from the browser address bar.
    2. Delete any information after the the dashboard number to make sure you are sharing a clean URL when sharing dashboards.

    This is a clean URL:

    ```
    https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/0123/dashboards/267
    ```

    This may contain information you do not want to share:

    ```
    https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/0123/dashboards/267?query=SELECT%20count(*)%20FROM%20PageView%20FACET%20userAgentOS%0A
    ```

    You can also [embed individual widgets for public sharing](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/using-widgets#embed).
