<Callout variant="important">
  As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

Data apps are collections of linked dashboards that create a curated, application-like experience. Even users who do not know NRQL can explore your business data with data apps. For example, with data apps and [custom attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes), your support department could easily check how often an individual account or user accesses a particular feature of your app.

## Create a data app [#creating]

<Callout variant="important">
  We have an improved way to build dashboards with multiple pages in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one). Learn how to make the [transition from Insights to New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights).
</Callout>

To create a new data app:

1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Data apps > Create a data app**.
2. Specify an **[Icon](#setting-icon)**, **[Title](#setting-title)**, **[URL](#setting-url)**, **[Description](#setting-description)**, and **[Permissions](#setting-permissions)** for your app.
3. Select **Create** to save your new data app.

After creating your app, customize it with new or existing dashboards from your account.

## Add dashboards to your data app [#adding-dashboards]

After creating your data app, Insights automatically redirects to a new dashboard. You can [add widgets to this dashboard using standard NRQL queries](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/using-widgets).

You can also create additional dashboards by selecting **+ Add** from the data app navigation bar, or copy an existing dashboard into your data app:

1. From your data app dashboard, select **Edit**, then select **Configure data app**.
2. Select the **Copy** dropdown, and choose a dashboard.

Copied dashboards are independent of the original dashboard. Changes to the original dashboard do not affect the copy, and editing or deleting the copied dashboard does not affect the original.

## Link between dashboards with FACETs [#linking]

This feature has been improved in New Relic One dashboards. For details, see [Filter by facets](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets).

You can use the [FACET widget](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-facet) to link to a [pre-filtered dashboard](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/filtering-dashboards). Creating links allows your users to navigate between dashboards in an intuitive way.

For example, you could link a faceted list of most-active users to another dashboard. Clicking a username in the first dashboard opens the linked dashboard and filters it to show only metrics from that user account.

To create a link:

1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) >** **Data apps > (select a data app)**.
2. Select the dashboard containing the widget you want to link from, then select **Edit**.
3. From the widget you want to link, select the link ![insights widget link icon.png](./images/icon-link-widget.png "insights widget link icon.png") icon.
4. Select the target dashboard from the list.

## Manage dashboards in data apps [#managing]

After creating a dashboard, you can manage the order in which your dashboards appear in the data app's navigation bar. You can also hide certain dashboards if you only want to [link to that dashboard](#linking), but not have it clutter the navigation bar. To manage dashboards, edit the settings for your app:

1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Data apps > (select a data app)**.
2. Select **Edit > Configure data app**.
3. Mouse over an individual dashboard to view the management tools and make your changes.
4. When finished, select the **X** icon or click anywhere outside the dialog box to save your changes automatically.

The following dashboard management options are available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Option
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="manage-move">
      <td>
        Reorder dashboards
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over the dashboard in the list and select the up or down arrow icons to reorder the navigation bar.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="manage-primary">
      <td>
        Set primary dashboard
      </td>

      <td>
        The first dashboard in the list is the primary dashboard. Whenever a user selects your data app, this is be the first dashboard they see. To change the primary dashboard, [use the reorder arrows](#manage-move) to move it to the top of the dashboard list.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="manage-hide">
      <td>
        Hide or unhide a dashboard
      </td>

      <td>
        Select the eye icon to hide a dashboard from the data app's navigation bar. You can still [link to this dashboard with FACET widgets](#linking), but the dashboard is otherwise invisible to data app users. This allows you to have many dashboards in your app without cluttering the navigation bar. Select the eye icon again to unhide the dashboard.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="manage-delete">
      <td>
        Delete a dashboard
      </td>

      <td>
        Select the delete icon to remove a dashboard from your data app. This permanently removes the dashboard and all its widgets. If the dashboard was copied from another dashboard, the original dashboard will not be deleted.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Change data app settings [#configure]

To edit the settings for an existing data app:

1. Go to [insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) **> Data apps > (select a data app) > Edit**.
2. Select **Configure data app**, then make your changes.
3. When finished, select the **X** icon or click anywhere outside the dialog box to save your changes automatically.

The following settings are available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Option
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="setting-icon">
      <td>
        Icon
      </td>

      <td>
        Select an icon to quickly identify a particular data app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-title">
      <td>
        Title
      </td>

      <td>
        Specify a name for your app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-url">
      <td>
        URL
      </td>

      <td>
        Specify a custom URL for your app.

        This setting is not available when configuring an existing app, only when creating a new data app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-description">
      <td>
        Description
      </td>

      <td>
        Specify a description for your app, which allows you to summarize the app for other account users.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-permissions">
      <td>
        Permissions
      </td>

      <td>
        There are three levels of sharing permissions for data apps:

        * **Private just to me**: Most secure option
        * **Viewable by others in my account**
        * **Editable by others in my account**: Default option
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-query-bar">
      <td>
        Show query bar
      </td>

      <td>
        Hide or show the query bar when using the data app. Hiding the query bar gives your users a more curated, application-like experience.

        This setting is not available when creating a new data app, only when configuring an existing app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="setting-delete-app">
      <td>
        Delete the app
      </td>

      <td>
        To permanently delete the data app and all of its dashboards, select the trash can icon.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
