<Callout variant="important">
  As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

In New Relic Insights, metric charts display [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data). Because metric charts are a different data type than [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data), they have a different display and [customization options](#options).

Metric timeslice data can be [queried using NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql). This gives you more control over how you query and chart this data type.

## Add metric charts to dashboard [#add-metric-widgets]

Add metric charts to Insights dashboards to:

* Chart, organize, and monitor metric data in a centralized place
* Track metrics that the New Relic UI does not chart by default

Add metric charts to an Insights dashboard via the [Metric Explorer](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/explore/metric-data-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents) in New Relic Insights or via the standard [**Add to dashboard option**](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions#add-to-dashboard) on any supported New Relic UI metric chart. You can only chart one metric namespace per chart.

## Customize metric charts [#customize]

To customize a metric chart from an Insights dashboard:

1. From the dashboard where the chart is, select the chart's menu <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
   icon.
2. Customize the chart [options](#options).
3. Select **Save changes**.

Use any of the available options to customize metric charts:

<table id="options">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        View metric values broken out by host
      </td>

      <td>
        Select **Facet by host**. This option is available both in the Insights Metric Explorer for the chart at creation time as well as via the metric chart editing UI.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Change the time window
      </td>

      <td>
        * Starting time: To change when the chart's time window starts, select the time dropdown.
        * Ending time: All agent metric charts' ending time defaults to now.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Change the title
      </td>

      <td>
        Titles are automatically generated showing the metric name in many cases. Once an agent metric chart is added to a dashboard, you can edit its title, maximum 255 characters.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Broaden the scope of metrics
      </td>

      <td>
        To broaden the scope of metrics that are charted, select the metric namespace, and wildcard `%` any segment of it.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="value-function">
        Change the Y-axis value
      </td>

      <td>
        To change the charted Y-axis value to another [value function](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#value-function), select the dropdown. Available value functions depend on the kind of metric data the chart is displaying.

        Common examples include:

        * Call count
        * Calls per minute
        * Average requests per minute
        * Maximum
        * Minimum
        * Throughput

        Some charts added via the **Add to Insights dashboard** chart option may not support changing the value function. To change the value function for the metric, use the Metric Explorer to find and chart it.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Expand the chart
      </td>

      <td>
        Enlarge the selected chart to get a better view of the data.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Filter on agent metric charts [#filter-metric-widgets]

If your dashboard has [filtering enabled](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/filtering-dashboards), you can still filter on NRQL charts. However, filtering does not apply to any agent metric charts on the dashboard.
