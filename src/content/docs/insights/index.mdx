    <Callout variant="important">
      As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
    </Callout>

    Insights is one of [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one)'s resources for software analytics. You can use it to:

    * Gather data across your entire ecosystem, including frontend and backend services, infrastructure, and digital customer experiences.
    * Understand what your data says about your business.

    For an even better experience with querying and charting, [make the transition to New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights).
