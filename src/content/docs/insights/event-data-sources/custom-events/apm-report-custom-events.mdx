If you have [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), you can report custom [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data), which is then available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) in New Relic.

Related documentation:

* [Add custom attributes to existing events](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes)
* [Send custom events using the Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api) (without need for APM)

<Callout variant="caution">
  Custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with [high security mode](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/high-security).
</Callout>

## Data considerations [#considerations]

The New Relic agents sends [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) to New Relic as part of its normal harvest cycle every 5 seconds for agent versions supporting [real time streaming](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming).

Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit.

<Callout variant="tip">

## Record a custom event [#steps]

To record a custom event, follow the procedure for your New Relic language agent:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="c-sdk"
    title="C SDK"
  >
    To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the `newrelic_create_custom_event` and `newrelic_record_custom_event` functions. For more information, see the [Guide to using the C SDK API](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/guide-using-c-sdk-api#custom-events).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="go"
    title="Go"
  >
    To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use [`RecordCustomEvent`](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/create-custom-events-insights-go).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="java-att"
    title="Java"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call [`recordCustomEvent`](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/index.html?com/newrelic/api/agent/Insights.html). For example:

    ```
    Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent("<var>MyCustomEvent</var>", <var>eventAttributes</var>);
    ```

    The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords).

    You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in `newrelic.yml`.

    Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events:

    ```
    custom_insights_events:
      max_samples_stored: 5000
    ```

    To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your `newrelic.yml`:

    ```
    custom_insights_events:
      enabled: false
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration:

      ```
      custom_insights_events.enabled: true
      custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000
      ```
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="net-att"
    title=".NET"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call [`RecordCustomEvent()`](/docs/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/recordcustomevent-net-agent). For example:

    ```
    var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>();
    NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes);
    ```

    The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords).

    You can turn off custom events entirely by setting [`customEvents.enabled`](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#customevents-enabled) to `false` in `newrelic.config`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="node-att"
    title="Node.js"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example:

    ```
    recordCustomEvent(<var>eventType</var>, <var>attributes</var>)
    ```

    Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords).

    To disable custom events entirely, add `custom_insights_events.enabled: false` to `newrelic.js`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="php-att"
    title="PHP"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example:

    ```
    newrelic_record_custom_event("<var>WidgetSale</var>", array("<var>color</var>"=>"<var>red</var>", "<var>weight</var>"=><var>12.5</var>));
    ```

    The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords).

    By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed.

    To disable custom events entirely, add `newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false` to your `newrelic.ini` and restart the agent.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="python-att"
    title="Python"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example:

    ```
    newrelic.agent.<mark>record_custom_event</mark>(event_type, params, application=None)
    ```

    The `event_type` defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the `params` keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on `event_type` and `params`, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords)

    If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the `application` keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the `newrelic.agent.application()` function.

    To disable custom events entirely, set [`custom_insights_events.enabled`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#custom_insights_events_enabled) to `False` in your `newrelic.ini` configuration file.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="ruby-att"
    title="Ruby"
  >
    Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example:

    ```
    ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('<var>WidgetSale</var>', <var>color</var>: '<var>red</var>', <var>weight</var>: <var>12.5</var>)
    ```

    The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see [Limits and restricted characters](#limits) and [Reserved words](#keywords).

    You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in `newrelic.yml`:

    1. Add [`custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored:`](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored) to your configuration file.
    2. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add:

       ```
       custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000
       ```

    To disable custom events entirely, add `custom_insights_events.enabled: false` to `newrelic.yml`.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Timestamps

You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API.

## Limits and restricted characters [#limits]

See [Custom event data requirements](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/data-requirements) for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements.

## Reserved words [#keywords]

Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of [reserved terms used by NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-reserved-words). Otherwise unexpected results may occur.
