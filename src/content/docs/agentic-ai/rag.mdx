The RAG APIs available in New Relic allow you to enhance your AI experiences. Allow AI to gain further insight into your systems and surface important infomration quickly. Use our managed integrations or write your own to take advantage of the platform.

## Key features [#features]

- **Automatic Integration with NRAI:** Once you create your RAG tools using the APIs, you can immediately begin indexing content. That content will seamlessly integrate with your NRAI experiences.
- **Managed Solutions:** Take the pain out of writing your own integrations and leverage our in-house managed solutions for common 3rd parties. (more coming soon!)
- **Enhanced Agents:** In the future, build your own agents and customize which RAG tools are available to each agent.
