Your use of New Relic AI features is billable starting June 4, 2025, in accordance with your Order. The costs associated with this feature are determined by the following factors, as applicable to the pricing model associated with your account:

## Core Compute (measured in Core CCU)
Costs are incurred for fetching your telemetry data by executing queries (NRQL, NerdGraph). Consumption only occurs if the query execution is successful. Query execution (data fetch) consumes Core CCU.

## Advanced Compute (measured in Advanced CCU)
Costs are incurred for AI reasoning and query generation. Consumption always occurs when the AI model processes your prompt. AI answering, reasoning, or summarizing consumes Advanced CCU. Preview usage was free. General availability (GA) consumption of Advanced CCUs will follow New Relic's published rates (currently around $0.60 per aCCU).

Examples of monetized New Relic AI features consuming advanced CCUs:

- **Natural language to NRQL (NL2NRQL):** Ask questions in plain English. Get NRQL queries and results.
- **Explain this error:** Click to get New Relic AI explanations for logs and errors inbox stack traces.
- **Response intelligence:** Features like **incident impact analysis** and **what happened last time?** found on the issue page use New Relic AI to assist in incident response.
- **Agentic integrations:** Connect New Relic to platforms like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and ServiceNow, for cross-tool workflows.

## How to track and manage your New Relic AI usage
New Relic provides full CCU consumption transparency through the Usage UI.

  title="Does an error mean I won’t be charged?"
>
  For data fetching errors (like a failed query), no charge. For AI reasoning (LLM processing), usage is billed once processing occurs, even if the answer isn't perfect. For example, if you use the NL2NRQL feature and a valid NRQL query is generated but fails to execute, you will consume aCCUs but not cCCUs.
