<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).


    This feature uses New Relic Generative AI, subject to [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy) and [service specific terms](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/service-specific).
</Callout>


The New Relic AI custom plugin for Amazon Q Business integrates New Relic's AI-driven insights directly into the Amazon Q Business environment. This plugin allows you to send user prompts to New Relic AI and receive AI-generated responses, facilitating improved incident response and decision-making processes.

This guide provides instructions to establish a connection between New Relic AI and Amazon Q Business, enabling anomaly detection, real-time alerting, and incident management to maintain application performance and reliability.


## Prerequisites [#prereq]

* A valid New Relic account with the Client ID and Client Secret. If you don't have these, contact [agenticai@newrelic.com](mailto:agenticai@newrelic.com).
* An operational Amazon Q Business application. For more information to create an Amazon Q Business application environment, refer [Amazon Q Business documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-app.html).
* AWS CLI is installed and configured on your system. For more information, refer [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
* Permissions to create IAM policies and roles in AWS.
* Permissions to create a plugins in the Amazon Q Business service.
* An IAM policy and role that grant the New Relic AI plugin permissions to access AWS resources. For more information, refer [Create IAM Policy and Role](#create-iam-policy-role).


### Create IAM Policy and Role [#create-iam-policy-role]

Create an IAM policy and role that grant the New Relic AI plugin permissions to access AWS resources. The policy defines permissions for accessing services such as AWS Secrets Manager, while the role allows Amazon Q Business Business to assume these permissions securely. This setup ensures role-based access control and minimizes direct credential management.

<Callout variant="important">
  * Before you create an  IAM role, contact to New Relic to get the Client ID and Client Secret.

</Callout>

1. To create an IAM policy, update and run the following command:

    ```bash
    aws iam create-policy \
    --policy-name <policy-name> \
    --policy-document '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:<secret-name>" }] }'
    ```

    * Replace `<policy-name>` with your policy name.
    * Replace `<region>` with your AWS region.
    * Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
    * Replace `<secret-name>` with the New Relic provided secret.


2. To create an IAM role, run the following command:

    ```bash
        aws iam create-role \
        --role-name <role-name> \
        --assume-role-policy-document '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": "sts:AssumeRole" }] }'
    ```
    * Replace `<role-name>` with a name to identify the role..

3. To attach the policy to the role, update and run the following command:

    ```bash
    aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name <role-name> \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/<policy-name>
    ```

    * Replace `<policy-name>` with the policy name created in step 1.
    * Replace `<role-name>` with the role name created in step 2.
    * Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.


## Create NRAI Plugin [#create-plugin]

You can create the NRAI plugin manually or by using the AWS CLI.

## Communicate with New Relic Agent in Amazon Q Business [#communicate-nrai] 

After creating the NRAI plugin, you can communicate with the New Relic Agent in Amazon Q Business to send user prompts and receive AI-generated responses.

To access the New Relic agent:

1. Sign in to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.
2. Navigate to **Applications** and select your application.
3. Access the deployed URL to access the chat assistant.
4. On the Chat window, click **Plugins** and select the **New Relic AI** plugin.
5. Enter your prompt in the chat window and click the **Send** icon. You will be prompted to authorize Amazon Q Business to access New Relic account. This is a one-time authorization process.
6. Click **Authorize**.

    The New Relic AI agent processes your prompt and returns the response in real-time.
