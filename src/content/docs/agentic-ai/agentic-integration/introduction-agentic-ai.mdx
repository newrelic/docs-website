New Relic's Agentic Integration provides an AI-driven solution to automate and optimize observability workflows, enhancing system management and monitoring. This integration facilitates seamless operations by automating repetitive tasks through AI agents, reducing manual intervention. By integrating seamlessly with platforms such as, GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q Business, Gemini Code Assist, and ServiceNow, Agentic Integrations transform complex workflows into seamless operations.


## Key features [#features]

- **Intelligent automation:** Leverage AI to automate and streamline complex workflows, reducing the need for manual tool-switching and enhancing productivity.
- **Enhanced observability:** Gain comprehensive insights into your systems, enabling faster detection, analysis, and resolution of incidents.
- **Seamless integration:** Connect with popular platforms such as GitHub Copilot to bring powerful analytics and insights directly into your existing workflows.

## Access and data management [#access-data-mgmt]

When enrolling in the Agentic Integrations, be aware that your New Relic users can enable any agentic integrations made available by New Relic at that time. If you desire to limit the users who have access to the agentic integrations, you may use [custom roles and groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) to refine access.  

Additionally, our integration partners will manage client applications and maintain user tokens when you or any of your users authenticate to New Relic through the partner's integration. The third party partner will have the same level of access to New Relic as the user who authenticated for the amount of time configured in the user settings, as the tokens are used on their behalf. This arrangement helps to provide seamless integration and functionality. For more information, you can refer to the partner's documentation which details their token usage and management practices.

## Current integrations [#integrations]

### GitHub Copilot [#github-copilot]
Integrate New Relic insights directly into your IDE with GitHub Copilot. You can use Agent AI to access logs, errors, and recommendations without leaving your coding environment. It  provides real-time insights as they develop and deploy the code.

This integration offers:

- Automated deployment checks: Conduct deployment checks automatically, leveraging New Relic's data.
- Real-time alerts and error tracking: Stay informed with immediate alerts and track errors as they occur.
- Probabilistic recommendations for deployment actions.

For more information, refer [Getting Started with New Relic agent for GitHub Copilot](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/github-copilot-integration).

### Gemini Code Assist [#gemini-code-assist]
Integrate New Relic insights into your IDE with Gemini Code Assist. This tool allows developers to access relevant logs, error information, and recommendations within the coding environment, offering insights that can inform the development and deployment process.

This integration offers:

- Automated Deployment Monitoring: Automatically monitor deployments using New Relic's real-time data to identify and address issues efficiently.
- Alerts and Error Tracking: Receive immediate notifications and track errors effectively to uphold application performance and stability.
- Recommendations for Deployment Actions: Utilize recommendations based on data analysis to improve code performance and support decision-making.

For more information, refer [Getting Started with New Relic agent for Gemini Code Assist](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/gemini-integration).

### ServiceNow Now Assist [#now-assist]
New Relic AI insights are now right inside ServiceNow's Now Assist. This integration helps your operations teams—like first responders and support agents—quickly understand incident severity, identify probable root causes, and streamline collaboration, all without leaving their ServiceNow workspace.

For more information, refer to [Getting Started with New Relic agent for ServiceNow Now Assist](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/servicenow-integration).
## Tools [#tools]

Each agentic integration comes with various tools to use New Relic platform capabilities and provide observability insights, alerts, and predictions. 

To learn more, refer to [New Relic AI tools](/docs/agentic-ai/tools).
