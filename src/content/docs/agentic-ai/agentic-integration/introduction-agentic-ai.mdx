New Relic offers AI integration solutions that help automate and optimize observability workflows. These integrations facilitate operations by automating repetitive tasks through AI agents, reducing manual intervention and enabling faster incident response. New Relic provides two main approaches: the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for broad AI tool compatibility, and direct ServiceNow integration for operations teams.

## AI integration approaches [#integration-approaches]

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) [#mcp]
This is New Relic infrastructure that allows any compatible AI tool to connect to New Relic:
- **Standardized protocol**: Works with multiple AI development environments
- **Comprehensive toolset**: Specialized tools for accessing observability data
- **Future-proof**: Built on industry standards with broad AI tool support

For most users, **MCP is the recommended approach** as it provides broader compatibility and more comprehensive capabilities. Learn more about [New Relic MCP](/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview).

### ServiceNow integration [#servicenow]
New Relic AI insights are now right inside ServiceNow's Now Assist. This integration helps your operations teams, such as first responders and support agents, quickly understand incident severity, identify probable root causes, and streamline collaboration, all without leaving their ServiceNow workspace.

For more information, refer to [Getting Started with New Relic agent for ServiceNow Now Assist](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/servicenow-integration).


## Key features [#features]

- **Intelligent automation:** Leverage AI to automate and streamline complex workflows, reducing the need for manual tool-switching and enhancing productivity, while keeping a human in the loop.
- **Enhanced observability:** Gain comprehensive insights into your systems, enabling faster detection, analysis, and resolution of incidents.
- **Seamless integration:** Connect with ServiceNow Now Assist to bring powerful analytics and insights directly into your existing workflows.

## Access and data management [#access-data-mgmt]

Our integration partners will manage client applications and maintain user tokens when you or any of your users authenticate to New Relic through the partner's integration. The third party partner will have the same level of access to New Relic as the user who authenticated for the amount of time configured in the user settings, as the tokens are used on their behalf. This arrangement helps to provide seamless integration and functionality. For more information, you can refer to the partner's documentation which details their token usage and management practices.

### Role based access control (RBAC)
New Relic's AI integration capabilities are granted via organization-scoped roles within New Relic's RBAC system. Users gain access by belonging to a group with an assigned organizational role that includes these capabilities. Individual accounts do not require direct configuration.

Currently, RBAC can be accessed through API interfaces. If you are interested in utilizing RBAC via API, feel free to contact us at agenticai@newrelic.com. For detailed guidance on setting up RBAC, refer to our [account user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial).

## Tools [#tools]

Each integration comes with various tools to use New Relic platform capabilities and provide observability insights, alerts, and predictions. 

To learn more, refer to [New Relic AI tools](/docs/agentic-ai/tools).

## Pricing and usage
AI integration is available to New Relic accounts with Advanced Compute pricing. For detailed pricing information, contact our sales team or refer to your Order.
