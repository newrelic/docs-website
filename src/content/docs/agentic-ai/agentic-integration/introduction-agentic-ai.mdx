New Relic's agentic integration provides an AI-driven solution to help automate and optimize specific observability workflows, enhancing system management and monitoring. This integration facilitates seamless operations by automating repetitive tasks through AI agents, reducing manual intervention. By integrating seamlessly with platforms such as GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist, and ServiceNow, agentic integrations transform complex workflows into seamless operations.

## AI integration approaches [#integration-approaches]

New Relic offers two complementary approaches for AI integration:

### Agentic integrations [#agentic-integrations]
These are New Relic tools and agents that work within third-party AI platforms:
- **GitHub Copilot integration**: New Relic agent that works inside GitHub Copilot
- **Gemini Code Assist integration**: New Relic tool that works inside Google's Gemini Code Assist
- **ServiceNow integration**: New Relic insights embedded in ServiceNow Now Assist

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) [#mcp]
This is New Relic infrastructure that allows any compatible AI tool to connect to New Relic:
- **Standardized protocol**: Works with multiple AI development environments
- **Comprehensive toolset**: 35+ tools for accessing observability data
- **Future-proof**: Built on industry standards with broad AI tool support

For most users, **MCP is the recommended approach** as it provides broader compatibility and more comprehensive capabilities. Learn more about [New Relic MCP](/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview).


## Key features [#features]

- **Intelligent automation:** Leverage AI to automate and streamline complex workflows, reducing the need for manual tool-switching and enhancing productivity, while keeping a human in the loop.
- **Enhanced observability:** Gain comprehensive insights into your systems, enabling faster detection, analysis, and resolution of incidents.
- **Seamless integration:** Connect with popular platforms such as GitHub Copilot to bring powerful analytics and insights directly into your existing workflows.

## Access and data management [#access-data-mgmt]

Our integration partners will manage client applications and maintain user tokens when you or any of your users authenticate to New Relic through the partner's integration. The third party partner will have the same level of access to New Relic as the user who authenticated for the amount of time configured in the user settings, as the tokens are used on their behalf. This arrangement helps to provide seamless integration and functionality. For more information, you can refer to the partner's documentation which details their token usage and management practices.

### Role based access control (RBAC)
New Relic's agentic integration capabilities are granted via organization-scoped roles within New Relic's RBAC system. Users gain access by belonging to a group with an assigned organizational role that includes these capabilities. Individual accounts do not require direct configuration.

Currently, RBAC can be accessed through API interfaces. If you are interested in utilizing RBAC via API, feel free to contact us at agenticai@newrelic.com. For detailed guidance on setting up RBAC, refer to our [account user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial).

## Current integrations [#integrations]

### GitHub Copilot [#github-copilot]

<Callout title="Deprecation Notice" variant="caution">
  PLACEHOLDER: This integration will be deprecated on **[DATE TBD]** due to [PLATFORM-SPECIFIC REASON]. We recommend migrating to [New Relic MCP](/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview) for enhanced capabilities and broader AI tool support.
</Callout>

Integrate New Relic insights directly into your IDE with GitHub Copilot. You can use Agent AI to access logs, errors, and recommendations without leaving your coding environment. It  provides real-time insights as you develop and deploy the code.

This integration offers:

- Automated deployment checks: Conduct deployment checks automatically, leveraging New Relic's data.
- Real-time alerts and error tracking: Stay informed with immediate alerts and track errors as they occur.
- Probabilistic recommendations for deployment actions.

For more information, refer to [Getting Started with New Relic agent for GitHub Copilot](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/github-copilot-integration).

### ServiceNow Now Assist [#now-assist]

New Relic AI insights are now right inside ServiceNow's Now Assist. This integration helps your operations teams, such as first responders and support agents, quickly understand incident severity, identify probable root causes, and streamline collaboration, all without leaving their ServiceNow workspace.

For more information, refer to [Getting Started with New Relic agent for ServiceNow Now Assist](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/servicenow-integration).

### Gemini Code Assist [#gemini-code-assist]

<Callout title="Deprecation Notice" variant="caution">
  PLACEHOLDER: This integration will be deprecated on **[DATE TBD]** due to [PLATFORM-SPECIFIC REASON]. We recommend migrating to [New Relic MCP](/docs/agentic-ai/mcp/overview) for enhanced capabilities and broader AI tool support.
</Callout>

Integrate New Relic insights into your IDE with Gemini Code Assist. This tool allows developers to access relevant logs, error information, and recommendations within the coding environment, offering insights that can inform the development and deployment process.

This integration offers:

- Automated Deployment Monitoring: Automatically monitor deployments using New Relic's real-time data to identify and address issues efficiently.
- Alerts and Error Tracking: Receive immediate notifications and track errors effectively to uphold application performance and stability.
- Recommendations for Deployment Actions: Utilize recommendations based on data analysis to improve code performance and support decision-making.

For more information, refer [Getting Started with New Relic agent for Gemini Code Assist](/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-integration/gemini-integration).

## Tools [#tools]

Each agentic integration comes with various tools to use New Relic platform capabilities and provide observability insights, alerts, and predictions. 

To learn more, refer to [New Relic AI tools](/docs/agentic-ai/tools).

## Pricing and usage
Agentic integration is available to New Relic accounts with Advanced Compute pricing. For detailed pricing information, contact our sales team or refer to your Order.
