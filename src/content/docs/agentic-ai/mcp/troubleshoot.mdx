## OAuth flow not starting
- Ensure your browser can access `localhost`.
- Check firewall settings.
- Verify that your tools can access `OAuth` URLs.

## API key not working
- Verify key format (starts with `NRAK-`).
- Check key permissions in New Relic.
- Ensure the key is not expired.

## MCP server not detected
- Restart the application completely.
- Check `JSON` syntax validity.
- Verify file paths and permissions.
## mcp-remote proxy issues
- Ensure `Node.js` is installed.
- Check internet connectivity.
- Verify npx can access `mcp-remote` package.

## Error messages
- **Connection refused**: Check URL and network connectivity of your tools.
- **Authentication required**: Verify that the API key is still active and was inputted correctly or complete `OAuth` flow.
- **Invalid client**: `OAuth` configuration issue, try `mcp-remote` proxy.
- **`Time.UnmarshalJSON`**: Use `mcp-remote` proxy for `OAuth`.
