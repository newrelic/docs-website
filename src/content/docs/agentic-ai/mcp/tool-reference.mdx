New Relic's MCP server provides specialized tools that enable AI agents to access and analyze your observability data. This reference guide organizes all available tools by category.

## How to use MCP tools [#how-to-use]

MCP tools are invoked through natural language queries in your AI development environment. You don't need to memorize exact tool names or parameters. Just describe what you want to know about your New Relic data.

**Example queries:**
- "What entities are in my account?"
- "Show me recent alerts for my web application"
- "What are the top errors from the last hour?"
- "Run an NRQL query to analyze performance"

Your AI tool will automatically select the appropriate MCP tools and format the results for you.

## Filter tools with `include-tags` [#filter-tools]

Some tools appear in multiple categories (for example, `analyze_deployment_impact` is relevant to both `incident-response` and `advanced-analysis`) because they are tagged with multiple relevant tags.

You can dynamically filter the tools your AI agent receives by sending the `include-tags` `HTTP` header with your requests. This allows you to request only specific subsets of tools, which is helpful for reducing the tool corpus and improving the AI model's efficiency and accuracy.

The available tags you can use for filtering correspond directly to the category headers in this reference: `discovery`, `data-access`, `alerting`, `incident-response`, `performance-analytics`, as well as `advanced-analysis`.

### Example implementation [#example]

```json
"servers": {
    "new-relic-mcp-server": {
        "url": "https://mcp.newrelic.com/mcp/",
        "type": "http",
        "headers": {
            "api-key": "NRAK-****",
            "include-tags": "discovery,alerting"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the AI agent will only be presented with tools categorized under discovery (for example, `get_entity`) and alerting (for example, `get_alert_policies`), ensuring that the model focuses only on the most relevant functions for its current task.


## Entity and account management (tag: discovery) [#entity-account]

- `convert_time_period_to_epoch_ms`: Convert a time period (for example, "last 30 minutes") to epoch milliseconds.
- `get_dashboard`: Fetch details about a specific dashboard.
- `get_entity`: Fetch New Relic entities by GUID or search by name pattern.
- `get_related_entities`: Fetch entities 1 hop away (related) from a given entity `GUID`.
- `list_available_new_relic_accounts`: List all account `IDs` available to the user.
- `list_dashboards`: List all dashboards for a New Relic account.
- `list_entity_types`: List the complete catalog of New Relic entity types with domain/type definitions.
- `search_entity_with_tag`: Search for entities using a specific tag key and value.

## Data Access (tag: data-access) [#data-access]

- `execute_nrql_query`: Execute an NRQL query against NRDB.
- `natural_language_to_nrql_query`: Execute a query by converting a natural language request into an NRQL query, executing it, and returning the results.

## Alerts and monitoring (tag: alerting) [#alerts]

- `get_alert_conditions`: Fetch alert condition details for a specific alert policy.
- `search_incident`: List all alert incident events (both open and close events) with flexible filtering.
- `get_alert_policies`: List alert policies for the specified account, optionally filtering by policy name.
- `list_recent_issues`: Lists all open issues in New Relic for the specified account.
- `list_synthetic_monitors`: List all synthetic monitors (automated tests that check your services' availability and performance).

## Incident Response (tag: incident-response) [#incidents]
- `analyze_deployment_impact`: Analyze the performance impact of a deployment on a specific entity.
- `generate_alert_insights_report`: Generate an alert intelligence analysis report for a specific issue.
- `generate_user_impact_report`: Generate an end-user impact analysis report for a specific issue.
- `get_entity_error_groups`: Fetch error groups for a specific entity from the Errors Inbox within a time window.
- `list_change_events`: List a history of change events from New Relic for the application identified by its entity `GUID`.

## Performance analytics  (tag: performance-analytics) [#performance]

- `analyze_entity_logs`: Analyze application logs to identify error patterns, anomalous behavior, and recurring issues.
- `analyze_golden_metrics`: Analyze golden metrics (key health indicators: throughput, response time, error rate, and saturation).
- `analyze_kafka_metrics`: Analyze Kafka metrics including consumer lag, producer throughput, message latency, and partition balance.
- `analyze_threads`: Analyze thread metric data for a given entity including thread state, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
- `analyze_transactions`: Analyze transactions for a specific entity within a time window, identifying slow and error-prone transactions.
- `get_gc_metrics`: Fetch garbage collection (GC) and memory metrics for a given account and entity.
- `list_recent_logs`: List recent logs from New Relic for the specified account and entity `GUID`.

## Advanced analysis (tag: advanced-analysis) [#advanced-analysis]

- `analyze_deployment_impact`: Analyze the performance impact of a deployment on a specific entity.
- `analyze_entity_logs`: Analyze application logs to identify error patterns, anomalous behavior, and recurring issues.
- `generate_alert_insights_report`: Generate an alert intelligence analysis report for a specific issue.
- `generate_user_impact_report`: Generate an end-user impact analysis report for a specific issue.
- `natural_language_to_nrql_query`: Convert a natural language request into an NRQL query, execute it, and return results.
