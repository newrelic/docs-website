New Relic's MCP server provides specialized tools that enable AI agents to access and analyze your observability data. This reference guide organizes all available tools by category.

## How to use MCP tools [#how-to-use]

MCP tools are invoked through natural language queries in your AI development environment. You don't need to memorize exact tool names or parameters. Just describe what you want to know about your New Relic data.

**Example queries:**
- "What entities are in my account?"
- "Show me recent alerts for my web application"
- "What are the top errors from the last hour?"
- "Run an NRQL query to analyze performance"

Your AI tool will automatically select the appropriate MCP tools and format the results for you.

## Filter tools with `include-tags` [#filter-tools]

Some tools appear in multiple categories (for example, `analyze_deployment_impact` is relevant to both `incident-response` and `advanced-analysis`) because they are tagged with multiple relevant tags.

You can dynamically filter the tools your AI agent receives by sending the `include-tags` `HTTP` header with your requests. This allows you to request only specific subsets of tools, which is helpful for reducing the tool corpus and improving the AI model's efficiency and accuracy.

The available tags you can use for filtering correspond directly to the category headers in this reference: `discovery`, `data-access`, `alerting`, `incident-response`, `performance-analytics`, as well as `advanced-analysis`.

### Example implementation [#example]

```json
"servers": {
    "new-relic-mcp-server": {
        "url": "https://mcp.newrelic.com/mcp/",
        "type": "http",
        "headers": {
            "api-key": "NRAK-****",
            "include-tags": "discovery,alerting"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the AI agent will only be presented with tools categorized under discovery (for example, `get_entity`) and alerting (for example, `list_alert_policies`), ensuring that the model focuses only on the most relevant functions for its current task.

<callout variant="important">
  **Security and access:** When your AI agent invokes any tool listed below (for example, `fetch_entity`, `analyze_deployment_impact`, `execute_nrql_query`), the action it performs is strictly governed by the permissions granted to the New Relic user API key or OAuth profile that was configured during setup. The tool can only access the data, entities, and accounts that your corresponding user account has been granted access to via New Relic's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). If your key lacks permissions for a specific action (for example, viewing alerts or executing NRQL), the tool call will fail with a permission error.
