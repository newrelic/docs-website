New Relic AI Knowledge connector enhances the context of the New Relic AI by allowing it to integrate with unstructured data sources such as Confluence documents. While foundation models have general knowledge, you can further improve their responses by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a technique that uses information from data sources to improve the relevancy and accuracy of generated responses.

With New Relic AI Knowledge connector, you can integrate your enterprise knowledge such as Runbooks and Retrodocs. When a query is made, the knowledge connector searches your enterprise data for a more contextual resolution of your query.

**With New Relic AI Knowledge Connector, you can:**

- Resolve incidents faster using relevant context from your knowledge base.
- Get actionable recommendations tailored to your environment.
- Answer critical questions like, who resolved similar issues in the past? Or what are the triage steps for this issue?

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have enabled [New Relic AI](/docs/agentic-ai/new-relic-ai/#enable).
- **Data Synchronization**: To start pushing your knowledge articles to NRAI, use the [1-click Knowledge connectors](/docs/agentic-ai/knowledge-integration/knowledge-connector) or the [Knowledge connector API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-rag).
- **Querying New Relic AI**: NRAI has a Knowledge Connector Tool that helps provide contextual responses to your issue-specific queries.
