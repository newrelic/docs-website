<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

To provide more context-specific answers, New Relic AI can use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through the New Relic AI knowledge connector. While New Relic AI LLMs have a vast general knowledge, RAG enhances their responses.

By setting up the New Relic AI knowledge connector, you can expect tangible outcomes such as faster incident resolution, more accurate and context-aware AI responses, and reduced manual searching across multiple documents. This unified approach helps your team make better decisions and respond to issues more efficiently.

## How it works

/>

Your content and knowledge bases, such as Confluence, are uploaded to the New Relic AI platform. The system follows a three-step process to provide a context-aware answer:

- **Index:** Once your knowledge bases are connected to the New Relic AI platform, the knowledge connector performs an initial indexing of your documents. You can configure this process to run on a recurring basis, ensuring that New Relic AI always has access to the most up-to-date information as your documents evolve.

- **Retrieval:** When you ask a question in New Relic AI, the system searches the indexed content for information relevant to your query. This step ensures that the context is pulled directly from your trusted, internal documentation.

- **Generation:** The system combines the retrieved information with the powerful generative capabilities of the underlying LLM. This synthesis produces a comprehensive and context-aware answer, grounded in your specific data and best practices.

If a query does not require your organizational knowledge, New Relic AI will generate an answer using the underlying LLM's vast general knowledge. In both cases, the goal is to provide you with the most relevant and accurate information possible.

## Key features
With New Relic AI knowledge connector, you can:
- Gain access to relevant context from your internal runbooks and documentation directly within New Relic AI, leading to quicker mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- The answers provided are specific to your environment and based on your own best practices and historical data.
- Easily find solutions to problems that have been solved before. Ask questions like:
  - "Who has resolved similar issues in the past?"
  - "What are the standard triage steps for this type of alert?"
  - "Show me the runbook for a `database connection limit exceeded` error."

## Data security and privacy

  <Callout variant="important">

  At this time, all indexed documents can be retrieved by all users within your organization's New Relic account. Please verify that only appropriate content is indexed, as there's currently no option to restrict access or redact information after indexing.

  </Callout>

Before you begin indexing, ensure that:

* Only documents suitable for organization-wide access are indexed.
* Sensitive information is redacted.
* All the documents to be indexed comply with your organization's internal data security and privacy policies.

## Use cases and value

Here are some New Relic AI tools and a brief overview of how the knowledge connector integration adds value to each:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="retro-docsearch-tool" title="Retro DocSearch">

When a critical incident occurs, you face a time-consuming investigation because historical context is fragmented across multiple sources like Confluence and runbooks.

The knowledge connector integrates all of these disparate sources, transforming the Retro DocSearch tool into a powerful historical intelligence engine that provides all the context in one place. This allows the tool to:

* Provide an immediate summary of an original incident's root cause.
* Present specific actionable steps from the runbook that resolved the issue.
* Identify the names of the experts or teams who solved it before.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="dashboard-analysis-tool" title="Dashboard Analysis">

While the Dashboard Analysis tool provides key insights, its analysis is limited to the data received by the dashboard. It lacks crucial business context, making it difficult to understand the true impact of an issue.

The knowledge connector integration grounds the Dashboard Analysis tool in your company's unique knowledge, acting as a bridge between raw telemetry and your internal documentation. This allows the tool to:

* Explain the business impact using indexed documents that define key business metrics.
* Curate suggestions based on internal runbooks to provide context-specific actionable steps.
* Explain historical context by referencing an indexed Jira ticket or internal document.

</Collapser>

<Collapser id="synthetic-monitor-creation" title="Create Synthetic Monitoring">

This tool generates a basic synthetic monitor creation script, but it lacks an understanding of your organization's unique standards and proprietary information. This creates manual work to ensure compliance and inject authentication tokens.

The knowledge connector integration elevates the tool by giving it access to your company's internal documents. This allows the tool to:

* Automate standardization by applying your company’s rules to the generated script.
* Inject specific non-public information from an indexed runbook or wiki into the monitor's configuration.
* Automatically link the monitor to the relevant runbooks so troubleshooting context is attached to the alert.

</CollapserGroup>

## Prerequisites
To begin using the New Relic AI knowledge connector:
- **Enable New Relic AI:** Before you can configure the knowledge connector, New Relic AI must be enabled for your account.
- **Configure user permissions for indexing:** To manage which users can index data sources (which may have future billing implications), you must grant the appropriate permissions. Users responsible for setting up and managing the knowledge connectors will need the “Org Product Admin” role.

You have two options to assign this role:
- **Apply to an existing user group:** Add the Org Product Admin role to an existing group of users who will be responsible for managing the knowledge connectors.
- **Create a dedicated group:** For more granular control, create a new user group specifically for this purpose and assign the Org Product Admin role to that group.

This flexibility allows your organization to control who has the ability to manage indexed content.

## Configure data source and indexing frequency [#configure]
You can connect your knowledge sources using either pre-built connectors or the [knowledge connector API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-rag) for more custom integrations.

To start indexing Confluence content, you need:

- Confluence URL with your unique Confluence cloud ID: https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/[cloud_id]
- A Confluence API key with the following minimum required scopes:
  - `read:confluence-content.all`
  - `read:confluence-space.summary`
  - `read:content:confluence`
  - `read:content-details:confluence`
- Relevant query parameter using Confluence Query Language (CQL) to filter the list of returned content to be indexed

        </tbody>
      </table>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data synchronization and querying [#data-sync-query]
Once your data source is connected, New Relic will begin to synchronize and index your knowledge articles. After the initial synchronization is complete, your team can begin asking questions through the New Relic AI chat. Additionally, New Relic AI will automatically use the knowledge connector tool to search your indexed documents and provide contextual responses on the “What happened previously?” portion of the [issue page](/docs/alerts/incident-management/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#issue-summary).
