<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

New Relic AI uses large language models (LLMs) and New Relic's data platform to help you understand your system and how to better glean insights about the performance of those systems. It allows you to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and explore telemetry data using plain language.

To provide more context-specific answers, New Relic AI can use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through the New Relic AI knowledge connector. While foundation LLMs have a vast general knowledge, RAG enhances their responses by retrieving relevant information from your external data sources. 

## How it works
The New Relic AI knowledge connector integrates your internal knowledge with the analytical power of New Relic AI through the following three-step process:
- **Index:** The first step is to connect your content and knowledge bases, such as Confluence, to the New Relic AI platform. Once connected, the knowledge connector will perform an initial indexing of your documents. You can configure this process to run on a recurring basis, ensuring that New Relic AI always has access to the most up-to-date information as your documents evolve.
- **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question in New Relic AI, the system searches the indexed content for information relevant to the user's query. This step ensures that the context is pulled directly from your trusted, internal documentation.
- **Generation:** Finally, the system combines the retrieved information with the powerful generative capabilities of the underlying LLM. This synthesis produces a comprehensive and context-aware answer, grounded in your specific data and best practices.

This RAG approach significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the responses, reducing the likelihood of generic or hallucinated answers.

## Key features
With New Relic AI knowledge connector, you can:
- Gain access to relevant context from your internal runbooks and documentation directly within New Relic AI, leading to quicker mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- The answers provided are specific to your environment and based on your own best practices and historical data.
- Easily find solutions to problems that have been solved before. Ask questions like:
  - "Who has resolved similar issues in the past?"
  - "What are the standard triage steps for this type of alert?"
  - "Show me the runbook for a `database connection limit exceeded` error."

  <Callout variant="important">
  
  At this time, all indexed documents can be retrieved by all users within your organization's New Relic account. Before you begin indexing, ensure that the documents you intend to connect comply with your internal data security and privacy policies for use of the services.

## Use cases and value

Here are a few New Relic AI tools and how the knowledge connector integration could enhance each tool.

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="retro-docsearch-tool" title="Retro DocSearch">
 This tool provides a summary of similar past issues, along with links to the retrospective documents. It helps you quickly find relevant information and learn from previous incidents.

### Challenges

When a critical incident occurs, you face time-consuming investigation. You need to understand if this issue has happened before, but the necessary historical context is fragmented across multiple internal documents and tools. You have to manually search through:

  * A separate Confluence page for a retrospective document.
  * A Jira board to find the ticket for the long-term fix.
  * The team's Slack channel history for a discussion on a similar issue.
  * A runbook in a different location, like a dedicated documentation platform.

This manual context-switching and searching not only slows down the resolution process (increasing MTTR) but also introduces the risk of missing crucial pieces of information that could have solved the issue. The Retro DocSearch tool helps but without access to all the indexed sources, its recommendations can be incomplete or lack the full, actionable context.

### How the knowledge connector enhances Retro DocSearch
The New Relic knowledge connector unifies this fragmented knowledge by indexing all of your sources, the tool can provide a single, comprehensive "incident briefing." You can get an immediate summary of:

  * The original incident's root cause.
  * The specific, actionable steps from the runbook that resolved the issue.
  * The names of the experts or teams who solved it before.
  * The status of the long-term fix documented in a Jira ticket.

### The value

The knowledge connector integration transforms the "Retro DocSearch" tool from a simple search function into a powerful historical intelligence engine, ensuring that all available knowledge is leveraged automatically to resolve new incidents faster and more effectively.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="dashboard-analysis-tool" title="Dashboard Analysis">
 This tool summarizes a dashboard with key insights and actionable suggestions.

### Challenges

The Dashboard Analysis tool provides key insights and suggestions based on your telemetry data, but it operates without the crucial context of your business. The tool provides a high-level summary and suggestions, but you still need to connect that to real-world business outcomes, historical context, and actionable internal procedures.

  * **The contextual gap:** The contextual gap is that dashboards show what's happening but not what it means for the business. The connection between technical data and business impact is missing, forcing users to manually piece together context from different sources.
  * **The information silo problem:** When a dashboard identifies an issue, the path to a solution is fragmented. Troubleshooting guides, runbooks, and past incident details are scattered across various platforms, causing slow response times and inefficient context-switching.
  * **The knowledge transfer problem:** Dashboards lack crucial context about service ownership, dependencies, and purpose. This makes it difficult for new team members and non-technical stakeholders to understand the system and collaborate effectively.

### How the knowledge connector enhances Dashboard Analysis

While the Dashboard Analysis tool is good at analyzing the data on the dashboard, it can't analyze the context around it. The knowledge connector can be used to ground the analysis in your business and teams' specific knowledge. When you ask the tool to "Explain this dashboard," it could help you:

  * **Explain the business impact:** The knowledge connector could fetch data from an indexed document that defines key business metrics and how they relate to the technical metrics on the dashboard.
  * **Curate suggestions based on internal runbooks:** If the dashboard shows a high error rate, instead of generic suggestions, the knowledge connector could provide context-specific actionable steps from your internal runbooks.
  * **Explain historical context:** The knowledge connector could reference an indexed Jira ticket or internal document that explains why a certain metric has been historically high or why a specific part of the system is architected in a particular way.

### The value
The knowledge connector integration closes the gap between raw data and actionable knowledge. It empowers you to understand the business impact of an issue and to act decisively with all the necessary context in one place, significantly accelerating incident resolution.

{/* <Collapser id="synthetic-monitor-creation" title="Create Synthetic Monitoring">

The "Create Synthetic Monitoring" tool allows users to generate a New Relic synthetic monitor script using a simple natural language prompt. It automates the initial setup, removing the need for manual configuration and scripting from scratch.

### Challenges

While the tool is excellent for generating a basic synthetic monitor, it operates without an understanding of your organization’s unique standards and requirements. This creates several manual, time-consuming problems:

* **Manual compliance:** The generated script may not follow your company's required naming conventions, security policies, or specific performance thresholds.

* **Lack of actionable context:** The monitor is created, but it doesn't automatically link to the runbooks for the service it's monitoring. When the monitor fails, you still have to manually search for the troubleshooting steps.

* **Repetitive configuration:** Every time a new monitor is created, you have to manually apply the same corporate standards, authentication tokens from a secure vault, or custom alert policies. This is a repetitive, error-prone task that the tool currently doesn't solve.

### How the knowledge connector enhances creating a synthetic monitor

The New Relic knowledge connector elevates the "Create Synthetic Monitoring" tool by giving it access to your organization’s documents. This allows the tool to generate a monitor that is not only functional but also production-ready and fully compliant.

* **Automated standardization:** The connector indexes your internal documents that define monitoring policies, naming conventions, and best practices. When you request a new synthetic monitor, the tool retrieves these standards and applies them automatically to the generated script and its configuration.

* **Injection of proprietary information:** The connector can pull specific, non-public information from an indexed document, such as an internal runbook or a wiki, to inject into the monitor's configuration.

* **Pre-linking to resolution:** The generated monitor can be automatically tagged with information retrieved by the knowledge connector, such as the owning team's name and a link to the relevant runbook. When the monitor fails, this crucial context is already attached to the alert, accelerating the path to resolution.

### The value

The knowledge connector transforms "Create Synthetic Monitoring" from a code generator into a powerful, automated compliance engine. It eliminates manual, repetitive tasks, ensures that all new monitors adhere to internal standards from the start, and directly links monitoring alerts to their resolution context, dramatically improving operational efficiency and reducing time spent on maintenance.

## Prerequisites
To begin using the New Relic AI knowledge connector:
- **Enable New Relic AI:** Before you can configure the knowledge connector, New Relic AI must be enabled for your account.
- **Configure user permissions for indexing:** To manage which users can index data sources (which may have future billing implications), you must grant the appropriate permissions. Users responsible for setting up and managing the knowledge connectors will need the “Org Product Admin” role.

You have two options to assign this role:
- **Apply to an existing user group:** Add the Org Product Admin role to an existing group of users who will be responsible for managing the knowledge connectors.
- **Create a dedicated group:** For more granular control, create a new user group specifically for this purpose and assign the Org Product Admin role to that group.

This flexibility allows your organization to control who has the ability to manage indexed content.

## Configure data source and indexing frequency [#configure]
You can connect your knowledge sources using either pre-built connectors or the [knowledge connector API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-rag) for more custom integrations.

To start indexing Confluence content, you need:

- Confluence URL with your unique Confluence cloud ID: https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/[cloud_id]
- A Confluence API key with the following minimum required scopes:
  - `read:confluence-content.all`
  - `read:confluence-space.summary`
  - `read:content:confluence`
  - `read:content-details:confluence`

## Data synchronization and querying [#data-sync-query]
Once your data source is connected, New Relic will begin to synchronize and index your knowledge articles. After the initial synchronization is complete, your team can begin asking questions through the New Relic AI chat. Additionally, New Relic AI will automatically use the knowledge connector tool to search your indexed documents and provide contextual responses on the “What happened previously?” portion of the [issue page](/docs/alerts/incident-management/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#issue-summary).
