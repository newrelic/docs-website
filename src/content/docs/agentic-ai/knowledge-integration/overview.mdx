<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

New Relic AI uses large language models (LLMs) and New Relic's data platform to help you understand your system and how to better glean insights about the performance of those systems. It allows you to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and explore telemetry data using plain language.

To provide more context-specific answers, New Relic AI can use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through the New Relic AI knowledge connector. While foundation LLMs have a vast general knowledge, RAG enhances their responses by retrieving relevant information from your external data sources. 

## How it works
The New Relic AI knowledge connector integrates your internal knowledge with the analytical power of New Relic AI through the following three-step process:
- **Index:** The first step is to connect your content and knowledge bases, such as Confluence, to the New Relic AI platform. Once connected, the knowledge connector will perform an initial indexing of your documents. You can configure this process to run on a recurring basis, ensuring that New Relic AI always has access to the most up-to-date information as your documents evolve.
- **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question in New Relic AI, the system searches the indexed content for information relevant to the user's query. This step ensures that the context is pulled directly from your trusted, internal documentation.
- **Generation:** Finally, the system combines the retrieved information with the powerful generative capabilities of the underlying LLM. This synthesis produces a comprehensive and context-aware answer, grounded in your specific data and best practices.

This RAG approach significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the responses, reducing the likelihood of generic or hallucinated answers.

## Key features
With New Relic AI knowledge connector, you can:
- **Resolve incidents faster:** Gain immediate access to relevant context from your internal runbooks and documentation directly within New Relic AI, leading to quicker mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- **Get actionable, tailored recommendations:** The answers provided are specific to your environment and based on your own best practices and historical data.
- **Answer critical, context-specific questions:** Easily find solutions to problems that have been solved before. Ask questions like:
  - "Who has resolved similar issues in the past?"
  - "What are the standard triage steps for this type of alert?"
  - "Show me the runbook for a `database connection limit exceeded` error."

  <Callout variant="important">
  
  At this time, all indexed documents can be retrieved by all users within your organization's New Relic account. Before you begin indexing, ensure that the documents you intend to connect comply with your internal data security and privacy policies for use of the services.
  
  </Callout>

## Prerequisites
To begin using the New Relic AI knowledge connector:
- **Enable New Relic AI:** Before you can configure the knowledge connector, New Relic AI must be enabled for your account.
- **Configure user permissions for indexing:** To manage which users can index data sources (which may have future billing implications), you must grant the appropriate permissions. Users responsible for setting up and managing the knowledge connectors will need the “Org Product Admin” role.

You have two options to assign this role:
- **Apply to an existing user group:** Add the Org Product Admin role to an existing group of users who will be responsible for managing the knowledge connectors.
- **Create a dedicated group:** For more granular control, create a new user group specifically for this purpose and assign the Org Product Admin role to that group.

This flexibility allows your organization to control who has the ability to manage indexed content.

## Configure data source and indexing frequency [#configure]
You can connect your knowledge sources using either pre-built connectors or the [knowledge connector API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-rag) for more custom integrations.

To start indexing your Confluence content, you need:

- Confluence URL with your unique Confluence cloud ID: https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/[cloud_id]
- A Confluence API key with the following minimum required scopes:
  - `read:confluence-content.all`
  - `read:confluence-space.summary`
  - `read:content:confluence`
  - `read:content-details:confluence`


To start indexing your Confluence content and benefit from the knowledge connector with New Relic AI, follow the mentioned steps:

      </table>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data synchronization and querying [#data-sync-query]
Once your data source is connected, New Relic will begin to synchronize and index your knowledge articles. After the initial synchronization is complete, your team can begin asking questions through the New Relic AI chat. Additionally, New Relic AI will automatically use the knowledge connector tool to search your indexed documents and provide contextual responses on the “What happened previously?” portion of the [issue page](/docs/alerts/incident-management/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#issue-summary).
