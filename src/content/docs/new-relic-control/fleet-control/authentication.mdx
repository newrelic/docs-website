New Relic Fleet Control requires the use of system identities, which are non-human identities used to authenticate
and establish trust between services and applications.

System identities have two different ways to authenticate. The two supported authentication flows are:
* Private key-signed JSON Web Token (JWT)
* Client credentials

During the Agent Control guided installation process, the first system identity is created using client credentials, which are included in the Helm chart's values. The credentials for this system identity expire after 12 hours. When they expire, the Agent Control Helm chart deployment will fail to authenticate with the Fleet Control service, resulting in the following error:

```
Error getting system identity auth token. The API endpoint returned 400: Expired client secret.
```

In this case, the Helm chart must be updated with new system identity credentials.
```yaml
global:
  cluster: "cluster-name"
  licenseKey: "*************************"
agent-control-deployment:
  identityClientId: "L1_CLIENT_ID"
  identityClientSecret: "L1_CLIENT_SECRET"
  config:
    fleet_control:
      fleet_id: "SAMPLE_FLEET_ID"
      auth:
        organizationId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    subAgents:
      ...
```
