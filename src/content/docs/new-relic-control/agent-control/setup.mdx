<Callout variant="important">
  Agent Control and New Relic Control are now **generally available** for Kubernetes! Support for Linux hosts is also in **public preview** program, pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview

Agent Control simplifies the management of your instrumentation agents. This guide will walk you through the process of installing and uninstalling Agent Control on your Kubernetes cluster or Linux hosts using different methods. 

## Install Agent Control

<Callout title="tip">
For automating Agent Control setup across large-scale infrastructure, see [Set up Agent Control with Terraform](/docs/infrastructure-as-code/terraform/agent-control).
</Callout>

### Guided install
1. Log in to New Relic.
2. Ensure the correct account is selected.
3. In Integrations & Agents, click **Install Agent Control** or search for **Agent Control**.
   
   <img

     src="/images/agent-control-guided-install.webp"
   />

4. Follow the steps to complete the entire installation and configuration process.

<Callout title="tip">
    To install Agent Control, it is mandatory to have a fleet. If you haven't yet created a fleet for this managed entity, you can create a fleet during the instalaltion in the Guided Install or complete the fleet creation process in **New Relic Control**, and then return to this guided installation step.
</Callout>

5. Download the generated configuration to your computer and run the provided command in your terminal to install Agent Control. After installation, click **Continue**.
6. Test the connection to confirm the installation was successful. This step may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

### Note about Authentication

New Relic Control requires the use of system identities, which are non-human identities used to authenticate and establish trust between services and applications.

System identities have two different ways to authenticate. The two supported authentication flows are:
* Private key-signed JSON Web Token (JWT)
* Client credentials

During the Agent Control guided installation process, the first system identity is created using client credentials, which are included in the Helm chart's values. **The credentials for this system identity expire after 12 hours.** 
When they expire, the Agent Control Helm chart deployment will fail to authenticate with the Fleet Control service, resulting in the following error:

```
Error getting system identity auth token. The API endpoint returned 400: Expired client secret.
```

In this case, the Helm chart must be updated with new system identity credentials.
```yaml
global:
  cluster: "cluster-name"
  licenseKey: "*************************"
agent-control-deployment:
  identityClientId: "L1_CLIENT_ID"
  identityClientSecret: "L1_CLIENT_SECRET"
  config:
    fleet_control:
      fleet_id: "SAMPLE_FLEET_ID"
      auth:
        organizationId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    subAgents:
      ...
```

## Verify Installation

Now that Agent Control is installed and running, you're ready to [configure and manage your agents](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/configuration) or deploy changes to your agents using Fleet Control](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/overview).

### Kubernetes

1. Run the following commands to check the status of your pods:

  Agent Control installs sub-agents in a different namespace for security reasons. To verify that everything is working, check that the Agent Control pods are running in the `newrelic-agent-control` namespace and the sub-agent pods are running in a different one (e.g., `newrelic`).


  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -n newrelic-agent-control    # Check Agent Control pods
  kubectl get pods -n newrelic                  # Check sub-agents pods
  ```

2. Log in to New Relic, and go to **Fleet Control**.
3. Go to the Fleets page and select the fleet you chose during installation.
4. In the **Entities** table, confirm that your Kubernetes cluster appears in the list.
5. Verify that the instrumentation status for your cluster is **healthy**.

### Linux

* Check the status of the `newrelic-agent-control` service: 
  
  ```bash
    sudo systemctl status newrelic-agent-control
  ```

  If the service appears in `failed` or `stopped` state, this means the agent got installed but there's an issue preventing its normal operation.
  Check the agent services logs using `journaltctl` (or any similar Linux tool):

  ```bash 
    journalctl -u newrelic-agent-control
  ```
  
  If no insights are available, check how to [run the agent in debug mode](/docs/new-relic-agent-control#debug) to access detailed logs explaining why the service cannot be started. 
* If the service is not installed, try appending `--debug` at the end of the [install command](#cli) and run it again. This will enable verbose logging for the installation script. See if the verbose output has additional context explaining the error.
* Optionally, answer `yes` when asked to send logs to New Relic to help troubleshooting the installation. Once submitted, logs can be accessed with the following NRQL query:
  
  ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Log WHERE hostname = `your-host-name`
  ```

{/* ## Manage Agent Control

### Linux hosts

See the following sections on how to:

* [Start, stop, and restart Agent Control](#start-stop-restart)
* [Upgrade Agent Control](#upgrade)
* [Uninstall Agent Control](#uninstall)

### Start, stop, and restart Agent Control [#start-stop-restart]

Our agent starts automatically after you run the installation script. 

For Linux, ensure you use the correct command for your init system. Select `start`, `stop`, `restart`, or `status` as appropriate. 

Here's an example for Systemd:

```shell
sudo systemctl <start|stop|restart|status> newrelic-agent-control
``` */}

## Uninstall Agent Control [#uninstall]

### Kubernetes

To uninstall Agent Control from your Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands:

<Steps>
<Step>
  #### View installed releases [#list-releases]

  Run the following command to list all installed releases and identify the one for Agent Control:

  ```shell
  helm list --all-namespaces
  ```
</Step>

  <Step>
    #### Uninstall Agent Control [#uninstall-agent-control]

    - Replace `<RELEASE>` and `<NAMESPACE>` with the appropriate values for your installation and environment:

      ```shell
      helm uninstall <RELEASE> -n <NAMESPACE>
      ```

    - For example:
      ```shell
      helm uninstall agent-control-bootstrap -n newrelic
      ```

 </Step>
</Steps>

### Linux hosts

<Callout variant="important">
  The uninstall process typically leaves configuration and other miscellaneous files. Stopping the service beforehand is unnecessary. The uninstall process may take several minutes.
  Example of assets that might not be deleted as part of uninstall:
  * Local and/or remote configuration files: review and remove `/etc/newrelic-agent-control` and `/var/lib/newrelic-agent-control` folders.
  * New Relic CLI: review and remove `/usr/bin/newrelic-cli` binary.
