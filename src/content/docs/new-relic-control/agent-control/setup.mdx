  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

To install Agent Control on one of your Kubernetes clusters, log in to New Relic, go to **Integrations & Agents**, and search for **Agent Control**.

<Callout title="tip">
  For automating Agent Control setup across large-scale infrastructure, see [Set up Agent Control with Terraform](/docs/infrastructure-as-code/terraform/agent-control).
</Callout>

## Guided install
1. Log in to New Relic. 
2. Ensure the correct account is selected.
3. In Integrations & Agents, click **Install Agent Control** or search for **Agent Control**.
4. Select **Kubernetes** as the instrumentation method.
5. On the Select your fleet page, choose the fleet to join for the Kubernetes cluster where you're installing Agent Control, then click **Continue**.
<Callout title="TIP">
    You must choose a fleet before continuing with the installation. If you haven't yet created a fleet for this managed entity, complete the fleet creation process first, and then return to this guided installation step.
</Callout>
6. Provide your license key. If you create a new key, make sure you copy it to your clipboard or save it somewhere safe. You'll need it shortly.
7. Select either **New Relic** or **OpenTelemetry** as your instrumentation source, and then click **Continue**. 
8. Enter your **cluster name**, **namespace**, and then click **Continue**.
9. Download the generated configuration file to your computer and run the provided command in your terminal to install Agent Control. After installation, click **Continue**.
10. Test the connection to confirm the installation was successful. This step may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

### Verify installation [#verify-install]

1. Run the following commands to check the status of your pods:

  Agent Control will install sub-agents on a different namespace for security reasons.
  To verify that everything is working correctly, you will have to check that the Agent Control pods are running in one namespace and the sub-agents pods are running in a different one.

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -n newrelic-agent-control    # Check Agent Control pods
  kubectl get pods -n newrelic                  # Check sub-agents pods
  ```

2. Log in to New Relic, and go to **Fleet Control**.
3. Go to the Fleets page and select the fleet you chose during installation.
4. In the Entities table, confirm that your Kubernetes cluster appears in the list.
5. Verify that the instrumentation status for your cluster is **healthy**.

## Next step
Now that Agent Control is installed and running, you're ready to configure and manage it using Fleet Control.

[Set up Fleet Control](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/overview).

## Uninstall Agent Control [#uninstall]
To uninstall Agent Control from your Kubernetes cluster:

<Steps>
<Step>
  ## View installed releases [#list-releases]

  Run the following command to list all installed releases and identify the one for Agent Control:

  ```shell
  helm list --all-namespaces
  ```
</Step>

  <Step>
    ## Uninstall Agent Control [#uninstall-agent-control]

    - Replace `<RELEASE>` and `<NAMESPACE>` with the appropriate values for your installation and environment:

      ```shell
      helm uninstall <RELEASE> -n <NAMESPACE>
      ```

    - For example:
      ```shell
      helm uninstall agent-control -n newrelic
      ```
