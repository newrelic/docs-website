## Guided install
1. Log in to New Relic. 
2. Ensure the correct account is selected.
3. In Integrations & Agents, click **Install Agent Control** or search for **Agent Control**.
4. Select **Kubernetes** as the instrumentation method.
5. On the Select your fleet page, choose the fleet to join for the Kubernetes cluster where you're installing Agent Control, then click **Continue**.
<Callout title="TIP">
    You must choose a fleet before continuing with the installation. If you haven't yet created a fleet for this managed entity, complete the fleet creation process first, and then return to this guided installation step.

6. Provide your license key. If you create a new key, make sure you copy it to your clipboard or save it somewhere safe. You'll need it shortly.
7. Select either **New Relic** or **OpenTelemetry** as your instrumentation source, and then click **Continue**. 
8. Enter your **cluster name**, **namespace**, and then click **Continue**.
9. Download the generated configuration file to your computer and run the provided command in your terminal to install Agent Control. After installation, click **Continue**.
10. Test the connection to confirm the installation was successful. This step may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

### Verify installation [#verify-install]

3. Go to the Fleets page and select the fleet you chose during installation.
4. In the Entities table, confirm that your Kubernetes cluster appears in the list.
5. Verify that the instrumentation status for your cluster is **healthy**.
