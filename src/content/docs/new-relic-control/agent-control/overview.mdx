<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Agent Control simplifies the management of your New Relic infrastructure-level agents by providing a centralized platform for configuration, updates, and monitoring. This lightweight agent supervisor communicates with New Relic Control to remotely manage your instrumentation fleet, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency acros your systems.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Agent Control currently supports **Kubernetes**, with a public preview for on-host Linux systems in progress.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites
Before you begin deploying Agent Control to your Kubernetes clusters, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Helm 3:** Helm version 3 must be installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).
- **New Relic license key:** You'll need a license key to report telemetry to your New Relic account.
- **Kubernetes cluster name:** Have the name of your Kubernetes cluster ready. You'll reference it during the installation process.
- **Auth Domain Manager:** To set up Agent Control and connect it to Fleet Control, you must have the Authentication Domain Manager role. For more info, refer to [User Management Concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).

<Callout variant="important" title="Environment support">
  Agent Control currently only supports **Kubernetes**. We are working on a public preview for on-host Linux systems, and support for other environments will be added in the future.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution" title="Important: Existing instrumentation">
  If your Kubernetes cluster is already instrumented with New Relic, you must uninstall the existing instrumentation before installing Agent Control. After installing Agent Control, you can use New Relic Control to install and manage all infrastructure agents on the cluster. For guidance on this process, refer to [Manage existing instrumentation with Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/reinstrumentation).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution" title="warning">
  Multiple installations of Agent Control on the same cluster are not supported.
</Callout>

## Compatibility

Agent Control is compatible with:
- Last three minor Kubernetes releases
- Minikube, Kind, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and Google GKE

For system requirements related to the New Relic Kubernetes infrastructure agent and the New Relic OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) collector, refer to:
- [Kubernetes integration: compatibility and requirements](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements)
- [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel)

## Next step
After you've confirmed compatibility and met all the prerequisites, you're ready to [install Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/setup) on your Kubernetes clusters.
