## Overview

Agent Control provides a single, unified platform for managing a wide variety of New Relic and OpenTelemetry agents across your fleets. By centralizing management, you can deploy, configure, and update your instrumentation with ease.

While Agent Control is designed to support both containerized and on-premise environments, support for specific agent types varies. The following table provides a comprehensive overview of which agents can be managed by Agent Control and their support status across environments.

### Current Support

| Agent Type | Purpose | Kubernetes Support | On-host Linux Support |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **New Relic Infrastructure Agent** | Collects system-level metrics from your hosts and containers. | âœ… Yes | âœ… Yes (Public Preview) |
| **New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector (NRDOT)** | Gathers metrics, logs, and traces from various sources and exports them to New Relic. | âœ… Yes | âœ… Yes (Public Preview) |
| **Fluent Bit** | A lightweight log processor and forwarder. | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No |
| **New Relic Prometheus Agent** | Scrapes Prometheus-format metrics from your services and forwards them to New Relic. | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No |
| **New Relic eBPF Agent** | Uses eBPF technology for high-resolution, deep visibility into system activity. | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No |
| **APM Agents (.NET, Java, Node, Python, Ruby)** | Instruments your applications to monitor their performance and track transactions. | ðŸš« No | ðŸš« No |

## Agent details

### New Relic APM Agents

APM agents instrument your applications to monitor their performance, track transactions, and provide code-level visibility. Agent Control allows you to manage these agents across your containers and hosts, ensuring consistent monitoring across your application portfolio.

### Infrastructure, Logging, and Metrics Agents
These agents are designed for collecting telemetry from your hosts, containers, and services, providing deep visibility into your entire infrastructure.

#### New Relic Infrastructure Agent

- Type ID: newrelic/com.newrelic.infrastructure:0.1.0
- Purpose: Collects system-level metrics from your hosts and containers. It also includes integrated functionality for managing other infrastructure-related components.
- Key Use Cases: Monitors CPU, memory, and network usage; collects Kubernetes cluster metrics (via kube-state-metrics); and manages event reporting (nri-kube-events).
- More Info: [Install the Infrastructure Agent.](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/new-relic-guided-install-overview)

#### New Relic Prometheus Agent

- Type ID: newrelic/com.newrelic.prometheus:0.1.0
- Purpose: Scrapes Prometheus-format metrics from your services and forwards them to New Relic.
- Key Use Cases: Collects metrics from services that expose a /metrics endpoint, enabling you to use Prometheus-style monitoring within New Relic.
- More Info: [Prometheus Agent configuration.](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/)

#### Fluent Bit

- Tpe ID: newrelic/io.fluentbit:0.1.0
- Purpose: A lightweight and high-performance log processor and forwarder.
- Key Use Cases: Collects, filters, and routes log data from all your applications and infrastructure to New Relic.
- More Info: [Fluent Bit Log Forwarding.](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/)

#### New Relic eBPF Agent
- Type ID: newrelic/com.newrelic.ebpf:0.1.0
- Purpose: Uses eBPF technology to provide high-resolution, deep visibility into system activity without requiring manual instrumentation.
- Key Use Cases: Observes network connections, process activity, and system calls for enhanced security and performance analysis.
- More Info: [eBPF Agent.](/docs/ebpf/linux-installation/)

### OpenTelemetry Agents

Agent Control provides first-class support for OpenTelemetry, allowing you to manage and configure your collectors and instrumentation directly.

- New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector (NRDOT)

  - Type ID: newrelic/io.opentelemetry.collector:0.1.0
  - Purpose: A custom distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector that gathers metrics, logs, and traces from various sources and exports them to New Relic.
  - Key Use Cases: Provides a single pipeline for collecting all telemetry types from your services and infrastructure.
  - More Info: [OpenTelemetry Collector documentation.](/docs/opentelemetry/nrdot/nrdot-collector/)
