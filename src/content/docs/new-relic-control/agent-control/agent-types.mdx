  Agent Control and New Relic Control are now **generally available** for Kubernetes! Support for Linux and Windows hosts is in **public preview** program, pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview

Agent Control provides a single, unified platform for managing a wide variety of New Relic and OpenTelemetry agents across your fleets. By centralizing management, you can deploy, configure, and update your instrumentation with ease.

While Agent Control is designed to support both Kubernetes and host-based environments, support for specific agent types varies. The following table provides a comprehensive overview of which agents can be managed by Agent Control and their support status across environments.

### Current support

Agent-specific permissions: Agent Control is designed to provide you with flexible permissions management. While Agent Control itself requires a certain level of access to function, the permissions it grants to individual agents are tailored to their specific needs. Below, you can find a breakdown of the permissions required for each agent type.
</Callout>

## Required Permissions per agent type

| Agent Type | Key Permissions Required | Environment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Relic infrastructure agent** | Host-level access for system metrics and Kubernetes API access for cluster data. | Kubernetes / host-based |
| **New Relic OpenTelemetry Collector (NRDOT)** | Permissions depend on specific receivers and exporters. Often requires Kubernetes API access for service discovery. | Kubernetes / host-based |
| **Fluent Bit** | Read access to pod and container logs. | Kubernetes |
| **New Relic Prometheus agent** | Permissions to discover and access service endpoints within the cluster for scraping metrics. | Kubernetes |
| **New Relic eBPF agent** | Elevated privileges (for example, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) to load eBPF programs on the host kernel. | Kubernetes |
| **APM agents (.NET, Java, Node, Python, Ruby)** | *Not currently supported by Agent Control.* | N/A |
