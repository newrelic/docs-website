Pipeline Control cloud rules run in New Relic's infrastructure and process data after it reaches New Relic endpoints. Use cloud rules to drop unwanted data or attributes without managing any infrastructure.

Cloud rules are account-specific, authored using NRQL, and managed through the New Relic UI or NerdGraph API. For processing data before it leaves your network, see [Pipeline Control gateway](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/gateway/overview).

To understand when to use cloud rules versus gateway, see the [Pipeline Control overview](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/overview).

You have two ways to create cloud rules via the New Relic UI: the guided method or by writing your own NRQL query. The guided method provides a step-by-step wizard to help you configure rules, while the NRQL query option allows for custom query creation to filter data precisely. You can manage cloud rules via an API, too. For gateway configuration, refer to the [Gateway documentation](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/gateway/overview).

When creating a rule using the guided method, you can specify the type of data you want to filter, including metrics, events, logs, or traces. Additionally, you can decide where to deploy the rule as a cloud rule running in New Relic’s infrastructure, or as a gateway rule running in your environment. 

<Callout variant="important">
    - Pipeline Control rules only apply to data that arrives from the moment you create the rule, they don't delete data that's [already been ingested](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-data-retention#data-deletion).
    - Gateway rules require deployment of the gateway.
    - You must have the proper role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities to create a rule. For details, refer to the [prerequisites](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/overview/#prerequisites).  Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant RBAC permissions.
    - When creating rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic.

## Via guided method [#via-guided-method]

Follow these steps to create a cloud rule via the guided method:

1. In New Relic, go to New Relic Control and open the **Pipeline Rules** tab.
2. Click **Create a rule**. In the wizard that appears, the guided method is selected by default.
3. Select the type of data you want to filter: **Metrics**, **Events**, **Logs**, or **Traces**, and then click **Next**.
4. Enter the rule name.
5. Select whether you want to drop data or attributes. If you want to drop entire records, select **Drop data**. If you want to drop specific attributes or properties on data that’s otherwise preserved, select **Drop attributes**.
6. Select **Cloud rule** to deploy the rule to New Relic’s infrastructure.
7. Optionally, add a friendly description for your rule.
8. For cloud rules, ensure that the current account is selected.
9. Depending on the telemetry data type you select earlier, perform the following action:
   **For metrics:**
   - Select the metric for which you want to drop data. 
   - Filter data using the NRQL `WHERE` clause to scope the queried data. The `WHERE` clause allows you to add conditional filtering across various data types.
   - If you are dropping attributes, use the drop-down menu to specify the metric attributes.
	**For events:**
   - Select the event for which you want to drop data.
   - Filter data using the NRQL `WHERE` clause to scope the queried data.
   - If you are dropping attributes, use the drop-down menu to specify the event attributes.
	**For logs:**
   - Select the partition for which you want to drop data.
   - Filter data using the NRQL `WHERE` clause to scope the queried data.
     Example for log filtering: `level = 'INFO'`
     This allows you to narrow down your query to specific conditions, such as filtering logs by their log level, error types, or other relevant attributes.  
   - If you are dropping attributes, use the drop-down menu to specify the attributes.
	**For traces:**
   - Filter data using the NRQL `WHERE` clause to scope the queried data.
   - If you are dropping attributes, use the drop-down menu to specify the attributes.
10. Save the rule. The rule is deployed.

## By writing NRQL query [#nrql-query]

Follow these steps to create a cloud rule by writing your own NRQL query:

1. In New Relic, go to New Relic Control and open the **Pipeline Rules** tab.
2. Click **Create a rule**. The Create a new rule wizard appears. The guided method is selected by default.
3. Select **Write a NRQL query**.
4. Enter the rule name.
5. To write your own NRQL query for filtering data, click **Write your query**. The query builder opens up at the bottom.
6. Write your query using the `SELECT` keyword, and test it by clicking **Run**. This will show you an example of the data that will be impacted by this rule in the future when it is ingested. However, the data at-rest will not be affected by the rule that you author. 
7. When satisfied, click **Save rule**. The `SELECT` keyword will be replaced by the `DELETE` keyword upon saving, so that the rule will drop the data that you referenced using `SELECT`.
8. Select **Cloud rule** to deploy the rule to New Relic’s cloud infrastructure.
9. For cloud rule, you’ll also have to select the account to which you want the rule to apply.
10. Click **Save**. The rule is now deployed.

For the list of supported NRQL functions in pipeline rules, refer to [NRQL functions](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/nrql-functions).

## Caution [#caution]

New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Always test and retest your queries and, after the drop rule is created, make sure it works as intended.

Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers).

## Next step
  - For cloud rules, your rule is now deployed and active.
  - For gateway configuration, refer to [Gateway documentation](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/gateway/overview).
  - For gateway infrastructure setup, implement a load balancer for your gateway cluster](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/load-balancer-for-gateway).
