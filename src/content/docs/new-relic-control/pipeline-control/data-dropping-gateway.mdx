{/* Pipeline Control cloud rules and gateway rules sometimes work differently than each other, even when using identical NRQL definitions. 

When telemetry data is received by New Relic, it undergoes multiple transformations and enrichments before the data is assessed by cloud rules and stored in NRDB. But gateway rules run in your own infrastructure before data it’s transformed and enriched by New Relic. This difference in data schema and fidelity can result in gateway rules not working as expected.

When authoring gateway rules, make sure you reference this document while crafting your NRQL definition to convert or remove any attributes that operate differently in the gateway. This may be because attributes have a different name, or because they don’t exist at all. Use this document to search for the attributes that you’re using in your gateway rule NRQL definition to identify.

If an attribute has been renamed, simply use the renamed attribute in your NRQL instead of the original attribute. 

If an attribute is not available, consider using a cloud rule instead of a gateway rule.

To ensure effective data processing:
- Preserve all non-droppable attributes listed in the tables.
- Use sample queries in the tables to manage records without compromising essential attribute integrity. */}

## Data flow overview
### Data sources
Data enters the New Relic gateway from various sources:
- [APM agents](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/modify-agent-configuration/#supported-agent-versions)
- Infrastructure agent
- Metrics API

### Data format
This incoming data is structured as complex, multi-nested JSON with numerous attributes.

### Processing stages
- **Gateway processing:** Initial data handling occurs here in your own infrastructure.
- **Enrichment:** After the gateway, additional attributes are added AND some attribute names are changed.
- **Cloud rules processing:** Processes data with the renamed/enriched attributes in New Relic's environment.
- **Final storage:** Data is ultimately stored in the New Relic database (NRDB).

## Considerations for writing NRQL queries for gateway rules
### Renamed attributes
If you're using attributes that get renamed during the enrichment process (after gateway, before cloud rules), don't worry. New Relic automatically handles this mapping, so your NRQL queries will work correctly at both the gateway and cloud rule levels.

### Added attributes
Some attributes are only added during the enrichment process (after gateway, before cloud rules). These attributes:
- **Can** be used in NRQL queries for cloud drop rules
- **Cannot** be used in NRQL queries for gateway drop rules (since they don't exist at that point)

### Best practices
When [authoring gateway rules](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/create-pipeline-rules.mdx), be aware that some attributes may not be available at the gateway level. If you need to use attributes that are only added during enrichment, consider using a cloud rule instead of a gateway rule.

## Data types and attribute handling
The following table lists:
- Data types for which you can create drop rules using NRQL
- Data types for which drop rules aren't supported
- Attributes unavailable at the gateway level
- Sample queries for each supported data type
