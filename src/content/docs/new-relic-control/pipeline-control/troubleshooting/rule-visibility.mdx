{/* If you've changed a gateway rule and it's not appearing in the rule list, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Undeployed change
You're unaware that the rules list shows only active states and has not deployed the change yet.
## Solution
- Check the updates page for pending gateway updates to deploy.
- Ensure that you deploy your changes for them to be reflected in the rules list.

## Problem: API race condition
Multiple users send requests for gateway updates simultaneously, causing changes to be lost.
## Solution
- Contact [New Relic support](https://support.newrelic.com).
- Redo the action that was lost due to the race condition.
