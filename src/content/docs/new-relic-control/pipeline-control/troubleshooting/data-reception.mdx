{/* If you're receiving no telemetry data from producers configured to send to the gateway, but the gateway is producing its own monitoring data, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Telemetry producer misconfiguration
The telemetry producer is misconfigured, resulting in no telemetry data being sent to the gateway.
## Solution
- Access the producer logs to identify configuration errors.
- Refer to the appropriate API, agent, or telemetry producer documentation for correct configuration steps.

## Problem: I am being rate limited
You're hitting rate limits on your telemetry data.
## Solution
- Check gateway HTTP client response codes for 429 status codes received from the New Relic API.
- Review events created in your account indicating rate limiting.
- Refer to [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/search-results/?query=rate%20limiting&page=2) for guidance on managing and adjusting telemetry data rates.
