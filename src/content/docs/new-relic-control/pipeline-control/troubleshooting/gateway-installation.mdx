{/* If you're trying to install the gateway for the first time and encounter issues, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Insufficient user capabilities
You do not have the necessary permissions associated with Org Product Admin and Organization Manager.
## Solution
- The user will see an error message stating, “You don’t have the required organization-level capabilities to set up the agent authentication.”
- Engage the admin(s) of your account to be granted a role that includes the necessary capabilities for system identity creation.
- Refer to [user permissions documentation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/) for guidance.

## Problem: Outdated Helm chart version
The command line script to install the Helm chart fails because your local version of Helm is outdated.
## Solution
- Update your local Helm installation to the latest version to ensure compatibility with the installation script.
- Look for error messages indicating the need for a Helm update and follow the instructions to upgrade.
