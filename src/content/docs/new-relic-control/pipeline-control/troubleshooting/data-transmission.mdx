{/* If you're experiencing issues with data not being received in New Relic, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: DNS resolution issues between telemetry producer and gateway
Agents are unable to connect to the gateway due to DNS resolution errors.
## Solution
- Access agent logs (via UI or directly) and search for connection errors.
- Consult your network administrator to adjust DNS configurations based on your infrastructure and network topology. Refer to [agent documentation](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/) for more details.

## Problem: Agent-gateway SSL certificate issues
There is a problem with the SSL certificate configuration between the agent and gateway.
## Solution
- Check agent logs for SSL connection errors.
- Ensure SSL certificates are correctly configured and valid, considering your infrastructure and network topology. Refer to [agent documentation](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/) for more details.

## Problem: Gateway misconfiguration
Data reaches the gateway but fails to publish to New Relic.
## Solution
- Check outgoing request and error metrics.
- Review failed rule metrics.
- Inspect logs of pods that are not starting.
- Correct gateway configuration settings and ensure all pods are operational.

## Problem: Unsupported telemetry producer/protocol
Data is sent from an unsupported API or protocol.
## Solution
- Verify compatibility with New Relic. Incorrect API client will return a `501` status code.
- File a feature request for support.
- Configure telemetry producer to send data directly to New Relic.

## Problem: Destructive rule
A rule is dropping all data, preventing it from reaching New Relic.
## Solution
- Check drop data metrics.
- Modify or remove the destructive rule to allow data flow.

## Problem: Data missing
Data is missing in the New Relic backend after ingestion.
## Solution
- Review error metrics and check for client-side timeouts.
- Assess resource exhaustion signs.
- Check [New Relic status](https://status.newrelic.com/).
- Examine gateway logs during the affected time
