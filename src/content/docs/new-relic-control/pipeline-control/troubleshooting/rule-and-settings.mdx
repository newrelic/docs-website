{/* If you've deployed a rule or settings change to your gateway and it's not taking effect as expected, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Invalid NRQL rule
The rule deployed contains invalid NRQL syntax.
## Solution
- Look for failed rule registration events and check the logs of the gateway pod.
- Validate the NRQL in the query builder using `SELECT` instead of `DELETE`, then edit the rule and re-deploy.
- Refer to NRQL documentation for guidance.

## Problem: Wrong config map deployment
A `ConfigMap` containing application configurations was updated with an error.
## Solution
- Check if new deployment pods fail to restart.
- Roll back to the previous working configuration.

## Problem: K8s deployment job unable to complete
New pods with the latest config changes are unable to be scheduled due to resource exhaustion.
## Solution
- Look at the gateway summary page for unhealthy clusters. Use the Kubernetes UI to view pod events and pending jobs.
- Increase node pool sizes or check the resource limit (CPU and memory) requests for pods.
- Verify cloud provider limits for the active number of nodes.

## Problem: Data schema mismatch
The rule is written against data in NRDB with a different schema than in the gateway.
## Solution
- Follow documentation instructions specific to each MELT type to ensure schema compatibility.
