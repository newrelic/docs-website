{/* If you're receiving telemetry data from producers sending to the gateway but no monitoring data from the gateway itself, this guide will help you diagnose and resolve common problems. Follow the steps below based on the specific problem you encounter: */}

## Problem: Invalid license key
The gateway is configured with an invalid license key or one that has been rotated out.
## Solution
- Access gateway logs directly to verify the issue. Look for 403 errors from the internal monitoring pipeline and usage exporter, but not for agent data.
- Ensure the license key is valid and correctly configured. Update the key if necessary.

## Problem: Cloud rule affecting gateway monitoring data
Metrics produced by the gateway are being unintentionally dropped by a cloud rule.
## Solution
- Review usage data from cloud rules to identify any unintended drops.
- Modify cloud rule configuration to exclude gateway metrics from being dropped.

## Problem: I'm being rate limited on metrics API
You may have exceeded their request limit against the metrics API, causing subsequent requests from the gateway to fail with 429 response codes.
## Solution
- Check for rate limiting events related to the OpenTelemetry metrics API in your account.
- Refer to rate limiting documentation for guidance on managing and adjusting request rates.
