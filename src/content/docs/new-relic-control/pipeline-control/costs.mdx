Your use of Pipeline Control is billable in accordance with your Order. The costs associated with this feature are determined by the following factors, as applicable to the pricing model associated with your Account:

**Advanced Compute** (measured in Advanced CCU):
- uncompressed GBs received by the gateway (as a result of configuring agents or telemetry payloads to be sent through the gateway), regardless of whether gateway rules have an effect on the data
- GBs dropped by cloud rules
- events (including metrics, events, logs, and traces) scanned by cloud rules

**Core Compute**: when viewing certain pages in the Pipeline Control UI that generate NRDB queries, measured in Core CCU.

**Data Ingest**: all data not dropped by Pipeline Control and ultimately stored in NRDB, measured in GB Ingested.

For On-Demand Compute customers, Core Compute and Advanced Compute products are made available as the Compute Product, measured as CCU.

For further details on pricing, please contact our sales team or refer to your Order.
