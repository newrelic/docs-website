Your use of Pipeline Control is billable in accordance with your Order. Pipeline Control is sold as part of the Advanced Compute SKU, an add-on layered on top of base pricing models (user-based pricing or Core Compute). Advanced Compute bundles advanced features and charges for them using aCCUs (Advanced Compute Consumption Units).

## How costs are calculated
The costs associated with Pipeline Control are determined by the following factors:

### Gateway metering

Gateway runs on your infrastructure, and metering is straightfoward:

**What's metered**:
- **Data volume received** at gateway endpoints (measured in uncompressed bytes)
- Charged **regardless of what processing is applied** or whether data is dropped
- Metered **on ingress** before any filtering/dropping occurs

### Cloud rules metering

Cloud rules run on New Relic's infrastructure, and are therefore billed at a premium to the gateway.

**What's metered** (for drop rules):
- **GBs dropped**: Volume of data removed by your rules
- **BSEs (billions of scanned events)**: Events evaluated when executing rules
- Both are separate line items that each incur charges
- **BSEs typically represent a much lower fraction** of the overall cloud rules charge compared to GBs dropped for the vast majority of customers

**BSE counting**:
- Only scans data matching the root level `SELECT` in the NRQL rule
- Example: `DELETE FROM Log WHERE level = 'INFO'` only counts BSEs for data in `Log`
- More selective queries scan fewer events

### Other Pipeline Control costs

**Core Compute**: When viewing certain pages in the Pipeline Control UI that generate NRDB queries, measured in Core CCU.

**Data Ingest**: all data not dropped by Pipeline Control and ultimately stored in NRDB, measured in GB Ingested.

For On-Demand Compute customers, Core Compute and Advanced Compute products are made available as the Compute Product, measured as CCU.
