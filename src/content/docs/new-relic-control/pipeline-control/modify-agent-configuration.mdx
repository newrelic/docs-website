For the gateway to process your agents' telemetry data, you have to reconfigure your agents to route their data to your gateway cluster(s) instead of directly to New Relic. To do that, change the endpoint details to point to the gateway using the `NEW_RELIC_HOST` setting, as shown in the sample New Relic NodeJS agent configuration:

```js
'use strict'
/**
 * New Relic agent configuration.
 *
 * See lib/config/default.js in the agent distribution for a more complete
 * description of configuration variables and their potential values.
 */
exports.config = {
  /**
   * Array of application names.
   */
  app_name: ['My Application'],
  /**
   * Your New Relic Host endpoint.
  */
  NEW_RELIC_HOST: 'GATEWAY_DNS_ENDPOINT_HERE',
  /**
   * Your New Relic license key.
   */
  license_key: 'license key here',
  logging: {
    /**
     * Level at which to log. 'trace' is most useful to New Relic when diagnosing
     * issues with the agent, 'info' and higher will impose the least overhead on
     * production applications.
     */
    level: 'info'
  },
  /**
   * When true, all request headers except for those listed in attributes.exclude
   * will be captured for all traces, unless otherwise specified in a destination's
   * attributes include/exclude lists.
   */
  allow_all_headers: true,
  attributes: {
    /**
     * Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard
     * at end.
     *
     * NOTE: If excluding headers, they must be in camelCase form to be filtered.
     *
     * @name NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE
     */
    exclude: [
      'request.headers.cookie',
      'request.headers.authorization',
      'request.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'request.headers.setCookie*',
      'request.headers.x*',
      'response.headers.cookie',
      'response.headers.authorization',
      'response.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'response.headers.setCookie*',
      'response.headers.x*'
    ]
  }
}
```

## Supported data sources
The following table lists the supported data sources for gateway. Note that support for the Gateway feature doesn't override the general [New Relic end-of-life (EOL) policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) or any applicable [agent-specific EOL policies.](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/#eol-agents).
