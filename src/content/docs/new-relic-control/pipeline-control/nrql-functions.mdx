## Examples of NRQL functions in pipeline rules
These examples demonstrate how you can combine multiple functions and use them in more intricate scenarios to achieve precise data filtering and deletion.

- This rule deletes data for containers that have exited, but preserves records for containers that have exited within the last 10 minutes:
```sql
DELETE FROM ContainerSample WHERE state = 'exited' AND status LIKE '%Exited%' AND NOT (status LIKE '%second%' AND numeric(aparse(status,'%Exited (%) * seconds ago%')) < 10) AND NOT (status LIKE '%About a minute ago%' OR status LIKE '%minute%' AND numeric(aparse(status,'%Exited (%) * minutes ago%')) < 10)
```
- This rule deletes logs that are associated with a specific log pattern (`collectd`) and are not custom event types:
```sql
DELETE FROM Log, LogExtendedRecord WHERE dimensions() LIKE '%collectd%' AND newrelic.logs.customEventType IS NULL
```
- This rule deletes a specific type of error log, but samples them by keeping only records where the timestamp is a multiple of 101:
```sql
DELETE FROM Log WHERE message LIKE '%lib/ladon/middleware/caching.rb:49 run> terminated with exception%' AND floor(timestamp/101) = (timestamp/101) AND newrelic.logs.customEventType IS NULL
```

These new functions significantly expand the capabilities of your NRQL queries when working with Pipeline Control gateway, allowing for more precise data analysis and management.
