Set up and deploy the Pipeline Control gateway to manage the flow of data from your monitored entities to New Relic.

## Considerations for using gateway
As you integrate and use the gateway component, here are some important considerations for you to keep in mind:

### Attribute and data management
- **Attribute support:** The gateway uses OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for attributes. Refer to the [gateway documentation](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/gateway/overview) for details on supported attributes.
- **Data/attribute handling:** The gateway forwards your requests for dropping data or attributes for metric time slice data, sql_trace_data, and trace_sample_data directly to New Relic without modification.

### Parsing and data integration
- **Log parsing:** The gateway does not include Grok parsing for logs. Grok parsing is a method used to extract structured data from unstructured log messages using predefined patterns and regular expressions. You may need alternative methods to structure log data for querying and visualization.
- **Prometheus integration:** The gateway does not support Prometheus remote write for metrics, which may affect your integration with Prometheus-based systems.

### Licensing and compliance
- **License key management:** The gateway does not accommodate multiple license keys from native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) sources, such as agent collectors or APM SDKs. Consider this when managing your licenses.
- **Compliance standards:** The gateway isn't FedRAMP-compliant, which may affect your use if you need to meet federal security standards.

## Set up Pipeline Control gateway [#set-up-gateway]

To set up Pipeline Control gateway:

1. In your New Relic account, in Integrations & Agents, click **Set up Pipeline Control**, or search for **gateway** and select **Pipeline Control gateway**. 
2. Ensure the account selected is the one you want to use for Pipeline Control. If not, click **Select an account**, select the account of your choice, and then click **Continue**.
3. To enter your credentials, provide an existing license key or create a new key, and then click **Continue**.  
4. Select an existing Kubernetes cluster using the drop-down menu, or create a new one.
5. If you create a new cluster, enter the cluster name and namespace. The default namespace is `newrelic`.
6. Download the configuration file, `values-newrelic-gateway.yaml` to a directory.
7. Run the installation command shown on screen:
    
    ```bash
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com && helm repo update && \
    helm upgrade --install agent-control --version <VERSION_NUMBER> -n newrelic \
    newrelic/agent-control --create-namespace --values /path/to/values-newrelic-gateway.yaml --devel
    ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
        Replace `<VERSION_NUMBER>` with the actual version number of the gateway and `/path/to/values-newrelic-gateway.yaml` with the directory where the configuration file is located. 
    </Callout>
8. Click **Continue**.
9. Click **Test connection** and wait for a successful connection.

When you create your first gateway cluster, it sets up a unified configuration across all gateway clusters within your organization. 

To view details of your gateway setup, go to New Relic Control and click **Gateway**.

## Use case: Optimize data flow across multiple regions
Imagine you're a customer managing a sophisticated observability setup with New Relic. Your operations span multiple geographic regions, each with its own unique data management challenges. Specifically, you operate Kubernetes clusters across two primary regions: Region A and Region B.

**Objective:** Optimize data handling and reduce unnecessary data transfer to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.
**Current setup:** You already have a gateway cluster (GC1) deployed. Your data-producing Kubernetes clusters in Region A are configured to route all telemetry data through GC1. This setup allows you to filter out irrelevant data, ensuring that only critical signals are sent to the New Relic backend.
**Challenge with Region B:** Your Kubernetes clusters in Region B also need data processing. You have considered utilizing GC1 for Region B's data, but this introduces some inefficiencies:
- **Increased latency:** Data sent from Region B to Region A adds delay, which can impact real-time monitoring capabilities.
- **Higher costs:** Inter-region data transfer may incur additional egress costs, increasing operational expenses.
**Solution:** Deploy multiple gateway clusters:
- Deploy a new gateway cluster (GC2) in Region B.
- Configure your Kubernetes clusters in Region B to filter their data through GC2. This reduces the distance data travels, minimizes latency, and eliminates inter-region transfer fees.
**Outcome:**
- **Improved performance:** Deploying GC2 locally in Region B can help to reduce data transmission delays, which may lead to improved reaction time for critical events.
- **Scalable architecture:** Adding GC2 provides capacity.

This strategy of deploying multiple, region-specific gateway clusters helps maintain streamlined operations and ensures your data monitoring remains both effective and economical.

## Add more clusters
To add a new cluster to your gateway setup, 
1. Open New Relic Control, and then select **Gateway**.
2. In the clusters table, click **Add a cluster**.
3. Follow the instructions in the [gateway setup](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/set-up-and-deploy-pipeline-control#set-up-gateway).
4. Come back to the gateway summary page. You should see your newly added cluster. 

After you have created your gateway clusters, configure pipeline processing using YAML configuration. Refer to [Gateway configuration](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/gateway/overview).
