Pipeline Control is the data management component of New Relic Control. It can help filter and discard low-value data before it is ingested to the New Relic platform.  

Pipeline Control consists of two sub-components: Pipeline Control gateway (simply referred to as the gateway) and Pipeline Control cloud rules.

The gateway is designed to filter data or attributes before they leave your network.  The cloud rules perform that processing within the New Relic cloud. In both scenarios, Pipeline Control uses an identical NRQL query syntax to process data.

To use the gateway, you have to set it up in your environment first. The cloud rules involves no setup.

To understand the costs associated with using Pipeline Control, refer to [Pipeline Control costs](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/costs).

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, you must have:
- A New Relic account with organization product admin and organization manager permissions

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
  The organization product admin and organization manager user roles are required to:
  - Install gateway
  - Add clusters to a gateway
  - Update gateway (for example, new rules and settings changes)
  - Deploy a gateway configuration
  - View gateway rules
</Callout>

- Familiarity with Kubernetes operations and management
- Kubernetes cluster admin access to deploy and manage resources within your cluster
- Permissions to create and manage private DNS hostnames within your network
- Permissions to create and manage DNS records
- Helm installed locally
- Understanding of NRQL to create and manage pipeline rules

<Callout variant="important">
    - Pipeline Control rules only apply to data that arrives from the moment you create the rule, they don't delete data that's [already been ingested](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-data-retention#data-deletion).
    - When creating rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic.
