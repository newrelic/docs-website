Follow these steps to set up a private DNS hostname for the gateway cluster to facilitate reliable communication between New Relic APM agents and the gateway within your network:

1. Create a DNS hostname using [AWS Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html).
2. Obtain a certificate for the gateway hostname via [ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-public-certificates.html).
