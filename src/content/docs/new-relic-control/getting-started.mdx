New Relic Control is an observability management solution that provides centralized, scalable control over agents and telemetry pipelines across your environment. This documentation covers the solution components, core functionality, and deployment options.

## Components
- **[Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview):** A lightweight supervisor component that manages other New Relic and New Relic distribution of OpenTelemetry agents. It communicates with Fleet Control to remotely configure, update, and monitor the health of infrastructure-level instrumentation.
- **[Fleet Control](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/overview):** A centralized interface that provides visibility and remote management of all supervised agents across your infrastructure. It enables teams to install, configure, monitor, and upgrade agents at scale.
- **[Pipeline Control](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/overview):** The data management component of New Relic Control that helps filter and discard low-value data prior to database ingestion.

Pipeline Control is in general availability (GA) and can be used to manage data from APM agents by dropping low-value data. For details on supported agents, refer to [Supported agent versions](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/modify-agent-configuration/#supported-agent-versions)

## Required permissions
- **Agent Control:** Requires the Authentication Domain Manager role to set up Agent Control and connect it to Fleet Control. For more information, refer to [User Management Concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).
- **Fleet Control:** Requires the Organization Manager role (referred to as Administrative setting in the product) to create and edit fleets within Fleet Control.
- **Pipeline Control:** Requires the Organization Manager role to set up and manage Pipeline Control gateway and Pipeline Control rules.
