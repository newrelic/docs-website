The New Relic RabbitMQ [on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) reports metrics and configuration data from your RabbitMQ service, including important metrics relating to the cluster, vhosts, queues, exchanges, and consumers.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with:

* RabbitMQ version 3.0 or higher for Metric data.
* RabbitMQ version 3.7 or higher for Inventory data.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* RabbitMQ [Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) configured.
* RabbitMQ command line tool, [rabbitmqctl](#rabbitmqctl), in the `PATH` of the root user.
* If RabbitMQ is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host running RabbitMQ. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

    title="Windows"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-rabbitmq` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-rabbitmq/nri-rabbitmq-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-rabbitmq/nri-rabbitmq-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-rabbitmq-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp rabbitmq-config.yml.sample rabbitmq-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `rabbitmq-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `rabbitmq-config.yml`.

For an example configuration, see [Example config file](#example-config).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
</Callout>

### Commands

The configuration provides three commands:

* `all`: collects all performance metric data, inventory (configuration) data, and event data
* `inventory`: collects only inventory (configuration) data
* `events`: collects only event data

**Cluster environments**

In cluster environments, only one node should use the `all` command; the rest should use the `inventory` command.

If you're running a cluster environment in Kubernetes, you need to deploy RabbitMQ as a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/), and configure the agent to query all the metrics from the RabbitMQ pod. Set the autodiscovery matching condition [in the config file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-rabbitmq/blob/master/rabbitmq-config.yml.k8s_sample) to this value:

```
discovery:
  command:
    exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes
    match:
      podName: rabbitmq-0
```

### Arguments

The integration accepts the following arguments:

* `hostname`: hostname or IP of the RabbitMQ management plugin. Default: localhost.
* `port`: port number of the RabbitMQ management plugin. Default: 15672.
* `username`: user that is connecting to RabbitMQ management plugin.
* `password`: password to connect to RabbitMQ management plugin.
* `use_ssl`: option to connect using SSL. Default: false.
* `ca_bundle_dir/ca_bundle_file`: location of SSL certificate on the host.
* `node_name_override`: overrides the local node name instead of retrieving it from RabbitMQ.
* `config_path`: absolute path to the RabbitMQ configuration file.
* `queues`: queue names to collect in the format of a JSON array of strings. If a queue name exactly matches (case sensitive) one of these, it will be collected.

  Example:

  ```
  queues: '["myQueue1","myQueue2"]'
  ```
* `queues_regexes`: queue names to collect in the format of a JSON array of REGEX strings. If a queue name matches one of these, it will be collected.

  Example:

  ```
  queues_regexes: '["queue[0-9]+",".*"]'
  ```
* `exchanges`: exchange names to collect in the format of a JSON array of strings. If an exchange name exactly matches (case sensitive) one of these, it will be collected.
* `exchanges_regexes`: queue names to collect in the format of a JSON array of REGEX strings. If an exchange name matches one of these it will be collected.
* `vhosts`: vhost names to collect in the format of a JSON array of strings. If a vhost name exactly matches (case sensitive) one of these, it will be included. This also affects only collecting entities belonging to vhosts specified.
* `vhosts_regexes`: vhost names to collect in the format of a JSON array of REGEX strings. If a vhost name matches one of these the vhost and any entities belonging to this vhost will be collected.

### Labels

Labels are optional, custom tags used to identify collections of data. For example:

* `env`: label to identify the environment. For example: `production`.
* `role`: label to identify which role is accessing the data.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The integration captures the configuration parameters of RabbitMQ in the `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` file. Inventory data is only captured in [RabbitMQ version 3.7](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2018/02/05/whats-new-in-rabbitmq-3-7/) or higher; the [inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) will appear on the Infrastructure [**Inventory** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the `config/rabbitmq` source.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Be aware that any sensitive information that you put into the `rabbit.conf` file will appear on the Infrastructure **Inventory** page. This includes items such as the following from AWS:

  ```
  cluster_formation.aws.secret_key, 
  cluster_formation.aws.access_key_id
  ```
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshoot]

Troubleshooting tips:

<CollapserGroup id="troubleshooting-list">
  <Collapser
    id="rabbitmqctl-error"
    title="Error getting local node name: exec: \&quot;rabbitmqctl\&quot;: executable file not found in $PATH"
  >
    If you receive this error, it means that the RabbitMQ command line tool, [rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html), is not in the PATH of the root user. To correct this issue, execute the following command:

    ```
    find -name "rabbitmqctl"
    export PATH="$PATH:<var><LOCATION_TO_RABBITMQCTL></var>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-rabbitmq "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
