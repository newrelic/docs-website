Our Memcached [integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Memcached instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at both instance and slab levels.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with Memcached 1.4 or higher.

If Memcached is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host that's running Memcached. Otherwise:

* If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
* If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the Memcached integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-memcached`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp memcached-config.yml.sample memcached-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `memcached-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows"

    1. Download the `nri-memcached` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-memcached/nri-memcached-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-memcached/nri-memcached-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-memcached-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp memcached-config.yml.sample memcached-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `memcached-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `memcached-config.yml`.

Config options are below. For an example configuration, see [Example config file](#example-config).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
</Callout>

### Commands

The configuration accepts the following commands:

* `all_data`: collects both inventory and metrics for the Memcached instance.
* `inventory`: collects only the inventory (configuration) data for the Memcached instance.
* `metrics`: collects only the metrics data for the Memcached instance.

### Arguments

The commands accept the following arguments:

* `username`: The username for the Memcached connection. Default: `no authentication`
* `password`: The password for the Memcached connection. Default: `no authentication`
* `hostname`: The hostname for the Memcached connection. Default: `localhost`.
* `port`: The port on which the Memcached instance is running. Default: `11211`.

### Example configuration [#example-config]

Example `memcached-config.yml` file configuration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example"
    title="Example configuration"
  >
    ```
    integration_name: com.newrelic.memcached

    instances:
      - name: memcached
        # Command can be all_data, metrics, or inventory
        command: all_data
        arguments:
          # Hostname of the memcached instance.
          # Defaults to localhost.
          host: memcached_host
          # Port memcached is running on.
          # Defaults to 11211
          port: 11211
          # Memcached SASL username. Only required if 
          # authentication is enabled.
          username: cacheuser
          # Memcached SASL password. Only required if 
          # authentication is enabled.
          password: password
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see [Configuration](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to these [event types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `MemcachedSample`
* `MemcachedSlabSample`

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The Memcached integration captures the configuration parameters of the memcached instance. The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/memcached** source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

The integration captures data for the following Memcached configuration parameters:
