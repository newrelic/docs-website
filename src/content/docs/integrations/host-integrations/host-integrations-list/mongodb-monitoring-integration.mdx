Our MongoDB [integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MongoDB cluster to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data on mongos, mongods, and config servers, as well as on databases and collections to help pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with MongoDB v3.0+. MongoDB Atlas is supported for tiers M10 and above.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* MongoDB user with [`clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles](#users-privileges).
* If MongoDB is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host that's running MongoDB. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## MongoDB users and privileges [#users-privileges]

In the [MongoDB shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/), execute the following commands to create a `listCollections` role and a new user, then assign `clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles to the new user. Note: username, password, and similar user-specific values must be replaced.

See the MongoDB documentation for details on [creating users](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/index.html) and [roles](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createRole/index.html).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Complete these steps on the mongos to be monitored. If mongod-level metrics are to be collected, such as host or replica set statistics, create the role and user on each mongod as well.
</Callout>

1. In the MongoDB shell, enter `use admin`.
2. Use the following command to create the `listCollections` role.

   ```
   db.createRole({
       role: "listCollections",
       privileges: [{
           resource: {db:"",collection:""},
           actions: ["listCollections"]
       }],
       roles: []
   })
   ```
3. Use the following commands to create a new user, and assign `clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles to the user.

   ```
   db.createUser({
       user: "username",
       pwd: "password",
       roles: [
           "clusterMonitor",
           "listCollections"
       ]
   })
   ```

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the MongoDB integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>

       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy of the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp mongodb-config.yml.sample mongodb-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `mongodb-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-mongodb` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mongodb/nri-mongodb-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mongodb/nri-mongodb-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\TO\nri-mongodb-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp mongodb-config.yml.sample mongodb-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `mongodb-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `mongodb-config.yml`.

Config options are below. For an example configuration, see [Example config file](#example-config).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
</Callout>

### Commands

The configuration accepts the following configuration commands:

* `all`: captures inventory and metrics for each node in the Mongo cluster.
* `inventory`: captures only the inventory for each node in the cluster.
* `metrics`: captures only the metrics for each node in the cluster.

### Arguments

The commands accept the following arguments:

* `cluster_name`: A user-defined name to uniquely identify the cluster being monitored. **Required**.
* `username`: The username for the MongoDB connection. Note: this should be the user entered above.
* `password`: The password for the MongoDB connection. Note: this should be the password entered above.
* `authSource`: The database to authenticate against. Default: `admin`.
* `host`: The hostname on which a MongoDB instance is running. Default: `localhost`.
* `port`: The port on which a MongoDB instance is running. Default: `27017`.
* `ssl`: Indicates whether SSL is enabled. Default: `false`.
* `ssl_ca_certs`: Path to a Certificate Authority (CA) file, if SSL is enabled.
* `ssl_insecure_skip_verify`: Skip verification of the certificate sent by the host. This can make a connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and should only be used for testing. Default: `false`.
* `filters`: A JSON map of database names to an array of collection names. If empty, defaults to all databases and collections. If the list of collections is null, collects all collections for the database. Example: `{"db1":null,"db2":["collection1","collection2"],"db3":[]}`.
* `concurrent_collections`: The number of entities to collect metrics for concurrently. Used to tune down CPU and memory requirements. Default: `50`.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The MongoDB integration can be configured to monitor either a full MongoDB cluster or a standalone MongoDB instance. To monitor a cluster, the `host` and `port` [arguments](#arguments) should point to one of the `mongos` instances in your cluster.

  If you want to instead monitor a standalone instance, `host` and `port` should point to the `mongod` running the database.
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to these [event types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `MongoCollectionSample`
* `MongoConfigServerSample`
* `MongoDatabaseSample`
* `MongodTopSample`
* `MongoSample`
* `MongodSample`
* `MongosSample`

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The MongoDB integration collects the following metric data attributes. Some metric name are prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as `asserts.` or `collection.`.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Different metrics are available depending on whether a cluster or a standalone instance is being monitored. For a standalone instance, only [MongodSample](#mongod-clamshell), [MongoDatabaseSample](#mongo-database-clamshell), [MongodTopSample](#mongo-top-clamshell) and [MongoCollectionSample](#mongo-collection-clamshell) are collected. For a cluster, all event types are collected.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The MongoDB integration captures all command line options and runtime-configured parameters from each host in the cluster.

The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/mongodb** source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mongodb "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
