The New Relic PostgreSQL [on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher.

If PostgreSQL is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host running PostgreSQL. Otherwise:

* If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
* If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the procedures to [install the infrastructure integration package](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic) using the file name `nri-postgresql`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy of the [sample configuration file](#example-postgresSQL-config):

       ```
       sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `postgresql-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, [create a user](#create-user) with `READ` permissions on the required functions.
    6. [Restart the infrastructure agent.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"

    1. Download the `nri-postgresql` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-postgresql-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `postgresql-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## PostgreSQL users and permissions [#create-user]

Create a user with `SELECT` permissions on:

* `pg_stat_database`
* `pg_stat_database_conflicts`
* `pg_stat_bgwriter`

You can complete this step before or after you [configure the `postgresql-config.yml` file](#config). To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration:

```
CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD '<var>PASSWORD</var>';
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic;
```

This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance.

If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (`new_relic`) also needs `SELECT` permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public `schema`), use the following:

```
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic;
```

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `postgresql-config.yml`.

Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the [example config file](#example-postgresSQL-config).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
</Callout>

### Commands

The configuration accepts the following commands:

* `all_data`: collects both inventory and metric data for the configured PostgreSQL instance..

### Arguments

The `all_data` command accepts the following arguments:

* `username`: the user name for the PostgreSQL connection. **Required.**
* `password`: the password for the PostgreSQL connection. **Required.**
* `hostname`: the hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. Default: `localhost.`
* `port`: the port where PostgreSQL is running. Default: `5432`.
* `collection_list`: a JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal `ALL` that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has `SELECT` permissions for. **Required except for PgBouncer.**

  * JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example:

    ```
    collection_list: '["postgres"]'
    ```
  * JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are `database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name`. For example:

    ```
    collection_list: '{"postgres":{"public":{"pg_table1":["pg_index1","pg_index2"],"pg_table2":[]}}}'
    ```
  * `ALL`: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example:

    ```
    collection_list: 'ALL'
    ```
* `pgbouncer`: collect `pgbouncer` metrics. Default: `false`.
* `enable_ssl`: determines if SSL is enabled. If `true`, `ssl_cert_location` and `ssl_key_location` are required. Default: `false`.
* `trust_server_certificates`: if `true`, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If `false`, the server certificate identified in `ssl_root_cert_location` is verified. Default: `false`.
* `ssl_root_cert_location`: absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if `trust_server_certificates` is `false`.
* `ssl_cert_location`: absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if `enable_ssl` is `true`.
* `ssl_key_location`: absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if `enable_ssl` is `true`.
* `timeout`: maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to `0` for no timeout. Default: `10`.
* `database`: the PostgreSQL database to connect to. Default: `postgres`.
* `custom_metrics_query`: a SQL query that required `columns metric_name`, `metric_type`, and `metric_value.metric_type` can be `gauge`, `rate`, `delta`, or `attribute`. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes.
* `custom_metrics_config`: a path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details.
* `collect_db_lock_metrics`: Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: `true`.
* `collect_bloat_metrics`: Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. Default: `true`.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from `pg_settings` along with its `boot_val` and `reset_val`. The [inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) appears on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/postgresql** source.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration:

* If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with `psql`.
* If you have problems collecting `PgBouncer` metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through `PgBouncer`. Default port is `6432`.
* If you get the error message `Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits`, set `ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits` in the PgBouncer config file.

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-postgresql "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
