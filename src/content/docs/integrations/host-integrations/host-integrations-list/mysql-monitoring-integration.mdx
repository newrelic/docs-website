Our MySQL [integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#req]

Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* If MySQL is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux OS host that's running MySQL. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

<Callout variant="important">
  For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: `cluster.slaveRunning`, `db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes`, `db.qCacheHitRatio`, `db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond`.
</Callout>

## Quick start [#quick]

The quickest way to get started is through our guided install.

<Callout variant="tip">
	Try our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.home?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5ob21lLXNjcmVlbiJ9&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGlvbkluZGV4IjoxfQ==) for yourself. (If you're hosted in the EU, use our [EU guided install](https://one.eu.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.home?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5ob21lLXNjcmVlbiJ9&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGlvbkluZGV4IjoxfQ==).)
</Callout>

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-mysql`.
    2. From the command line, create a user with [replication privileges](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client):

       ```
       sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<var>YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD</var>';"
       ```

       ```
       sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
       ```
    3. Change the directory to the integration's folder.

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    4. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml
       ```
    5. [Edit the configuration file](#config) `mysql-config.yml` as explained in the next section.
    6. [Restart](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) the infrastructure agent.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:
  * **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
  * **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
  

## Configuration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `mysql-config.yml`.

The configuration provides a single command, `status`, that captures the metrics and all the config options. It accepts these arguments:

* `hostname`: the MySQL hostname.
* `port`: the port where the MySQL server is listening.
* `username`: the user connected to the MySQL server. If you used the `CREATE USER` command in the [activation instructions](#install), this should be set to `newrelic`.
* `password`: the password for the user specified above.
* `extended_metrics`: captures an [extended set of metrics](#extended). Disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable. This also enables the capture of [slave metrics](#slave).
* `extended_innodb_metrics`: captures [additional innodb metrics](#extended_innodb). Disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable.
* `extended_myisam_metrics`: captures [additional MyISAM metrics](#extended_myisam). Disabled by default. Set to `1` to enable.
* Optional: `labels` field. For example, the `env` label controls the `environment` inventory data. The default value is `production`.
* Optional: `metrics` field. Set to `1` to disable the collection of inventory.

See a sample of a [configuration file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql/blob/master/mysql-config.yml.sample).

### Activate remote monitoring [#remote-monitoring]

The `remote_monitoring` parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration.

This parameter is enabled by default and should not be changed unless you require it in your custom environment.

Activating `remote_monitoring` may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see [remote monitoring in on-host integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/remote-monitoring-host-integrations).

<Callout variant="important">
  Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use `remote_monitoring`.
</Callout>

### Environment variable passthroughs [#environment-variables]

Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see [Configure the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#passthrough).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to the `MysqlSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The MySQL integration collects the following metrics:

### Default metrics

## Inventory

The MySQL integration captures the configuration parameters of the MySQL node returned by `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES`. The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the `config/mysql` source.

## System metadata [#metadata]

The MySQL integration collects the following metadata [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) about your MySQL system:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.edition`
      </td>

      <td>
        `software.edition` takes the value of the MySQL `version_comment` variable.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.version`
      </td>

      <td>
        The MySQL server version.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `cluster.nodeType`
      </td>

      <td>
        Either `master` or `slave,` depending on the role of the MySQL node being monitored.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Source code

The MySQL integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql) and [send improvements](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), or create your own fork and build it.
