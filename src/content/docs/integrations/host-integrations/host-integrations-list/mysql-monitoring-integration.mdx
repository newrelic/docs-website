Our MySQL [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#req]

Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* If MySQL is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

<Callout variant="important">
  For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: `cluster.slaveRunning`, `db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes`, `db.qCacheHitRatio`, `db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond`.
</Callout>

## Quick start [#quick]

Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

![A screenshot of the guided install CLI.](./images/guided-install-cli.png "The guided install CLI.")

Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument.

The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database.

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-mysql`.

    2. Change the directory to the integration's folder.

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml
       ```
    4. [Edit the configuration file](#config) `mysql-config.yml` as explained in the next section.
    5. [Restart](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) the infrastructure agent.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-mysql` .MSI installer image from:

       [https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-mysql-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `mysql-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:
  * **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
  * **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configuration [#configuration]

### Enabling your MySQL Server [#enable-instance]

To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client) and [select](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics:

From the command line, create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password.

```
sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<var>YOUR_PASSWORD</var>' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
```

Grant replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

```
sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
```

Grant privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

```
sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
```
<Callout variant="tip">
In case you want to enable [REMOTE_MONITORING](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mysql-monitoring-integration/#instance-settings), you need to change your `localhost` when granting permisions by the server from where you want to monitor the MySQL instance.
</Callout>
 
### Configure the integration [#config]

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `nginx-config.yml`.

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this [document](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/) for help.

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:
* Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way.
* Replace the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on [infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough).
* Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Labels and custom attributes [#labels]

You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics.

Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones.

```
 labels:
   env: production
   role: load_balancer
```

## Inventory

The MySQL integration captures the configuration parameters of the MySQL node returned by `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES`. The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the `config/mysql` source.

## System metadata [#metadata]

The MySQL integration collects the following metadata [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) about your MySQL system:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.edition`
      </td>

      <td>
        `software.edition` takes the value of the MySQL `version_comment` variable.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.version`
      </td>

      <td>
        The MySQL server version.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `cluster.nodeType`
      </td>

      <td>
        Either `master` or `slave,` depending on the role of the MySQL node being monitored.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Source code

The MySQL integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql) and [send improvements](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), or create your own fork and build it.
