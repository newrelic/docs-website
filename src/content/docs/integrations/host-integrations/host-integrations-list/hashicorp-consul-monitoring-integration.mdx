The HashiCorp Consul [on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Consul environment to New Relic, where you can see the health of your Consul datacenter environment. We collect data on both the datacenter and agent/node levels.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with HashiCorp Consul 1.0 or newer.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* If Consul is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host running Consul. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If using ACL, the credentials for the Consul integration must have the following policies: `agent:read`, `node:read`, and `service:read`.

## Quick start [#quick]

Instrument your Consul environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the HashiCorp Consul integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument.

The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Consul environment.

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the HashiCorp Consul integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-consul`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp consul-config.yml.sample consul-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `consul-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-consul` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-consul/nri-consul-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-consul/nri-consul-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-consul-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp consul-config.yml.sample consul-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `consul-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `consul-config.yml`.

Config options are below. For an example configuration, see [Example config file](#example-config).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
</Callout>

### Commands

The configuration accepts one command:

* `all_data`: collects both inventory and metrics for the HashiCorp Consul environment.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you run a cluster environment in Kubernetes and use autodiscovery to monitor Consul pods, you may receive duplicated cluster data. [Facet by node](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) for creating dashboards and alerts.
</Callout>

### Arguments

The configuration command accepts the following arguments:

* `hostname`: The hostname or IP of a Consul node within the cluster. Defaults: `localhost`. **Required**.
* `port`: Port to connect to node on. Default: `8500`. **Required**.
* `fan_out`: Whether to connect to other Consul agents to collect node data from them. Default: `true`.
* `token`: ACL Token if token authentication is enabled.
* `enable_ssl`: Whether or not to connect using SSL. Default: `false`.
* `trust_server_certificate`: If set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied CA Bundles. Default: `false`.
* `ca_bundle_file`: Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file, required if `enable_ssl` is set to `true` and `trust_server_certificate` is set to `false`.
* `ca_bundle_dir`: Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory, required if `enable_ssl` is set to `true` and `trust_server_certificate` is set to `false`.

### Example configuration [#example-config]

Example `consul-config.yml` file configuration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example"
    title="Example configuration"
  >
    ```
    integration_name: com.newrelic.consul

    instances:
      - name: consul-prod
        command: all_data
        arguments:
          hostname: consul-dev-0.consul.localnet
          token: my_token
        labels:
          env: production
          role: consul
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see [Configuration](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to these [event types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `ConsulDatacenterSample`
* `ConsulAgentSample`

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The HashiCorp Consul integration captures the configuration parameters and current settings of the Consul Agent nodes. It collects the results of the `/v1/agent/self` REST API endpoint. It pulls the `Config` and `DebugConfig` sections from that response.

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Note**: Nested sections within `Config` and `DebugConfig` are not collected.
