## Problem

You have config parameters defined in the infrastructure agent and you want to pass the parameters to an [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations).

## Solution

You can pass config parameters set in the agent to on-host integrations by adding the variable `passthrough_environment` to the infrastructure agent's [configuration file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#config-file).

For example, if you want to pass the proxy options configured in the infrastructure agent to an integration, add the following configuration to the infrastructure config file:

```
passthrough_environment:
  - HTTPS_PROXY
  - HTTP_PROXY
```
