New Relic's [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) are a type of infrastructure integration that collect data from core services running on your hosts, such as MySQL, Apache, or Redis, among others.

There are multiple ways of installing on-host integrations depending on your setup and needs. Here we present a brief overview of all install methods and when it's more appropriate to use them.

## What do you need? [#what-need]

To collect data from on-host services, all you need are two things: the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent), and the [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations). All on-host integrations require that our infrastructure agent is [installed on the host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent). Besides collecting system's data, the agent acts as a forwarder for integrations's data, and can forward [logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).

![Agents and New Relic](./images/Agents-and-NR-%288%29.png "Agents and New Relic")

The infrastructure agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services, and is able to [forward logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent) to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate [APM agents](/docs/agents). Notice how each integration and forwarder feed [different data types](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) in the New Relic database (NRDB).

## Pick your installation method [#install]

Your services may be running on a single physical host, on a VM, or in a container orchestrated by Kubernetes or ECS. Whatever the setup, our on-host integrations can adapt to your environment and send data to New Relic; all you have to do is choose the appropriate install method.

### You're running services in orchestrated environments [#orchestrated]

If you are running services in containerized, orchestrated environments, choose your scenario:

* ![Kubernetes](./images/kubernetes-logo.png "Kubernetes") [Install on-host integrations on Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes)
* ![ECS](./images/ecs.png "ECS") [Install on-host integrations on Amazon ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs) (EC2 launch type)

Our on-host integrations and the ECS and Kubernetes integration can run together; see [Intro to Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) and [Intro to ECS integration](/docs/integrations/elastic-container-service-integration/get-started/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration) to learn more.

### You're running services on-premise or on single VMs [#standard]

If you are running services without orchestration or on-premise, choose your scenario:

    title={<>Install using MSI files ( Windows Server)</>}
  >
    Integrations for services running on Windows Server can be installed using our .MSI installer or the official zip files. MSI install is recommended.

    1. Download the latest .MSI installer image [from our repository](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/).
    2. In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path.

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\TO\integration-name.msi
       ```
    3. Change `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\integration-name-config.yml.sample` to `integration-name-config.yml`, and edit according to your needs.
    4. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

    To install an Infrastructure on-host integration with `apt`:

    1. If you do not already have it, [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) for your operating system.
    2. From the command line, run:

       ```
       sudo apt-get update
       ```
    3. Run the following command, where INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME represents the integration's file name. For more information, see the [integration's documentation](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list).

       ```
       sudo apt-get install INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME
       ```
    4. Follow additional install procedures for the [specific on-host integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list).

    To install an integration package with `yum`:

    title={<>Install from tarball (Other distros)</>}

    <Callout variant="tip">
      We recommend [using your distribution package manager to install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager) and the [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic). If you choose to [manually install the agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-linux), you may also want to install the on-host integrations from the provided tarballs.
    </Callout>

    The manual install process is not automated. If you opt for manual install, you must place the different files in the correct folders, and ensure that the agent has all the permissions to execute the integrations.

    To install an integration from a tarball:

    1. Download the packaged integration file from the [tarball repository](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/linux/amd64/ "Link opens in a new window.").
    2. Unpack the tarball file according to our [integration file structure and placement rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/getting-started/integration-file-structure-activation), so the agent is able to find the definitions, configurations, and executables of the integration.
    3. Place the binary that contains the definition file inside `newrelic-integrations` or `custom-integrations` in the [agent directory](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-linux#agent-directory).
    4. Place the integration's config file under the [plugin directory](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-linux#configure-plugin).

    For integrations that require our `nrjmx` tool, follow these additional instructions:

    #### Use of the New Relic JMX tool [#nrjmx]

    Some integrations (such as [JMX](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/jmx-monitoring-integration), [Cassandra](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/cassandra-monitoring-integration), and [Kafka](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka-monitoring-integration)) require the `nrjmx` tool. If your integration needs this, download it from [our repository](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/linux/noarch/) and unpack it.

    <Callout variant="important">
      `nrjmx` requires Java 8 or higher.
    </Callout>

    For JMX integration version 2.3.3 or higher and Cassandra integration version 2.3.0 or higher, the `nrjmx` tool is included as a dependency. For this reason, when using a package manager, the `nrjmx` tool doesn't have to be installed manually.

    If you have `nrjmx` already installed and install `nri-jmx`, our JMX tool keeps the already-installed version. If you don't have `nrjmx` already installed, it gets the latest `nrjmx` release.

    By default, the `nrjmx` location is `/usr/bin/nrjmx/*`. To install in a different location, set the new path in the `NR_JMX_TOOL` environment variable.

## Update the agent [#upgrade]

To keep on-host integrations up to date, follow standard procedures to [update the on-host integration package](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package).
