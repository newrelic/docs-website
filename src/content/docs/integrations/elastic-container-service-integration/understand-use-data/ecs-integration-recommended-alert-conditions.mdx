New Relic's [ECS integration](/docs/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration) reports and displays performance data from your [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html "Link opens in a new window.") environment. This document provides some recommended alert conditions for monitoring ECS performance.

## Recommended alert conditions [#alerts]

Here are some recommended ECS alert conditions. To add these alerts, go to the [Alerts UI](http://alerts.newrelic.com/) and add the following [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) to an existing or new alert policy:

* High CPU usage

  * NRQL: FROM ContainerSample SELECT cpuUsedCoresPercent
  * Critical: > 90% for 5 minutes
* High memory usage

  * NRQL: FROM ContainerSample SELECT memoryUsageBytes / memorySizeLimitBytes
  * Critical: > 80% for 5 minutes
* Restart count

  * NRQL: FROM ContainerSample SELECT max(restartCount) - min(restartCount)
  * Critical: > 5 for 5 minutes
