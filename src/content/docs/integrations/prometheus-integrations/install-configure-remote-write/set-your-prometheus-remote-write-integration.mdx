You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. If you don't already have an account, you can [sign up for New Relic right now](https://newrelic.com/signup/).

<Callout variant="important">
  This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see the [Prometheus High Availability](/docs/prometheus-high-availability-ha) resource.
</Callout>

## Set up the integration [#setup]

From the [Prometheus remote write setup page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJwcm9tZXRoZXVzLXJlbW90ZS13cml0ZS1pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1uZXJkbGV0cy5zZXR1cC1wcm9tZXRoZXVzIn0=), complete these steps.

1. Enter a name for the Prometheus server you’re connecting to and your `remote_write` URL.

   <Callout variant="important">
     The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data, and will be the name used to identify which Prometheus server you're sending data from.
   </Callout>
2. Add a new `remote_write` URL to your Prometheus YML file. A good place to add this information is under `global_config` in the file, at the same indentation level as the `global` section. We recommend to use the following syntax:

   ```
   remote_write: 
   - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME  
     bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
   ```

   Alternatively, you could use this configuration:

   ```
   remote_write: 
   - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     If you are completing the remote write integration using Kubernetes and Helm, you should instead add the remote write URL to your Helm [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/c40486ab2eba0391119b7cc1509d6958fd21c31d/stable/prometheus/values.yaml#L631) file. Replace `remoteWrite: []` with two lines similar to the example below. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file:

     ```
     remoteWrite: 
     - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME 
       bearerToken:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
     ```
   </Callout>

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you're connecting from the EU, use the url

     `https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write.`
   </Callout>
3. Restart your Prometheus server.
4. View your data.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     You can use the remote write [dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) we automatically create when you set up your integration.

## Mapping of Prometheus metric types [#mapping]

The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include [metric type](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/metric-data-type#metric-types) information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly.

New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows:

* `metricName_bucket` is stored as a New Relic count metric type
* `metricName_count` is stored as a New Relic count metric type
* `metricName_total` is stored as a New Relic count metric type
* `metricName_sum` is stored as a New Relic summary metric type

Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type.

## Customize remote write behavior [#customize]

You may be interested in customizing the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the [docs on remote write tuning](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="x-license-key"
    title="X-License Key"
  >
    Your account's [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into.

    Details:

    * If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts you should use a different key on each remote write URL.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="prometheus_server-url-parameter"
    title={<><InlineCode>prometheus_server</InlineCode> URL parameter</>}
  >
    The `prometheus_server` parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to [NRDB](https://newrelic.com/resources/ebooks/inside-nrdb-flexible-unified-database). You should use this same label when [configuring your Grafana data source](/docs/configure-prometheus-data-source-grafana) to limit results to just those from a particular `prometheus_server`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="optimize-throughput"
    title="Optimize throughput and memory consumption"
  >
    Remote write [increases the total memory consumption](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/#memory-usage) of your Prometheus servers.

    If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following:

    * Increase [`max_samples_per_send`](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/#max_samples_per_send) for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in [`capacity`](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/#capacity).
    * If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of [`max_shards`](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/#max_shards) per server.
  </Collapser>

## Error messages

If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to get data flowing properly.

For detailed information about common errors including missing or incorrect characters, bad request errors, request entity too large errors, rate limit errors and the associated fixes, see [Remote write errors and error messages](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/remote-write-errors-error-messages).

## Remove the integration [#remove-integration]

To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file and restart the server.

<Callout variant="important">
  When you remove the integration, this stops new data from flowing, but will not purge or remove any historical data.
</Callout>
