## What is MLOps?

MLOps stands for machine-learning operations.

The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) has become the leading investment in companies across the tech industry. As more companies hop on board, the gap between data science teams developing these ML models and DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models is increasingly becoming more challenging. 

MLOps allows teams to alleviate these challenges by providing a technological backbone for managing the machine learning lifecycle through automation and scalability. This allows for a seamless collaboration between data teams and DevOp teams ultimately leading to innovative solutions through the creation of sophisctated ML models, continued development and testing, and consistent operational and monitoring of the software. 


## Integration with Algorithmia

After deploying ML models into production, tracking model performance is an underestimated challenge for ML practitioners. Without rigorous observability capabilities, organizations risk failure to react to changes in the model input or output, or the model’s ability to capture the relation between these two.  

Since New Relic’s cloud-based observability infrastructure already helps instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your entire software stack, Algorithmia is the perfect solution to collect model performance data and connect with New Relic’s monitoring tools - allowing for a smooth integration for business and operational management. 

By sending your model performance metrics from Algorithmia Insights to New Relic and having real-time monitoring for your algorithms, you can explore your Metrics data with user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your algorithms for faster and more efficient troubleshooting.

## How to integrate Algorithmia with New Relic?

Your algorithm’s metrics are streamed using Algorithmia Insights to a Kafka topic. You have another algorithm - the New Relic connector - that can transform and send any Insights payload to New Relic Metrics for the configured account. Using Algorithmia’s Event Flows your New Relic connector algorithm is configured to get called when a new message is sent to your Kafka topic collecting Insights. With this event flow, when your Insights enabled algorithms are run, the New Relic connector algorithm gets called with your algorithms’ Insights payload. The connector algorithm then transforms your Insights metrics and sends them to your New Relic account.

Use the following instructions to set up this integration:

Step 1: Get your API key
After logging in to your New Relic account, go to your profile from the account drop down menu on the right hand corner and select API keys. Create a key with “User” as the “key type” and note it down for later reference for your Algorithmia side configuration.

Step 2: Create a dashboard
From your New Relic One main page, go to your main Dashboards page. From here you can either create a dashboard from scratch or start with Algorithmia’s default metrics dashboard. To get started with the Algorithmia template, click on the “Import dashboard” button from the menu icons on the right. On the pop up page, paste the following JSON Text:
```
{
  "name": "Algorithmia Dashboard for Default Metrics",
  "description": null,
  "permissions": "PUBLIC_READ_WRITE",
  "pages": [
    {
      "name": "Algorithmia Dashboard for Default Metrics",
      "description": null,
      "widgets": [
        {
          "visualization": {
            "id": "viz.line"
          },
          "layout": {
            "column": 1,
            "row": 1,
            "height": 3,
            "width": 4
          },
          "title": "Runtime Duration by Algorithm",
          "rawConfiguration": {
            "legend": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "nrqlQueries": [
              {
                "accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID,
                "query": "SELECT average(algorithmia.duration_milliseconds) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET `algorithm_name` LIMIT 10 SINCE 1800 seconds ago"
              }
            ],
            "yAxisLeft": {
              "zero": true
            }
          },
          "linkedEntityGuids": null
        },
        {
          "visualization": {
            "id": "viz.line"
          },
          "layout": {
            "column": 5,
            "row": 1,
            "height": 3,
            "width": 4
          },
          "title": "Throughput by Algorithm",
          "rawConfiguration": {
            "legend": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "nrqlQueries": [
              {
                "accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID,
                "query": "SELECT count(algorithmia.duration_milliseconds) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET `algorithm_name` LIMIT 10 SINCE 1800 seconds ago"
              }
            ],
            "yAxisLeft": {
              "zero": true
            }
          },
          "linkedEntityGuids": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Remember to update the fields that say "accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" with your own New Relic Account ID. Click on “Import dashboard” and get ready to observe your Algorithmia Insights metrics on these widgets.

Step 3: Configure Algorithmia Insights
To start using Insights, your Algorithmia Platform Administrator connects your cluster to a Kafka broker / cluster to which metrics will be sent. Once this one time administrator setup is done, you can start using Algorithmia Insights in an algorithm. Detailed instructions on how to configure these are in Algorithmia’s Insights documentation page.

Step 4: Create the New Relic connector algorithm
Create a new algorithm on Python 3.8 environment with the following source code and dependencies:
__Algorithm source code__
```
import Algorithmia
import json
from datetime import datetime
from newrelic_telemetry_sdk import GaugeMetric, MetricClient

client = Algorithmia.client()
metric_client = MetricClient(os.environ["newrelic_api_key"])


def convert_str_timestamp_to_epoch(str_time):
    obj_time = datetime.strptime(str_time, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")
    return int(obj_time.timestamp() * 1000)

def get_operational_metrics(payload):
    ALGORITHM_TAGS = {
    "algorithm_version",
    "request_id",
    "time",
    "algorithm_name",
    "session_id",
    "algorithm_owner"
    }
    inference_metrics = {
        key: payload[key] for key in payload.keys() ^ ALGORITHM_TAGS
    }
    return inference_metrics

def send_to_newrelic(inference_metrics, insights_payload):
    newrelic_metrics = []
    for key, value in inference_metrics.items():
        name = "algorithmia." + key
        epoch_time = convert_str_timestamp_to_epoch(insights_payload["time"])
        tags = {
            "algorithm_name": insights_payload["algorithm_name"],
            "algorithm_version": insights_payload["algorithm_version"],
            "algorithm_owner": insights_payload["algorithm_owner"],
            "request_id": insights_payload["request_id"],
            "session_id": insights_payload["session_id"],
        }

        newrelic_metrics.append(GaugeMetric(
            name=name, value=value, tags=tags, end_time_ms=epoch_time
        ))

    response = metric_client.send_batch(newrelic_metrics)
    response.raise_for_status()


def apply(input):
    insights_payload = input
    inference_metrics = get_operational_metrics(insights_payload)
    send_to_newrelic(inference_metrics, insights_payload)
    return None
```
__Algorithm Dependencies (requirements.txt)__
```
algorithmia>=1.0.0,<2.0
newrelic_telemetry_sdk==0.4.2
```
If you’re using the Web IDE to create these, click on Save and Build and compile your algorithm. If you’re developing your algorithm locally, push your algorithm repository as you’d normally do to build an algorithm version. Once your build finishes, you can test it with this sample payload and make sure it runs successfully. This test input is how your Insights payload will look like. 
```
{
  "risk_score": 0.2,
  "duration_milliseconds": 8,
  "algorithm_version": "1.0.6",
  "session_id": "rses-f28bb94a-5556-4aeb-a6d2-89493626bf4f",
  "time": "2021-02-20T00:21:54.867231",
  "algorithm_name": "credit_card_approval",
  "request_id": "req-9f5345b4-a1cd-431c-a43a-bd2a06f4a6f4",
  "algorithm_owner": "asli"
}
```

Step 5: Configure with API key
Use the New Relic API Key from Algorithmia Secret Store

Step 6: Setup Algorithmia Event Flows with New Relic 
Once your New Relic connector algorithm is published, configure it to get triggered whenever a Kafka topic receives a message. This Kafka topic will be the same as your Algorithmia Insights Kafka topic. This way, when an algorithm that has Insights enabled gets called and emits its metrics, the metrics payload will be used to call your New Relic connector algorithm. Detailed instructions on how to configure this event based flow are in the Algorithmia Event Flows documentation. 


For any published algorithm on your cluster that has Insights enabled, once the algorithm's API endpoint is called, your New Relic connector algorithm will in turn be called through the Algorithmia Event Flows trigger. The connector algorithm will then push your Insights metrics to your New Relic Account.

As you call your Insights enabled algorithms, you can then verify that your metrics appear in New Relic as ```algorithmia.<METRIC-NAME>```, and your data points are plotted on your New Relic dashboard’s charts.



## Integrate your ML solution with New Relic MLOps

Step 1: Create an API key
After logging in to your New Relic account, go to your profile from the account drop down menu on the right hand corner and select API keys. Create a key with “User” as the “key type” and note it down for later reference for your Algorithmia side configuration.

Step 2: Create a dashboard
From your New Relic One main page, go to your main Dashboards page. From here you can either create a dashboard from scratch or start with Algorithmia’s default metrics dashboard. To get started with the Algorithmia template, click on the “Import dashboard” button from the menu icons on the right. On the pop up page, paste the following JSON Text:
```

          "layout": {
            "column": 1,
            "row": 1,
            "height": 3,
            "width": 4
          },
          "title": "Runtime Duration by Algorithm",
          "rawConfiguration": {
            "legend": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "nrqlQueries": [
              {
                "accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID,
                "query": "SELECT average(algorithmia.duration_milliseconds) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET `algorithm_name` LIMIT 10 SINCE 1800 seconds ago"
              }
            ],
            "yAxisLeft": {
              "zero": true
            }
          },
          "linkedEntityGuids": null
        },
        {
          "visualization": {
            "id": "viz.line"
          },
          "layout": {
            "column": 5,
            "row": 1,
            "height": 3,
            "width": 4
          },
          "title": "Throughput by Algorithm",
          "rawConfiguration": {
            "legend": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            "nrqlQueries": [
              {
                "accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID,
                "query": "SELECT count(algorithmia.duration_milliseconds) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET `algorithm_name` LIMIT 10 SINCE 1800 seconds ago"
              }
            ],
            "yAxisLeft": {
              "zero": true
            }
          },
          "linkedEntityGuids": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Remember to update the fields that say "accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" with your own New Relic Account ID. Click on “Import dashboard” and get ready to observe your Algorithmia Insights metrics on these widgets.

Step 3: Setup your policies and conditions
The various metrics being tracked are a great way to use New Relic Applied Intelligence to create policies. A policy is a group of one or more conditions. To add an Alert, simply click on the 3 dots next to the metric you want to turn into an Alert and select “create alert condition”. Next, enter the condition name and double-check the populated signal. Finish creating your condition by adding the threshold and selecting the threshold type. For further information on adding a policy, view this document. For more information on setting the condition, view this document.

Step 4: Get notified through your preferred platform(s)
After creating your policy, you can set up a notification channel to receive alerts when the threshold is exceeded. To do so, simply click Notification Channel on the right hand tab above the policy or on the left side navigation menu. Detailed instructions on setting up your notification channel can be found here

Step 5: Correlate your incidents
Finally, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. Correlation occurs between two events whenever the criteria in any decision is met. New Relic also gives you the opportunity to train the module and create a custom decision yourself. To dig into the details, view individual incidents under the Incidents tab in New Relic Applied Intelligence and click on any incidents you believe should be correlated. Once finding the incidents you’d like to correlate, use the correlation assistant to create decisions by using your expertise in your data and systems. Further instructions on correlating incidents can be found here.
