The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the [Kubernetes cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer) in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) platform, or use the infrastructure [events UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

## Requirements

The Kubernetes events integration requires:

* New Relic [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration) installed and activated.
* Kubernetes pod with the label `app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events` and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic.

## Install the Kubernetes events integration [#install]

To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment:

1. Download the integration manifest YAML file:

   ```
   curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml
   ```
2. Edit the `nri-kube-events-latest.yaml` manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key) (required).

   ```
   clusterName: "YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME"
   [...]
   	- name: "NRIA_LICENSE_KEY"
   	value: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
   ```
3. Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml
   ```
4. To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Query builder**, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

   ```
   FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago
   ```

## View your Kubernetes events [#use-data]

Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic.

To add events to your [New Relic One dashboard](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards):

1. Add a chart to a [new or existing dashboard](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/building-insights-dashboards) or create a chart using the New Relic [chart builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
2. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type **table** and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster:

   ```
   FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT
   event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message 
   WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100
   ```

## Query events [#data-insights]

Here are a few examples to [query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data):

### Get attributes names [#attributes-names]

To see all the attributes names, use the following query:

```
FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes'
```

### See event details [#event-details]

To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster:

```
FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, 
event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE 
category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​
```

The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the [Kubernetes documentation's event v1 core reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#event-v1-core).

### Search events in New Relic [#data-infrastructure]

To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI:

1. [Navigate to the Infrastructure event page](http://one.newrelic.com): Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure** **> Events**.
2. In **Category**, select **kubernetes**.
3. Use the <Icon name="fe-search"/>
   **Search events** field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the [filter set](/docs/scopes-organize-your-infrastructure).

### View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer [#data-cluster]

To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods:

* **In New Relic One**: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Kubernetes cluster explorer**.

Then, to view the pod details:

1. In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod.
2. Select **Show pod events**.

## Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector [#events-mentrics]

To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started:

1. Install the New Relic [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/prometheus-kubernetes/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-kubernetes).
2. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is `prometheus.io/scrape=true`).

## Optional: Define custom attributes [#custom-attributes]

To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature `NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue`. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the `kube-events` container.

For example, to add the attribute `environment` with value `staging` to all the events, you need to add the following to your manifest:

```
env: 
  - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment 
    value: dev
```

Remember that the environment should be specified in the spec for the `kube-events` container, making your manifest look something like:

```
...
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kube-events
          ...
          env:
            - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment
              value: dev
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration.

    To check the logs of our event collector:

    ```
    kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events
    ```

    To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding `verbose: "true"` in the `config` section of you configuration file, either before or after the `clusterName`.

    To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic:

    ```
