## Problem

You have completed the [installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for New Relic's Kubernetes integration but are not seeing Kubernetes data in your New Relic account.

## Solution

<Callout variant="important">
  Effective Wednesday, 12 August 2020, Kubernetes integration v1.7 or lower will be deprecated. To avoid losing data, [upgrade to the latest version](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#update). For more information, read our [New Relic Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-end-of-life-kubernetes-integrations-v1-7-or-older/102167) or contact your New Relic account team.
</Callout>

If you have [deployed the infrastructure agent](#install) and completed the [Kubernetes installation procedure](/docs/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) but are not seeing any information in the Kubernetes dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Check if you've access to this feature. See [Factors affecting access to features and data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
2. Confirm you have configured the `CLUSTER_NAME` and `NRI_LICENSE_KEY` variables in the deployment file before running it. See the [installation procedures](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) for more information.
3. Confirm the deployment was successful by running:

   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep newrelic
   ```
4. [Retrieve the logs from the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/get-logs-version) and ensure there are no [error messages](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/troubleshooting/kubernetes-integration-troubleshooting-error-messages).
