metaDescription: How to install the K8 integration using Helm. Alternative method to New Relic's default install for infrastructure monitoring.
---

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes.

To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Kubernetes installation with Helm. To install the integration using manifests, see [Kubernetes integration: install and configure](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration).

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

Our Helm chart is compatible with both Helm 2 and 3. Make sure [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) is installed on your machine.

To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name:

1. Find and copy your [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).
2. Find the name of your cluster with this command:

```
kubectl config current-context
```

## Install Kubernetes integration with Helm [#install-k8-helm]

    New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform:

    - [`newrelic-infrastructure`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-infrastructure):
    Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic
    Kubernetes experience.
    - [`newrelic-logging`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging): Provides a
    DaemonSet with New Relic's [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) output
    [plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to easily forward your logs to
    [Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs).
    - [`nri-kube-events`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-kube-events): Collects and
    reports cluster events (such as `kubectl get events`) to New Relic.
    - [`nri-metadata-injection`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-metadata-injection):
    Automatically injects metadata in applications deployed to the cluster to correlate APM monitoring with
    Infrastructure monitoring.
    - [`nri-prometheus`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-prometheus): New Relic's
    Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, allows to scrape Prometheus endpoints and [report metrics to New
    Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic#OpenMetrics).
    - [`nri-statsd`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-statsd): New Relic StatsD
    integration.

    Additionally, New Relic provides
    [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle), a chart which pulls a
    selectable set of the charts mentioned above. `nri-bundle` can also install Kube State Metrics for you if needed.

    We recommend using the [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart
    for Kubernetes deployments, as it provides the easiest way to select, install, and upgrade individual components at
    your will.

    ### Installing and configuring `nri-bundle` with Helm

    1. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent:

    ```
    kubectl config set-cluster <var>DESIRED_CLUSTER</var>
    ```

    To see the available clusters, run `kubectl config get-clusters`.

    2. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo:

    ```
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

    3. Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the
    `--dry-run` and `--debug` switches and therefore the agent isn't installed.

    ```
    helm upgrade --install <var>newrelic</var> newrelic/nri-bundle \
    --dry-run \
    --debug \
    --set global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var> \
    --set global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var> \
    --set infrastructure.enabled=true \
    --set prometheus.enabled=true \
    --set webhook.enabled=true \
    --set ksm.enabled=<var>false</var> \
    --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \
    --set logging.enabled=true
    ```

    You can flip the `ksm.enabled` flag to `true` if KSM isn't already present in your cluster.

    4. Install the Kubernetes integration:

    ```
    helm upgrade --install <var>newrelic</var> newrelic/nri-bundle \
    --set global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var> \
    --set global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var> \
    --set infrastructure.enabled=true \
    --set prometheus.enabled=true \
    --set webhook.enabled=true \
    --set ksm.enabled=<var>false</var> \
    --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \
    --set logging.enabled=true
    ```

    5. Wait a few seconds, then check that the `DaemonSet` and pods have been created:

    ```
    kubectl get daemonsets,pods
    ```

    6. Make sure you see a `DaemonSet`, and one pod per node for `newrelic-infrastructure`, as well as one `Deployment`
    and one pod for any other component that you have enabled.

    ### Configuring `nri-bundle` with Helm

    #### Enabling and disabling subcharts

    The `nri-bundle` chart pulls the following dependencies, if the corresponding flags are enabled:

    | Subchart | Flag |
    |----------|------|
    | `newrelic-infrastructure` | `infrastructure.enabled` |
    | `nri-prometheus` | `prometheus.enabled` |
    | `nri-metadata-injection` | `webhook.enabled` |
    | `kube-state-metrics` | `ksm.enabled` |
    | `nri-kube-events` | `kubeEvents.enabled` |
    | `newrelic-logging` | `logging.enabled` |

    #### Configuring subcharts

    The `nri-bundle` chart leverages [Helm's subchart configuration
    mechanism](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals) to configure its components. This means
    that you can supply the configuration values to the individual components of the chart, as listed at the beginning
    of this section, by prefixing them with the name of the chart.

    For example, to run the agent in
    unprivileged mode, you can add `--set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false` to the command above, where
    `newrelic-infrastructure` is the name of the sub-chart (as listed at the beginning of the section), and `privileged`
    is the configuration value for said chart.

    Please refer to [each of the chart's README](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/) and their
    `values.yml` to see all available configuration options and their defaults.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section
      are provided for legacy purposes only.
    </Callout>

    To install using Helm 2:

    1. Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured.
    Please check the [official documentation](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/) for more details.

    2. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent:

    ```
    kubectl config set-cluster <var>DESIRED_CLUSTER</var>
    ```

    To see the available clusters, run `kubectl config get-clusters`

    3. Make sure that `kube-state-metrics` is installed on your machine:

    ```
    kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics
    ```

    If it's not installed, follow the [instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub
    repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#kubernetes-deployment) to install it.

    4. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo:

    ```
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
    ```

    5. Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the
    `--dry-run` and `--debug` switches and therefore the agent is not installed.

    ```
    helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \
    --dry-run \
    --debug \
    --set licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var> \
    --set cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var> \
    --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>
    ```

    6. Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration:

    ```
    helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \
    --set licenseKey=<var>your_new_relic_license_key</var> \
    --set cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var> \
    --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>
    ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Note that the `--dry-run` and `--debug` switches have been removed.
    </Callout>

    7. Wait a few seconds, then check that the `DaemonSet` and pods have been created:

    ```
    kubectl get daemonsets,pods
    ```

    8. Make sure you see a `DaemonSet`, and one pod per node.

    ### Helm configuration options [#config-options]

    When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your
    configuration variables with the `--set` flag.

    ```
    helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \
    --set licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var> \
    --set cluster=<var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME</var>
    ```

    A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the [`newrelic-infrastructure` chart
    README](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-infrastructure)
