[Kamon](https://kamon.io/) provides an instrumentation toolkit that specializes in automatic instrumentation of Scala and Akka applications. It consists of APIs for metric and tracing instrumentation and automatic instrumentation modules that create application metrics and distributed traces. Kamon also provides reporter modules to transfer telemetry data to a backend of your choice.

New Relic's Kamon reporter is included in the Kamon Bundle, and you can configure it to send telemetry data from your Kamon-instrumented applications to your New Relic account.

Resources for our Kamon reporter:

* [Integration specs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-exporter-specs/tree/master/kamon)

## Find your data

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Your applications** > **Entity explorer**. From the **Entities** screen, search for your service by name. New Relic provides an out-of-the-box overview that includes charts for some of the most useful metrics provided by Kamon instrumentation. If you're also sending distributed tracing data, the Distributed tracing feature is available to query and view traces.

You can use the out-of-the-box overview as a starting point to build your own dashboards. Click on the `...` icon in a chart to add that chart to a dashboard or view the query behind the chart to modify it and it add it to your dashboard.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).
