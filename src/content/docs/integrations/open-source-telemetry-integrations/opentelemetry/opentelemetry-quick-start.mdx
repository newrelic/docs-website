OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step.

1. [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
2. [Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry](#instrument)
3. [Export your telemetry data to New Relic](#export)
4. [View your data in the New Relic UI](#view-data)

## Step 1. Prerequisites [#prereqs]

First things first:

* If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free [New Relic account](/https://newrelic.com/signup).
* Copy your [account license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).

## Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry [#instrument]

To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually.

Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete [Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic](#export).

* [Erlang](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang)
* [Go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java)

* [.NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet)

* [Swift](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift)
* [...See a complete list of languages in GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry)

## Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic [#export]

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md), or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. 

<Callout variant="important">
Our support of OTLP ingest is currently in pre-release. To particiapte in the pre-release program, please complete this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform), and we'll send you details.
</Callout>

In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic:

<Callout variant="tip"> 
If you prefer to export your data to an OpenTelemetry collector, see our [instructions](#collector) below.
</Callout>

To complete this step, you'll follow the OTLP exporter documenentation for your language. Before you go to this external documentation, keep in mind you'll need to configure the OTLP exporter to send data to New Relic. This includes setting the header and configuring the endpoint:

* Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( ```api-key``` ) whose value is your [Account License Key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).
* Configure the endpoint for the exporter to point to New Relic. You'll receive the endpoint URL when you sign up for the [pre-release program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform). 

Now, follow the instructions for your language:

<Callout variant="important"> 
Make sure you are following the instructions for the OTLP gRPC exporter for your language. New Relic doesn't currently support OTLP HTTP exporters.

    title="Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) "
  >
The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent:

* **Gateway:** The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. 
* **Agent:** The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it.

When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. The difference in this case is that instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export it to a collector that you set up. Then, in the collector, you configure the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter) to export data to New Relic.

When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this:

![Diagram showing OpenTelemetry using the OpenTelemetry Collector and New Relic's OTLP endpoint.](./images/native_otlp_with_collector.svg "Diagram of OTLP with collector")

Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML:

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

```
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
    headers:
      api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```
2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the endpoint you received when signing up for the [pre-release](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform) and replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your [Account License Key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher):

```
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

docker run --rm \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
  -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
  --config otel-config.yaml \
  --name otelcol \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector
```

The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see [View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-opentelemetry-data-new-relic).
