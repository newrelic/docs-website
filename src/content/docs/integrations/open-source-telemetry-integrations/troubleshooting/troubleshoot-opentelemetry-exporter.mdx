[OpenTelemetry](http://opentelemetry.io) is an emerging standard for service-level instrumentation. Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change.

If you're using [New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter), but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help.

OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to [find your data](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-opentelemetry-data-new-relic).

## Install

To send your data through the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector), configure your OpenTelemetry SDK `service.name` as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the [New Relic exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter) with your Insert API key. Consult the [collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/about/) if you're having trouble sending data through the collector.

Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the [explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts). Select your service to view its summary page.

## Traces

When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select **Distributed tracing** to see [distributed traces](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-trace-ui). If you don’t see traces:

* Ensure your service was reporting during the time window.
* Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans.
* If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using.

Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces.

### Trace sampling [#sampling]

Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data.

You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic [sampling](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling).

Note that New Relic may [rate-limit trace data](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-general-requirements-limits#requirements).

## Metrics [#h2_list_example]

When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select **Metrics explorer** to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about.

<Callout variant="caution">
  The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months.
</Callout>

## Errors

When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select **Errors** to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute `error.stack`. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes:

* error.stack
* error.msg
* error.type

In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with `error.`

<Callout variant="caution">
  The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.
</Callout>
