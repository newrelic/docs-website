New Relic offers an integration for reporting your AWS X-Ray data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate the integration [#activate-integration]

To enable the AWS X-Ray integration, follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure).

When you've successfully connected your AWS account with New Relic:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure**, and then click **AWS**.
2. Click **Manage Services** to select the AWS integration you want to activate.
3. Check the checkbox next to **AWS X-Ray**.
4. Click **Save**.

## Configuration and polling

You can change the polling frequency and filter your data using [configuration options](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Here's the default [polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/polling-intervals-aws-integrations) information for the AWS X-Ray integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

<Callout variant="tip">
  Please allow up to 20 minutes for traces to appear.
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-data]

New Relic maps X-Ray segments into span events. Once you've activated this integration, you should see AWS X-Ray traces appearing in [distributed tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data).

To filter your spans, you can use the `newRelic.ingestPoint` attribute. This attribute is set to `xray.polling` for all X-Ray spans.

## Using custom IAM policies

If you're using a custom IAM policy when connecting your AWS account with New Relic Infrastructure, your custom policy will need the following permissions for the AWS X-Ray integration to work:

* `xray:BatchGet*`
* `xray:Get*`
