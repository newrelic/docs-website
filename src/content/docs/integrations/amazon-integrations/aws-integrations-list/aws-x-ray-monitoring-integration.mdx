New Relic offers an integration for reporting your AWS X-Ray data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate the integration [#activate-integration]

To enable the AWS X-Ray integration, follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure).

When you've successfully connected your AWS account with New Relic:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure**, and then click **AWS**.
2. Click **Manage Services** to select the AWS integration you want to activate.
3. Check the checkbox next to **AWS X-Ray**.
4. Click **Save**.

## Configuration and polling

You can change the polling frequency and filter your data using [configuration options](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Here's the default [polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/polling-intervals-aws-integrations) information for the AWS X-Ray integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

<Callout variant="tip">
  Please allow up to 20 minutes for your first traces to appear. Since traces are collected after they complete, and
  only once per polling interval, the X-Ray trace data lags real-time considerably, and should not be used for alerting.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important">
  Polling intervals longer than 5 minutes may result in lost traces. New Relic drops trace data more than 20 minutes
  old. Similarly, long-running traces are likely to be incomplete. New Relic's X-Ray Monitoring will collect
  completed traces only, and spans within a trace older than 20 minutes are dropped.
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-data]

New Relic maps X-Ray segments into span events. Once you've activated this integration, you should see AWS X-Ray traces appearing in [distributed tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data).

To filter your spans, you can use the `newRelic.ingestPoint` attribute. This attribute is set to `xray.polling` for all X-Ray spans.

## Using custom IAM policies

If you're using a custom IAM policy when connecting your AWS account with New Relic Infrastructure, your custom policy will need the following permissions for the AWS X-Ray integration to work:

* `xray:BatchGet*`
* `xray:Get*`

## X-Ray and Lambda Functions [#lambda]

Lambda functions require some configuration to use X-Ray. See the
[Using AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html) section in the AWS Lambda Developer
Guide.

In particular, note that the execution role for your Lambda function will need
[additional permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html#services-xray-permissions) to
record data to X-Ray.

## X-Ray and Step Functions

AWS Step Function state machines are distributed applications, and can be monitored with X-Ray. X-Ray tracing needs to
be [explicitly enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-xray-tracing.html) for X-Ray to
capture data for step function state machines.

Be sure to enable X-Ray tracing for any [lambda functions](#lambda) in your state machine as well as for the
state machine overall.
