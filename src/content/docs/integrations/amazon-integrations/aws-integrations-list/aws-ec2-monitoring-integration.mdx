[New Relic Infrastructure's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integration for reporting your EC2 metadata to New Relic products. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features [#about]

[Amazon's EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a central part of Amazon's cloud-computing platform. All New Relic Infrastructure users, regardless of [subscription level](https://newrelic.com/infrastructure/pricing), can use the New Relic Infrastructure agent to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status. New Relic's EC2 integration uses the [`ec2Describe*` policy](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) to add data about your EC2 instances to your standard Infrastructure data. Infrastructure also imports [Amazon EC2 custom tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) and adds it to your data.

You can also create [custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#attributes) to be analyzed in New Relic.

## Activate EC2 integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

<Callout variant="important">
  You must install the Infrastructure agent on each EC2 host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your EC2 account allows Infrastructure to access EC2 metadata, such as region, type, and tags.
</Callout>

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon EC2 integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: [1 minute or 5 minutes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ebs-metricscollected.html), depending on CloudWatch plan

## Use data in Infrastructure [#view-ec2]

This table describes the locations in New Relic Infrastructure where you can find and use your EC2 data:

Infrastructure also imports your [Amazon EC2 custom tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html), typically prefaced by `label.<tag_key>`.

For more on how to find and use integration data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## View and use data [#insights-ec2]

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ComputeSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `Ec2Instance`.

The EC2 integration collects the following subset of instance metrics from AWS CloudWatch.

<table style={{ fontSize: "12pt" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "230px" }}>
        Name

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCheckFailedInstance`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed the instance status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCheckFailedSystem`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed the system status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCheckFailed`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
