[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS Health data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

This integration collects information from [AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html) about events that can affect the AWS resources and services globally or in a specific account. This data can help you anticipate potential application outages.

AWS Health reports three types of events:

* **Open issues**: Shows issues that might affect your AWS infrastructure.
* **Scheduled changes**: Informs you in advance of scheduled activities that might have an impact on AWS services and resources.
* **Notifications**: Provides additional information.

## Requirements

This integration is available only for AWS customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan, because this is a requirement for using the AWS Health API.

## Activate integration [#requirements]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Health integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

## Explore integration data [#find-use]

This integration does not fetch metrics, only [inventory information](#metrics). To use this integration's data:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select any of the available AWS Health integration links.
3. To view a complete list of open issues, select the [**Inventory** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure).
4. To view a timeline when an AWS Health inventory event is created, modified, or deleted, use the [**Events** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

## Inventory data [#metrics]

[Inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) provides information about active AWS Health events. New Relic's AWS Health integration generates three types of entities, each of which have the same inventory data:

* `aws/health/issue/`
* `aws/health/scheduled-change/`
* `aws/health/notification/`
