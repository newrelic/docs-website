CodeStream's <DoNotTranslate>**Activity Feed**</DoNotTranslate> allows you to participate in ongoing discussions, and the <DoNotTranslate>**Filter & Search**</DoNotTranslate> page allows you to access any discussion, including older ones.

## Activity feed [#activityfeed]

The activity feed is the definitive place to find out about new comments and issues posted by your teammates or new replies to existing discussions. When you're not on the activity feed, you can always tell whether or not there's anything new by looking for a badge on the activity feed icon. A blue badge with a white dot means that there are new discussions or replies.

  alt="This image shows an badge on the activity feed icon."
  src={codestreamActivityFeedBadge}
/>

CodeStream's entry in your IDE's status bar also lets you know when there are new messages in the feed. A dot to the right of your username means there are new messages and a number means there are new mentions.

/>

The filter at the top of the activity feed controls what you see in the feed.

* <DoNotTranslate>**Activity from everyone in my organization**</DoNotTranslate>: See all of the activity from your organization. We only recommend this for small organizations.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Activity associated with code open in my IDE (default)**</DoNotTranslate>: See discussions related to code in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Activity associated with code in selected folder**</DoNotTranslate>: Use this option if your team is working within monorepos. See discussions related to code in the currently selected folder.

Regardless of your filter settings, you'll always be notified when you're @mentioned.

## Filter and search [#filtersearch]

The filter and search tools allow you to slice and dice your organization's collection of comments and issues however you see fit. By default, you'll get a view of any open issues assigned to you, followed by all open issues.

Use [advanced search syntax](#advanced-search) to create your own searches. You can save them for future use via the bookmark icon at the right side of the search box, or click on the <DoNotTranslate>**Filter**</DoNotTranslate> button to leverage predefined filters.
