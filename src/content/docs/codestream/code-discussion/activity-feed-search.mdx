    The activity feed is the definitive place to find out about new comments and issues posted by your teammates or new replies to existing discussions. When you're not on the activity feed, you can always tell whether or not there's anything new by looking for a badge on the activity feed icon. A blue badge with a white dot means that there are new discussions or replies.

    <img
      title="badge"
      alt="This image shows an activity badge on an icon."
      src={codestreamActivityFeedBadgeIcon}
    />

    CodeStream's entry in your IDE's status bar also let's you know when there are new messages in the feed. A dot to the right of your username means there are new messages and a number means there are new mentions.

    <img
      title="ide-status"
      alt="This image shows how CodeStream appears in your IDE's status bar"
      src={codestreamStatusBarMentions}
    />

    The filter at the top of the activity feed controls what you see in the feed.

    * **Activity from everyone in my organization**: See all of the  activity from your organization. We only recommend this for small organizations.
    * **Activity associated with code open in my IDE (default)**: See discussions related to code in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
    * **Activity associated with code in selected folder**: Use this option if your team is working within monorepos. See discussions related to code in the currently selected folder.

      Regardless of your filter settings, you'll always be notified when you're @mentioned.

    Our filter and search tools enable you to slice and dice your organization's collection of comments and issues however you see fit. By default, you'll get a view of any open issues assigned to you, followed by all open issues.

    <img

      alt="A screenshot showing the filter and search tool."
      src={codestreamFilterandSearchBar}
    />

    Use the filter and search tool to pick through your codestream organization and find a specific comment or issue:

    * Hover over any item in the list to get more details.
    * Benefit from our powerful predefined filters to make things easy.
    * Use our advanced search syntax to create your own searches and you can save them for future use via the bookmark icon at the right side of the search box.
