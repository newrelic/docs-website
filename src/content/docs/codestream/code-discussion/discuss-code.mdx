Getting developers to talk about code earlier and more frequently in the development process leads to great outcomes for your team. Conversation brings better performing and higher quality code, and happier developers. New Relic CodeStream makes it easier than ever to discuss code. 

Whether it's a question, a suggestion, documentation or a bug report, select some code, click <DoNotTranslate>**Add comment**</DoNotTranslate> or <DoNotTranslate>**Create issue**</DoNotTranslate>, and optionally share out to Slack or Teams. All of these discussions are saved and anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago. Whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way.

Even as a file changes over time, the comments remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the comment move along with your changes.

## Creating a comment or an issue [#create]

Select a block of code in your editor and then click on either the <DoNotTranslate>**Add comment**</DoNotTranslate> or <DoNotTranslate>**Create issue**</DoNotTranslate> icons in the CodeStream pane next to your selection.

If you're using a JetBrains IDE such as IntelliJ, click on the <DoNotTranslate>**+**</DoNotTranslate> button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code.

Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can discuss code via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. You can also look for the <DoNotTranslate>**+**</DoNotTranslate> menu at the top of the CodeStream pane.

## Sharing to Slack or Microsoft Teams [#sharing]

CodeStream has both a [Slack integration](/docs/codestream/code-discussion/slack-integration) and a [Microsoft Teams integration](/docs/codestream/code-discussion/msteams-integration) that make it easy to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE, or aren’t yet on CodeStream. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack.

## Creating issues [#issues]

In addition to sharing to Slack and Teams, CodeStream also integrates with a number of issue-tracking services. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), GitHub (cloud or on-prem), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Shortcut, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the form when creating an issue.

  alt="A screenshot showing the issue tracking services that can be selected."

/>

After going through the authentication process with the selected service, you can select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project.

/>

Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it includes a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example, you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira.

<img
  title="An issue connected to the code."
  alt="A screenshot showing an issue connected to the code."
  src={codestreamIssueExample}
/>

The issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE.

/>

## Bring the right people into the discussion [#mentions]

When you create a comment or issue, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched the code you're commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate.

  title="auto-mention"
  alt="A screenshot showing the auto-mention feature."

## Work with different versions of the code [#code-versions]

Maybe you're on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven't pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you're looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at. As a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a discussion doesn't match what you have locally.

CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block, the current version, and a diff.

  title="version diff"
  alt="A screenshot showing a code diff."
  src={codestreamCodemarkWithCodeDiff}
/>

Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it's code that you just typed into your editor and haven't yet committed. CodeStream empowers you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process.
