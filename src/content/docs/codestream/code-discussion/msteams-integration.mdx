When you post a comment or issue your teammates will get notified via the activity feed, and potentially via email. Sometimes, though, you might want to share to Microsoft Teams as well. This would allow you to reach people who haven’t yet joined CodeStream, or maybe don’t spend a lot of time in their IDE.

## Connect to Microsoft Teams [#connect]

1. Go to the **Integrations** page under the username menu in CodeStream and click on the **Microsoft Teams** button.
2. Copy the sign-in code displayed and then click on the **Connect to Teams** button.

   src={codestreamMsteamsConnect}
/>

3. You'll be taken to Teams where you should see the following popup for the CodeStream app. Click the **Add** button. Note, do not expand it and select the options to add to team or chat. Simply click Add.

   src={codestreamMsteamsCodestreamAppPage}
/>

4. This will take you to your private chat with the CodeStream bot, and you’ll see the CodeStream logo appear in the Teams sidebar. Click the **Sign In** button in the bot's welcome message, or type `signin` in this chat and submit.

/>

5. Paste your sign-in token into the popup and then click on the **Sign-in** button.

/>

6. Go to a channel in which you’d like to share, type `@`, and then select **Get bots** in the popup.

   src={codestreamMsteamsAddBotButton}
/>

7. Select the CodeStream bot from the list (you can search for it if you need to), and then click **Add**.
8. Return to the channel and @mention the CodeStream bot with the `connect` command. Repeat this in any channel that you'd like to share to.

   alt="An image showing the command to connect a bot." 
   src={codestreamMsteamsCodestreamConnectBotMessage}
/>

9. Once you get a confirmation, you’re ready to share to Teams from CodeStream.
10. When you return to CodeStream you'll now be able to share to the channels that you just connected.

## Participate in CodeStream from Microsoft Teams [#participate]

When you share to Microsoft Teams, not only does it notify your teammates about the codemark, but they can use it to jump directly into their IDEs to participate in the conversation on CodeStream.

### Open in IDE [#open-ide]

Click **Open in IDE** to view both the code and the discussion right inside your IDE. You’re taken through a CodeStream web page where you can choose which IDE to open. CodeStream remembers your selection the next time you view a discussion from the same repository. You’re then taken to the appropriate source file in your IDE, scrolled to the relevant block of code, with the discussion displayed in the CodeStream pane. If you don’t happen to have that repository open in your IDE, CodeStream will automatically open the source file for you (assuming you’ve opened that repository previously, with CodeStream installed, so that we know where to find it).

If you’re using a JetBrains IDE, install the [Toolbox app](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) so that CodeStream can deep link into the IDE.

### Open on GitHub (or Bitbucket or GitLab) [#open-github]

If the code block is from a repository hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, this button will take you to the corresponding block of code on that hosting service.
