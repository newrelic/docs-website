CodeStream account settings let you make changes to your personal account.

## Account settings [#account-settings]

The <DNT>**Account**</DNT> menu is located under the username menu at the top of the CodeStream pane, and you'll find options for viewing your profile and changing your CodeStream username. Note that if you have a profile photo associated with your New Relic email address on Gravatar it will automatically be used in CodeStream.
