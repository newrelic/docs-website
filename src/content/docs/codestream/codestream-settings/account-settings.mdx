CodeStream account settings let you make changes to your personal account.

## Account settings [#account-settings]

The **Account** menu is located under the username menu at the top of the CodeStream pane, and you'll find options for viewing your profile and changing your CodeStream username. Note that if you have a profile photo associated with your New Relic email address on Gravatar it will automatically be used in CodeStream.

## Notifications [#notifications]

By default, you're set to automatically follow any comment or issue that you created, where you’ve been mentioned (either in the original post or in a subsequent reply), or to which you’ve replied. You can always choose to follow or unfollow any individual comment or issue via its ellipses menu.

You can choose whether you want to be notified via email, desktop, or both. Email notifications are sent immediately, and you can participate in the discussion by replying to the email. Your reply will get added to CodeStream as a reply to the appropriate comment or issue. Be sure that when you reply you're doing so from the same email address where the notification was sent (that is, your email address as shown on your **Profile** on CodeStream).

Desktop notifications in the IDE are only available if you’re using VS Code or a JetBrains IDE.

### Additional notifications [#additionalnotifications]

CodeStream also offers the following notifications.

* **Send me weekly emails summarizing my activity**: Sent every Monday with information about you and your organization's activity for the previous week.
* **Notify me about performance issues**: New methods in the code that are performing poorly will trigger a toast notification in your IDE, based on code-level metrics [anomaly detection](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring/#anomalies). Note that if you have multiple repositories open in your IDE and/or multiple services associated with those repositories, you'll only get notified about the first method with anomalous performance. Be sure to check the **Code-Level Metrics** section for the complete list.

## Blame map [#blame]

Click **Blame Map** under the username menu to add email addresses that you use for committing code that may be different from the email address you used to sign up for New Relic. For example, your New Relic email address might be [dave@acme.com](mailto:dave@acme.com), but you might also commit code as `dave@webmail.com`.

Click **Add mapping**, enter your Git email address, and then select your entry from the list of organization members. That way, when someone comments on code committed by [dave@webmail.com](mailto:dave@webmail.com), CodeStream will know to at-mention `dave@acme.com`.

While non-admins can only create blame maps for themselves, admins can create blame maps for any member of the organization. This is useful for reassigning code ownership when people leave the organization.
