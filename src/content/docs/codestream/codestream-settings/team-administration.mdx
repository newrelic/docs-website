metaDescription: "How to manage your CodeStream organization."

New Relic CodeStream provides several tools for managing the teammates in your organization, whether they have accounts with New Relic One or not.

## Manage people and roles [#manage]

Click [My Organization](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/my-organization) menu at the top of the CodeStream pane to invite people to your organization and assign or remove admin privileges.

## Use blame map to reassign code [#blame-map]

Click **Blame Map** to define code ownership with your organization.

By default, when you comment on code, CodeStream mentions (or offers to email) the author or authors of the code you're commenting on. If that person has left the company it might not be the right thing to do. 

Non-admins are able to set up blame maps for themselves to handle situations where the email address they use to commit code is different than the one they used to sign up for CodeStream.

## Organization settings [#organization-settings]

If you're an organization admin, look for the **Organization Admin** menu under the headshot menu at the top of the CodeStream pane.

## Onboarding settings [#onboarding]

Domain-based joining allows anyone with email addresses on the specified domains to join your CodeStream organization without being first invited. Not only does this make it very easy to get your teammates on board, but it ensures that they'll be part of your organization (as opposed to accidentally creating their own).


## Feedback request assignment and approval [#feedback-requests]

Admins can control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for your organization.

By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the organization.

* **Any reviewer can approve**: Anyone can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers are assigned.
* **All reviewers must approve individually**: Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved.

You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. **Round-robin** will cycle through all developers in the organization. **Random** will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The **Authorship** options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch.

## Change your organization's name [#change-name]

Update the name of your CodeStream organization at any time.

## Export your data [#export] 

There's a lightweight export tool for getting your organization's discussions out of CodeStream.
