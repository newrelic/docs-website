title: Why aren't PRs/issues from all GitHub organizations listed?
metaDescription: "How to make sure all of your GitHub organizations are listed in CodeStream."
---

When you connect to GitHub you should see all of your open pull requests in the
Pull Requests section of the CodeStream pane, as well as all issues assigned to
you in the Issues section. If pull requests or issues from any of your GitHub
organizations are missing, it's probably because at the time you authenticated
with GitHub, you didn't grant access to all of your organizations.

If you didn't click on that Grant button at authentication time, simply go to
GitHub and navigate to Settings > Applications and click on the Authorized OAuth
Apps tab. From there, click on the CodeStream application. On the following
page, click the Grant button next to any organizations that you'd like to be
able to access from CodeStream. Note that in some instances you'll see a Request
button instead of Grant, which means that the owner of your GitHub organization
will need to grant access.
