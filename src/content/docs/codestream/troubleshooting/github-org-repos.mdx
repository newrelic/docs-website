title: Why aren't PRs and issues from all of my GitHub organizations listed in CodeStream?
metaDescription: "How to make sure all of your GitHub organizations are listed in CodeStream."

When you connect to GitHub you should see all of your open pull requests in the
**Pull Requests** section of the CodeStream pane, as well as all issues assigned to
you in the **Issues** section. If pull requests or issues from any of your GitHub
organizations are missing, it's probably because at the time you authenticated
with GitHub and you didn't grant access to all of your organizations.

If you didn't click the **Grant** button at authentication time, on
GitHub go to **Settings > Applications** and click the **Authorized OAuth
Apps** tab. From there, click the CodeStream application. On the following
page, click the **Grant** button next to any organizations that you'd like to be
able to access from CodeStream. 

In some instances, you'll see a **Request**
button instead of **Grant**, which means that the owner of your GitHub organization
will need to grant you access.
