If you add `/api/v4/version` to the end of the URL for your GitLab Self-Managed instance the resulting page will show you your version information.

For example, our URL is `http://gitlab.codestream.us/api/v4/version`, which results in:

```
version:	"13.6.4"
revision:  "2754dab2b1b"
```

If you'd like to use CodeStream's integration with merge requests from GitLab Self-managed, you'll need version 12.10 or later.
