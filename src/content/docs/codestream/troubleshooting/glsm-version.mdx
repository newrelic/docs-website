title: Determine the version of your GitLab self-managed instance for CodeStream
metaDescription: "How to find the version of your GitLab self-managed instance."
---

If you add `/api/v4/version` to the end of the URL for your GitLab self-managed
instance the resulting page will show you your version information. For example,
our URL is `http://gitlab.codestream.us/api/v4/version`, which results in:

`version:	"13.6.4"`

`revision:  "2754dab2b1b"`

If you would like to use CodeStream's integration with merge requests from
GitLab self-managed, you'll need version 12.10 or later.
