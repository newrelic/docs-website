<Callout variant="caution">
  Recent versions of Jira Server (8.14.0 or higher) support the use of API Tokens to access the Jira Server REST API. We recommend you use API Tokens if possible to avoid the more complicated setup described here. [Check your Jira Server version](jira-server-version/).

  You must be a Jira administrator in order to configure this integration. To determine if you have the proper permissions in order to proceed, look for the Jira settings menu (cog icon, most likely at the top-right, next to your profile and settings menu icon) and make sure there's an **Applications** option there. If you don't have the **Settings** menu, or the **Applications** option, then you won't be able to configure the integration.

  This integration requires that your Jira Server instance be at a publicly accessible URL.

New Relic CodeStream can integrate with Jira Server using Atlassianâ€™s published REST API. To enable CodeStream to integrate with your Jira Server installation, set up a CodeStream application link. This application link serves as a conduit for users to authenticate against their Jira Server account without ever having to enter their credentials in CodeStream.

Jira Server uses the OAuth standard (version 1.0a) for client authorization. For reference, [See Atlassian's documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/).

However, you don't need to follow the full instructions on that page. The relevant instructions are duplicated and simplified here for clarity.

You'll need the `openssl` command-line tool to generate a public/private key pair for use with the application link.

## Generate a public/private key pair [#generate-key]

In a terminal, use `openssl` to generate your public/private key pair, using these steps:

1. Generate a 1024-bit private key:

   ```
   openssl genrsa -out jira_privatekey.pem 1024
   ```

2. Create an X509 certificate:

   ```
   openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -key jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_publickey.cer -days 365
   ```

   Enter whatever information you see fit to accompany the certificate.

3. Extract the private key (PKCS8 format) to the `jira_privatekey.pcks8` file:

   ```
   openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_privatekey.pcks8
   ```

4. Extract the public key from the certificate to the `jira_publickey.pem` file:

   ```
   openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in jira_publickey.cer > jira_publickey.pem
   ```

## Create an application link [#create-application-link]

Follow these steps to create your application link within Jira Server.

1. In Jira, navigate to **Jira settings** (gear icon in upper-right), click **Applications**. Enter your administrator password, if needed. Then select **Application links** under **Integrations**, in the left sidebar.

2. Where it says **Enter the URL of the application you want to link**, enter any URL you want, for example, `http://example.com/`. Then click **Create new link**.

3. You will likely see a warning starting with: **No response was received from the URL you entered**. You can ignore the warning; click **Continue**.

4. Fill out the form as you see here, or as you like. None of the data entered here really matters, except to make sure that **Create incoming link** is checked. The **Application Name** can be whatever name works best for you to identify the link. Then click **Continue**.

   <img
     alt="Create Jira Server Application Link"
     src={codestreamCreateJiraServerAppLink}
   />

5. On the next dialog, enter any unique string you want for the **Consumer Key**. It does not need to be secure or encoded, just something fairly easy to remember. Make a note of what you enter here; it will be needed when you go to set up the integration with Jira Server from CodeStream. For **Consumer Name**, you can enter anything meaningful to you, like "CodeStream app". The important field to fill out correctly is **Public Key**. Copy the full text of the contents of the **jira_publickey.pem** file you created in Step #1. Paste this into the **Public Key** field, then click **Continue**.

<img
  alt="Jira Server Link Applications"
  src={codestreamJiraServerAppLinkOauth}
/>

The application link you created should now show like this:

<img
  alt="Jira Server Application Link Created"
  src={codestreamJiraServerAppLinkCreated}
/>

## Set up the integration in CodeStream [#jira-integration]

Now you're ready to set up the integration from CodeStream to Jira Server for your team, using the application link you created. Assuming you have signed up for CodeStream and have the extension open in your IDE:

1. In CodeStream, go to the **Integrations** panel by clicking the menu next to your username in the top-left. Then click **Jira Server** under **Issue Providers**.

2. Since you won't be using API Tokens with your Jira Server integration, click at the top where it says **Click here if your organization uses a version of Jira Server older than...** to configure Jira Server using the OAuth method described herein.

3. Fill out the form:
   * For **Jira Server Base URL**, enter the URL used to access your Jira Server installation as known to your internal network, in the form http(s)://host:port.
   * For **Consumer Key**, use the consumer key you entered when created the application link, from Step #2, above. Then copy the full contents of the private key, in PCKS8 format, that you created in Step #1 above. The file should be called **jira_privatekey.pcks8**. Paste those contents into the **Private Key** field, then click **Submit**.
     <img alt="Configure Jira Server" src={codestreamConfigureJiraServer}/>

4. You'll then be taken to your Jira Server instance, where you'll approve access to your account using the application link. When you are finished, return to your IDE and you should see something similar to this:
   <img alt="Completed Jira Server Integration" src={codestreamJiraServerIntegrationComplete}/>

5. Now that the integration has been set up for your organization, other users will NOT have to go through the process described above. Other users in your organization will see the integration with your Jira Server (specified by host) alongside other available integrations. Initiating this integration will only require your other users to allow the CodeStream application link to access their account, as you did in the final step.
