We know that your source code is one of your most valuable and sensitive assets. For most development teams, it's a literal representation of your most important work product.

CodeStream needs to store snippets of code in our database when you discuss a block of code through a comment or issue. CodeStream saves that block of code in the database for a variety of reasons. For example, if the code in question hasn't been pushed, then storing it is the only way to share it with your teammates.
