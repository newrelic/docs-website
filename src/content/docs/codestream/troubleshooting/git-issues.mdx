When you post a message with a code block you may encounter one of the following
Git-related warnings.

## Repo isn’t managed by Git or Git can't be found [#not-found]

While technically not a requirement, key elements of Code Stream’s functionality depend on your repository being managed by Git or a Git-hosting service like GitHub. If you’re not using Git, CodeStream won't be able to connect the comments and issues you create to the appropriate blocks of code in your source files.

This error could also mean that Git isn’t in your PATH. If so, please add it to your PATH and then restart your IDE.

## Repo doesn’t have a remote URL [#no-remote-url]

The remote URL is part of what allows CodeStream to tie the code block from your message to the appropriate file and location in the corresponding repo in your IDE. If CodeStream isn't able to identify the repository your teammate has open as the same one in which you created your comment or issue, they won't be able to see the comment or issue.

From the command line, use `git remote -v` to confirm whether or not you have a remote URL configured for your repository. If there's no remote URL, find out the correct URL and then specify the remote URL via `git remote add origin <remote URL>`.

## Unsaved file [#unsaved]

As with files not managed by Git, CodeStream won't be able to link a comment or issue to a block of code in a new, unsaved file. Go ahead and save the file before creating your first comment or issue.
