import jiraServerVersion from 'images/JiraServerVersion.png'

Most pages on Jira Server show the version number in the footer of the page. Here's an example.

<img
  alt="Jira Server Version"
  src={jiraServerVersion}
/>

Most pages should have this information in the footer. For example the default system dashboard, but you can also try checking the **About Jira** page under the **Help** menu.
