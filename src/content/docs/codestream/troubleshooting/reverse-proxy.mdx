When creating GitLab issues from CodeStream you may get a `404 Not Found` error. GitLab group / project URLs are
generated with an encoded forward slash which isn't handled by the default apache2 reverse proxy. In order to allow
apache2 to successfully resolve these URLs add the following to your apache2 config:

* Add the AllowEncodedSlashes
* Add `nocanon` to the end of your ProxyPass line

For example:

```
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
ProxyPass / http://33.211.55.3:9000/ nocanon
```
