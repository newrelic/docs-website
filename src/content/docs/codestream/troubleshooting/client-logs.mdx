When reporting issues to New Relic customer support it is often helpful to include log files. Follow these instructions for your IDE to get your log files.

## JetBrains [#jetbrains]

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. In your IDE go to <DoNotTranslate>**Help > Collect Logs and Diagnostic Data**</DoNotTranslate>. This will open the finder where you should see a newly created zip file.

## VS Code [#vscode]

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. Open the <DoNotTranslate>**Output**</DoNotTranslate> view in VS Code (<DoNotTranslate>**View: Toggle Output**</DoNotTranslate> from the command palette) and select <DoNotTranslate>**CodeStream (Agent)**</DoNotTranslate> from the dropdown menu at the top-right.
   Copy all of the output you see and save it in a text file.

## Visual Studio [#visual-studio]

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**Tools > Options > CodeStream**</DoNotTranslate> and make sure your log level is set to at least `Debug`. If it is set to `Info`, `Errors`, or `Silent`, change it to `Debug`, then restart Visual Studio.
2. Reproduce the issue.
3. Grab `vs-extension.log` and `vs-agent.log` from `%localappdata%\CodeStream\Logs` as well as the `ActivityLog.xml` from `%AppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\16.0_<RandomText>` (for Visual Studio 2019) or `%AppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\17.0_<RandomText>` (for Visual Studio 2022).
