As part of submitting a bug report on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/CodeStream/issues) it would be very helpful if you'd also include your log files. Follow these instructions for your IDE to get your log files. You can attach the log files to the GitHub issue or, if youâ€™d prefer, you can email them to [codestream@newrelic.com](mailto:codestream@newrelic.com) and reference the GitHub issue number in the subject.

## JetBrains [#jetbrains]

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. In your IDE go to **Help > Collect Logs and Diagnostic Data**. This will open the finder where you should see a newly created zip file.

## VS Code [#vscode]

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. Open the **Output** view in VS Code (**View: Toggle Output** from the command palette) and select **CodeStream (Agent)** from the dropdown menu at the top-right.
   Copy all of the output you see and save it in a text file.

## Visual Studio [#visual-studio]

1. Go to **Tools > Options > CodeStream** and make sure your log level is set to at least `Debug`. If it is set to `Info`, `Errors`, or `Silent`, change it to `Debug`, then restart Visual Studio.
2. Reproduce the issue.
3. Grab `vs-extension.log` and `vs-agent.log` from `%localappdata%\CodeStream\Logs` as well as the `ActivityLog.xml` from `%AppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\16.0_<RandomText>` (for Visual Studio 2019) or `%AppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\17.0_<RandomText>` (for Visual Studio 2022).
