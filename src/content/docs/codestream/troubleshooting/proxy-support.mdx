title: CodeStream proxy support
metaDescription: "Troubleshoot a common CodeStream connectivity issue."
---

If you are experiencing connectivity issues with the CodeStream extension it
could be because you’re behind a network proxy and CodeStream is not configured
to work with it. To find CodeStream’s settings in your IDE:

* VS Code - Go to Settings/Preferences and search for “CodeStream”.
* Visual Studio - Go to Tools > Options > CodeStream.
* JetBrains - Go to Settings/Preferences > Tools > CodeStream.

Look for the “Proxy Support” setting and make sure it is set to “on”. You will
also need to disable Strict SSL checking since your CodeStream extension won’t
see the SSL/TLS certificates as coming from a legitimate Certificate Authority. 

Here's what these settings look like in VS Code.

If you have proxy support configured in your IDE, CodeStream will first try to
inherit those settings. Otherwise, CodeStream will inherit proxy settings from
your operating system/environment.

After changing your settings, restart your IDE.
