Nobody likes to break the build, but if you do, best to find out right away, right in your IDE! 

## Connect your CI/CD tool [#connect-cicd]

CodeStream currently integrates with CircleCI, with support for additional CI/CD tools on the way. Click the **Connect** button and then enter your CircleCI API token.

## See your build status [#build-status]

CodeStream shows you the five most recent builds for each of your workflows based on your current repository and branch.

Each build can be expanded to see all of its jobs, and you can easily click through to CircleCI to get artifacts and build logs.
