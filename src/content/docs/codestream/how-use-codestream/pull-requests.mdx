For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request and CodeStream allows you to keep that workflow inside your IDE. The **Pull Requests** section of the CodeStream pane lists all open pull requests that are relevant to you.

<Callout variant="important">
  The pull request integration is available for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, and Bitbucket Server. Note that pull request review is not, however, available for Bitbucket Server.
</Callout>

  The pull request section seperates PRs by those waiting for review, those assigned to you, those created by you, and the most recent PRs.
</figcaption>

Click on any pull request in the list to edit, review or even merge the code. You’ll see the pull request get expanded in a tree view that provides access to the pull request’s details, as well as all of the files that were changed. The things that you do most frequently… adding and viewing comments… are easily accessible. Just click on any file to open the diff and start reviewing the changes.

<img
  title="Pull request diff"
  alt="A screenshot showing a diff in a pull request"
  src={codestreamPullRequestDiffView}
/>

You can use your IDE’s built-in diff navigation to move between the changes in a file. Select a block of code to add a comment. Note that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that aren't part of the changeset. These comments are added as a single comment ("comment now" in GitLab's vernacular) to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress.

In VS Code, you’ll see a comment button appear over in the CodeStream pane.

<img
  title="Commenting in a pull request in VS Code"
  alt="A screenshot showing how to comment in a PR in VS Code"

In a JetBrains IDE you’ll see a comment button appear in the diff gutter, and clicking it will allow you to comment right in the editor.

<img
  title="Commenting in a pull request in JetBrains"
  alt="A screenshot showing how to comment in a PR in JetBrains"
  src={codestreamPrCommentJetbrains}
/>

As you add comments they’ll appear nested under the appropriate file in the tree view, making it easy for you, and the pull request’s author, to get at them.

<img
  title="Comments in a pull request"
  alt="A screenshot showing comments in a pull request"
  src={codestreamPrComments}
/>

Clicking on a comment will open the discussion and scroll you to the corresponding block of code in the diff. 

<img
  title="Pull request conversation view"
  alt="A screenshot showing conversation view in a pull request"
  src={codestreamPrConversationView}
/>

Need to make a requested change? Just click “Open Local File” to go straight to where you need to do your work. Or click “Show Comment in Diff” just to its left to jump to the location for any other comments in the current file.

As you work your way through the files in the pull request, click the circle to mark a file as viewed. And when you're done, click the green Review button to submit the review.

<img
  title="Viewed state for a file in a pull request"
  alt="A screenshot showing the viewed state for a file in a pull request"
  src={codestreamPrMarkasViewed}
/>

Click the PR Details entry in the tree to manage the pull request. Change the pull request's reviewers, assignees, and labels, or add comments to the pull request that aren't code comments.

### Managing the list of pull requests [#manage-prlist]

By default, you'll see your pull requests broken out into the following sections, which are really just default queries:

* **Waiting on My Review**: Open pull requests where you are a reviewer, or a requested reviewer.
* **Assigned to Me**: Open pull requests assigned to you.
* **Created by Me**: Open pull requests created by you.
* **Recent**: The five most recent pull requests created by you, regardless of status.

When you hover over a pull request's row you'll see options to view the pull request on your code-hosting service, copy the pull request's URL, checkout the branch, and refresh the pull request to make sure what you're looking at is up to date.

Hover over any section's heading for options to refresh the list pull requests in that section, edit the section's query, or to delete the section.

<img
  title="header-icons"
  alt="A screenshot showing the header icons"
  src={codestreamPrAssignedtoMe}
/>

If you want to view, or review, a pull request that isn't in your list just grab the URL and then click on the **Load PR from URL** section.Paste in the URL and you can view the pull request right inside CodeStream.

<img
  title="open-pr-url"
  alt="A screenshot showing how to open a PR through a url"
  src={codestreamLoadPrFromUrl}
/>

When you hover over the Pull Requests section heading, icons appear at the right.

<img
  title="pull-requests-section-heading-icons"
  alt="A screenshot showing the pull request section heading icons"
  src={codestreamPrSectionHeaderButtons}
/>

Options include:

* Refresh all the sections (or queries) at once.
* Create a new pull request.
* Create a new section based on a custom query. Note that there are some special guidelines when creating a custom query for [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](#github), or [GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed](#gitlab). Custom queries are not available for Bitbucket.
* Click on the gear icon for more options, including the ability to see pull requests from all repositories, and not just those associated with repositories open in your IDE, and the ability to include labels in the list. If your GitLab organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, there's also an option to enable this.

## Create a pull request [#create]

To open a pull request at any time, click the **+** button at the top of the CodeStream pane or the **+** button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (`ctlr+shift+/` `p`, `ctrl+/` `p` on a Mac, and `m` if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream  provides you with tree view, list view, and diff view options for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request.

<img
  title="Open a pull request"
  alt="A screenshot showing how to open a pull request"
  src={codestreamOpenNewPrRequest}
/>

With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request; CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request, review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form.

If the feature branch you're working on doesn't have a remote-tracking branch, when you create a pull request, you can set your remote-tracking branch.

See also the following options to create pull requests:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="pr-forks"
    title="Create a PR across forks"
  >
    CodeStream automatically detects when you're working on a fork and allows you to set both the base and head repositories.

    <img
      title="Compare across forks"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to compare across forks"
      src={codestreamOpenPrRequestFork}
    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="pr-feedback"
    title="Create a PR from a feedback request"
  >
    You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you'll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request, make sure you've committed and pushed any changes included in your feedback request.

    <img
      title="feedback request"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to create a PR from a feedback request"
      src={codestreamOpenPrFeatureRequest}
    />

    When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connects the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request in the feedback request.

    <img
      title="link to pull request"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to link to a PR from a feedback request"
      src={codestreamFeatureRequestLinktoPr}
    />

    Add a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### GitHub custom queries [#github]

By default, GitHub's search API does a global search across all of GitHub. As a result, you'll need to make sure that your query includes at least one of the following qualifiers to make sure that the result set is appropriately limited.

* `user:USERNAME`
* `org:ORGNAME`
* `repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
* `author:USERNAME`
* `assignee:USERNAME`
* `mentions:USERNAME`
* `team:ORGNAME/TEAMNAME`
* `commenter:USERNAME`
* `involves:USERNAME`
* `reviewed-by:USERNAME`
* `review-requested:USERNAME`
* `team-review-requested:TEAMNAME`
* `project:PROJECT_BOARD`

More details about GitHub's search syntax can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

### GitLab custom queries [#gitlab]

All searches are done using `attribute=value` format with an `&` between each parameter. For parameters with a space in them, leave them as-is and do not put quotes in the parameter (for example, `labels=foo,help wanted`). You can use `@me` to specify your user id and user name otherwise they can be found on GitLab. All filters, by default, have parameter `scope=all` (see [Minimum Qualifiers](#minimum-qualifiers)). To overwrite this, use `scope=X`. See the examples given below.

    To search in a specific project use parameter `project_id=X`. Project IDs are listed when viewing the project on GitLab. Searching through a project, by default, uses `scope=all` and will return all merge requests or issues for the project specified. Only one `project_id` may be listed at a time.

    ```
    project_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
    iids[]=1&project_id=473&labels=bug
    ```
  </Collapser>

    To search in a specific group use parameter `group_id=X`. Group IDs are listed when viewing the group on GitLab. Searching through a group, by default, uses `scope=all` and will return all merge request or issues for the group specified. Only one `group_id` may be listed at a time.

    ```
    group_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
    iids[]=1&group_id=473&labels=bug

    By default, custom filters use `scope=all` which searches across all of GitLab. To avoid pulling all merge requests or issues listed on GitLab, you will need to refine this search using at least one of the following qualifiers:

    * `scope=assigned\_to\_me`
    * `scope=created\_by\_me`
    * `project_id`
    * `group_id`
    * `author_id`
    * `author_username`
    * `assignee_id`
    * `assignee_username`
    * `my\_reaction\_emoji`
  </Collapser>

Search syntax is derived from GitLab's custom search API. Refer to GitLab's documentation for more details on [merge request searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html) or [issue searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html).
