New Relic CodeStream allows developers to see how the code they're responsible for is performing in production by bringing observability into the IDE and making it part of their daily routine. 

## Connect CodeStream and New Relic [#connect]

In order to access observability in your IDE you'll need to connect CodeStream to New Relic via your [New Relic user
key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) (learn more about [New Relic user
keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key)).

  src={observabilitySectionConnect1}
/>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

Once you have your user key, click **Connect to New Relic** in the **Observability** section of CodeStream, then paste your user key and click **Connect to New Relic**. If you signed up for CodeStream using your New Relic user key then you'll already be connected.

Note that you must have a New Relic user type of [core user or full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#user-type-capabilities) in order to use the observability features in CodeStream.

## Associate repositories with New Relic entities [#repo-association]

The telemetry data available in CodeStream is contextual, meaning that it's all related to the code you have open in your IDE. In order to do this CodeStream needs to know what entities on New Relic are built by the repositories you have open, and there are a number of ways to make these associations.

There are instances where CodeStream will prompt you to make an association if one doesn't exist. For example, if you try to view an error from New Relic in CodeStream, and the entity the error belongs to isn't associated with a repository, CodeStream will ask you to identify the appropriate repository. The Observability section of the the CodeStream pane will also prompt you to make an association for the currently selected repository in your IDE.

<img
  title="Associate repositories in your IDE with entities."
  alt="A screenshot of associating repositories in your IDE with entities."
  src={associateRepos}
/>

Making these associations on the fly when prompted is a great way to get started, however we recommend one of the following methods since they require less ongoing manual effort and eliminate the possibility of end-user mistakes, such as misconfigured remote URLs. These methods have the additional benefit of allowing you to associate a repository with multiple entities. For example you might have different entities that represent different environments (e.g., production, staging) and they may all be associated with the same repository.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="env-var"
    title="Use environment variable with APM (recommended)"
  >
    Set the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL`. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it with your application entity automatically.

    This requires the SSH or HTTPS remote URL format. We recommend that this be set as part of your build pipeline.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"

    After you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. Go to the APM Summary page via **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app)**, then look for the **Repositories** section at the bottom-right.

    <img

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nerdgraph"
    title="Use the NerdGraph API"
  >
    Use New Relic's [NerdGraph APIs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) to create a repository and associate it with your application entities.

    **Step 1: Create a repository entity**

    To create a repository entity, use the `referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository` API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters:

    * `accountId` - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to

    * `url` - example `https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`

    * `name` - example: `newrelic/beta-docs-site`

      ```
      mutation {
        referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: "[REPO_NAME]", url: "[REPO_URL]"}]) {
          created
          failures {
            guid
            message
            type
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      To find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to `referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository` gets saved as an entity tag.

      ```
      {
        actor {
          entitySearch(query: "name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'") {
            count
            query
            results {
              entities {
                guid
                name
                tags {
                  key
                  values
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }

      ```

      **Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity**

      First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to.

      Parameters:

    * `sourceEntityGuid` - the entity GUID of the application

    * `targetEntityGuid` - the entity GUID of your repository

    * `type` - always `BUILT_FROM`

      ```
      mutation {
        entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: "", targetEntityGuid: "", type: BUILT_FROM) {
          errors {
            message
            type
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this:

      ```
      {
        actor {
          entity(guid: "[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]") {
            relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) {
              results {
                target {
                  entity {
                    name
                    guid
                    type
                  }
                }
                type
              }
            }
            name
            type
            tags {
              values
              key
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      **Step 3: Cleanup (if needed)**

      Delete a repository with the following query:

      ```
      mutation DeleteRepository {
        entityDelete(guids: "[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]") {
          deletedEntities
          failures {
            message
            guid
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

With any of these methods you can specify the remote URL in either the SSH or HTTPS format:

* `git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`
* `https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git`

<Callout variant="caution">
  It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so.

  For example, `https://github.com/tuna/repo` and `git@github.com:tuna/repo` are the same repo, with different protocols.
</Callout>

## Observability in the IDE [#observability-in-IDE]

The **Observability section** of CodeStream gives developers a view into how their code is performing by allowing them to see golden metrics and errors for each service associated with the repository currently selected in the IDE. Each service has its own node in the tree, and when expanded it shows the service's golden metrics, errors assigned to you, and the five most recent errors.

If the currently selected repository isn't associated with a service on New Relic you'll be prompted to make the association, or instrument the project.

<img
  title="The observability section shows golden metrics, errors assigned to you, and recent errors."
  alt="A screenshot of the observability section showing golden metrics, errors assigned to you, and recent errors."
  src={observabilitySectionConnected1}
/>

When hovering over a service name in the tree, click on the broadcast icon to see [code-level metrics](#code-level) in the editor for that service or click on the globe to open the service's summary page on New Relic. Click on any error to view the details, inclding the stack trace, and [start collaborating](#collaborate) on resolution.

<Callout variant="tip"> 
If your project isn't monitored by New Relic, you can set up monitoring by clicking on the gear icon in the heading of the **Observability section** and then selecting **Instrument my App**. CodeStream has setup wizards available for Node JS, Java, and .NET projects. 
</Callout>

## Code-level metrics [#code-level]

Code-level metrics give you detailed insight into how your code is performing at the method level. For each method automatically instrumented by the New Relic .NET, Python and Ruby APM agents, you'll see golden signals displayed via a line of text inserted above each method called a CodeLens. Response time, throughput, and error rate are shown for the last 30 minutes.

<img
  title="A Python method with response time, throughput, and error rate metrics."
  alt="A screenshot of a Python method with response time, throughput, and error rate metrics."
  src={codeLevelMetrics}
/>

<figcaption>Code-level metrics are displayed above each instrumented method in your Python/Ruby project.</figcaption>

### Requirements [#clm-requirements]

* [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing) must be enabled.
* **.NET:** Requires .NET agent version 9.9.0 or higher. Code-level metrics must be [enabled in the .NET agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#code_level_metrics). If you're using Visual Studio, make sure that you have CodeLenses enabled in by going to **Tools > Options > Text Editor > All Languages > CodeLens** and making sure that both "Enable CodeLens" and "Show CodeStream Code-Level Metrics" are checked. If you're using VS Code, you must have the [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) extension installed.
* **Python:** Requires Python agent version 7.10.0.175 or higher. Code-level metrics are only available for projects implemented with a [supported Python framework](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages). If you're using VS Code, you must also have the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension installed with the language server enabled.
* **Ruby:** Requires Ruby agent version 8.8.0 or higher. Code-level metrics are only available for Rails applications and Ruby methods with manual traces (more [details here](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/features/ruby-codestream-integration/)). For version 8.10.0 or higher, code-level metrics are enabled by default. For versions 8.8.0 and 8.9.0, code-level metrics must be manually [enabled in the Ruby agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#code_level_metrics-enabled). If you're using VS Code, you must also have either the [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) or [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph) extension installed with the language server enabled.

Click the CodeLens to see charts visualizing each of the golden signals. If the repository is associated with multiple New Relic-monitored entities, you can easily switch between them. This will change the entity upon which the golden signals displayed in the editor are based.

<img
  title="An expanded code-level metrics CodeLens that shows related charts."
  alt="A screenshot of an expanded code-level metrics CodeLens that shows related charts."
  src={codeLevelCharts}
/>

<figcaption>Click the entity name at the top of the charts to see more detailed service-level data on New Relic.</figcaption>

### CodeLens options  [#codelens-options]

You can change how CodeLenses are displayed via the CodeStream section of your IDE's settings: 

* In VS Code, go to Settings, and search for "codestream".
* In JetBrains, go to **Preferences/Settings > Tools > CodeStream**
* In Visual Studio, go to **Tools > Options > CodeStream**

The default CodeLens format is:

```
avg duration: ${averageDuration} | throughput: ${throughput} | error rate: ${errorsPerMinute} - since ${since}
```

You can also turn CodeLenses off altogether by unchecking the **CodeStream: Show Golden Signals In Editor** setting.

## Investigating errors [#investigating-errors]

CodeStream will show you recent errors happening in the code you have open in your IDE, but you can see a more comprehensive list of APM errors via the [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/) on New Relic. When you're ready to dig into the root cause of a specific error with a stack trace, click **Open in IDE** to go directly to the code in your IDE.

<img
  title="A stack trace error in errors inbox with the &quot;Open in IDE button"
  alt="A screenshot of a stack trace error in errors inbox with the &quot;Open in IDE button.&quot;"
  src={errorsInbox}
/>

### Collaborate on resolution [#collaborate]

A typical collaboration session could include developers commenting on code in their IDEs, a DevOps engineer assigning errors in errors inbox, and a development manager following along in Slack. By meeting people in the tools they're already using, CodeStream shortens the amount of time between error
discovery and error resolution. 

Watch this short YouTube video (approx. 2:27 minutes) to see this in action.

<Video
  id="LfH7p76Cvro"
  type="youtube"
/>

Whether you clicked on an error in the **Observability section** or clicked **Open in IDE** from the errors inbox on New Relic, CodeStream presents all of the error's details, including the stack trace.

<img
  title="Someone commenting on a line of code associated with an error."
  alt="An animated image that shows someone commenting on a line of code associated with an error."
  src={observabilityVsc}
/>

<figcaption>
  Navigate the stack trace to investigate the issue.
</figcaption>

Click any frame in the stack trace to jump straight to the corresponding file and line number in your IDE. Note that frames of the stack trace that represent code that isn't part of your repository (e.g., an external library) aren't clickable.

As you navigate the stack trace, if you come across code that seems like the source of your problem, select it and click the comment icon to start a discussion. CodeStream automatically mentions the most recent person to touch that code, making it easy for you to bring the right people into the discussion.

<img
  title="A comment with the most recent code contributor automatically mentioned."
  alt="A screenshot of a comment with the most recent code contributor automatically mentioned."
  src={errorAutoMention}
/>

<figcaption>
  Select code in your editor to add a comment.
</figcaption>

* Once you've identified the problem you can assign the error, either to an existing teammate on CodeStream or to a person suggested based on the repository's Git commit history.
* You can update the error status from unresolved to resolved or ignored.
* Use the `...` **More actions** menu to share the discussion on Slack or Microsoft Teams.

### Associate build SHAs or release tags with errors [#buildsha]

When viewing and error in CodeStream you may see this warning if there's no git reference, either a build SHA or release tag, associated with the error.
CodeStream uses the git reference to match the specific stack trace error with the version of the code running in the environment that triggered the error.

While you don't need a git reference configured to investigate the error, bear in mind that you may not be looking at the version of the code that caused it.

<img
  title="The git reference not configured warning message."
  alt="A screenshot of the git reference not configured warning message."
  src={buildShaNotConfigured}
/>

<figcaption>
  The git reference not configured warning message reads: Associate a build SHA or release tag with your errors so that CodeStream can help make sure you're looking at the right version of the code.
</figcaption>

You can use an environment variable to let the New Relic APM agent know the [commit sha](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) associated with each build of your project. You can also use the [release tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) associated with the
running version of your software.

For New Relic APM, the commit sha and/or release tag (`tags.commit` and `tags.releaseTag`) are added as attributes on `Transaction` and `TransactionError` events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes.

We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline.

* `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT` - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters (e.g., `734713b`).
* `NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG` - A release tag (such as `v0.1.209` or `release-209`). This has the advantage of being human readable.

For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language:

* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration/)
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/)
* [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/)
* [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/)
* [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/)
* [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/)

If you do have git references configured, CodeStream will let you know if the version of the code you're on locally doesn't contain the reference associated with the error. In this case, you may want to check out the version of the code that does contain that reference so that you can more effectively investigate and resolve the error.

<img
  title="The git reference not found warning message."
  alt="A screenshot of the git reference not found warning message."
  src={buildShaNotFound}
/>

<figcaption>
  The git reference not found warning message reads: Your version of the code doesn't match the environment that triggered the error. Fetch the following reference to better investigate the error.
</figcaption>

CodeStream will also let you know if the error doesn't have a stack trace associated with it. This happens with older errors when the stack trace has aged out on New Relic.

## Dynamic logging with Pixie [#pixie-logging]

Dynamic logging with Pixie allows you to debug Go applications in production without the need to instrument the source code with additional log statements, recompile, and redeploy. You can dynamically capture function arguments, return values and latency right from your IDE.

<Callout variant="important">
Dynamic logging is currently only available for applications written in Go, and requires a [Kubernetes cluster monitored by Pixie](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/install-auto-telemetry-pixie/).
</Callout>

To start a logging session, right-click on any method name in your Go project and select **Dynamic Logging Using Pixie**. After selecting your New Relic account and Kubernetes information (Cluster, Namespace, Pod), you can then start a logging session ranging anywhere from one to ten minutes in duration.

<img
  title="A dynamic logging session using Pixie."
  alt="A screenshot of a dynamic logging session using Pixie."
  src={pixieDynamicLogging}
/>

You'll see values for all of the method's parameters start to be captured in real time.
