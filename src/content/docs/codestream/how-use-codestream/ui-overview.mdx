    The New Relic CodeStream sidebar surfaces all the items you need to see, and do, in a customizable tree-based view that is always available.

    />

    <figcaption>
      The main sidebar sections are: pull requests, feedback requests, codemarks, observability, and issues.
    </figcaption>

    ## Sidebar overview [#overview]

    Here's a quick overview of the sidebar sections:

    * **[Observability](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/observability-section)**: Track errors assigned to you in New Relic and discover recent errors in the repositories you have open in your IDE.

    * **[Pull requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section)**: If your team uses GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to host your code, you'll see all of your open pull requests listed here. Click a specific pull request to start reviewing or editing it.

    * **[Feedback requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/feedback-requests-section)**: If you've been assigned a feedback request or you've requested feedback from someone else, find those listed here.

    * **[Codemarks](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/codemarks-section)**: Codemarks are the discussions that annotate your codebase. Codemarks are created pull requests, feedback requests, or through ad hoc code comments/issues. All of the codemarks in your current repository are listed for reference.

    * **[Issues](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/issues-section)**: See all of your open issues, across multiple services, in one place. Click a specific issue to update its status, create a feature branch to do your work, and update your status on Slack.

    * **[CI/CD](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/cicd)**: See build status based on the current repository and branch.

      The CodeStream sidebar is completely customizable:

    * Drag and drop the sections to reorder them.

    * Click and drag a section divider to resize the sections on either side.

    * Expand or collapse each section as needed.

    * Click the maximize button in each section to fill the whole screen. This is useful when you're looking at a longer list. Click it again to return to your previous view.

      ## The username menu [#username]

      <img
        title="The username menu items."
        alt="A screenshot of the username menu items."
        src={codestreamUserMenu}
      />

      <figcaption>
        The username menu gives you options for managing your account, your organization, how you receive notifications, and what sections are visible.
      </figcaption>

      Here are descriptions of each menu item:

    * **Account**: View your profile. Includes various options for customizing the profile photo, email, username, and full name for your account.

    * **View**: Uncheck sections you're not interested in seeing.

    * **Notifications**: Manage how and what notifications you receive.

    * **Organization admin**: Manage your organization settings. Also, export your data and delete your organization.

    * **Switch organization**: Use this if you're a member of more than one organization.

    * **Integrations**: Connect CodeStream to the code host, issue, and messaging providers you use.

    * **New Relic setup**: Connect your New Relic account to CodeStream to get the most out of New Relic CodeStream's observability tools.

    * **Feedback**: Got feedback for us? Write a GitHub issue.

    * **Help**: Links to documentation, our video library, keybindings, the CodeStream workflow, what's new, and reporting an issue.

      ## Header menu items [#header-menu]

      <img
        title="The CodeStream header menu."
        alt="A screenshot of the CodeStream header menu."
        src={codestreamGlobalOptionsButtons}
      />

      <figcaption>
        The header menu items provide different options for creating and discovering content in your organization. From left to right: **Create**, **Activity feed**, **My organization**, and **Filter & search**.
      </figcaption>

    * **+** (Compose): Click to create a code comment/issue, request feedback on changes, or to create a pull request.

    * **[Activity feed](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/activity-feed)**: The activity feed will let you know about new code comments/issues and feedback requests, as well as replies to existing ones.

    * **[My organization](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/myorganization)**: See who is in your CodeStream organization, invite new members, and create blame maps.

    * **[Filter & search](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/filter-and-search)**: The filter a search tools enable you to slice and dice your team’s collection of code comments, issues, and feature requests however you see fit.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="ui-activity"
    title="Activity feed"
  >
    The activity feed is the definitive place to find out about new comments, issues, and feedback requests posted by your teammates or new replies to existing discussions. When you're not on the activity feed, you can always tell whether or not there's anything new by looking for a badge on the activity feed icon. A
    blue badge with a white dot means that there are new discussions or replies.

    <img
      title="badge"
      alt="This image shows an activity badge on an icon."
      src={codestreamActivityFeedBadgeIcon}
    />

    <figcaption>
      A blue badge with a number inside means that there are new discussions or replies where you've been mentioned.
    </figcaption>

    CodeStream's section in your IDE's status bar also let's you know when there are new messages in the feed. A dot to the right of your username means there are new messages and a number means there are new mentions.

    <img
      title="ide-status"
      alt="This image shows how CodeStream appears in your IDE's status bar"
      src={codestreamStatusBarMentions}
    />

    The filter at the top of the activity feed controls what you see in the feed.

    * **Activity from everyone in my organization**: See all of the  activity from your organization. We only recommend this for small organizations.
    * **Activity associated with code open in my IDE (default)**: See discussions related to code in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
    * **Activity associated with code in selected folder**: Use this option if your team is working within monorepos. See discussions related to code in the currently selected folder.

      Regardless of your filter settings, you'll always be notified when you're @mentioned.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="filter-search"
    title="Filter and search tool"
  >
    Our filter and search tools enable you to slice and dice your organization's collection of comments, issues, and feedback requests however you see fit. By default, you'll get a view of any open issues or feedback requests assigned to you, followed by all open issues and feedback requests.

    <img
      title="filter"
      alt="A screenshot showing the filter and search tool."
      src={codestreamFilterandSearchBar}
    />

    Use the filter and search tool to pick through your codestream organization and find a specific comment, issue, or feedback request:

    * Hover over any item in the list to get more details.
    * Benefit from our powerful predefined filters to make things easy.
    * Use our advanced search syntax to create your own searches and you can save them for future use via the bookmark icon at the right side of the search box.

    It's almost inevitable that your daily routine involves working with code that someone else wrote, or that someone else modified. CodeStream displays blame information at the end of each line of code in your editor, making it easy for you to find out who last touched that code.

    <img
      title="blame-hovers"
      alt="This image shows a hover with blame information for the current line of code"
      src={codestreamBlameHoverExample}
    />

    Hover over the inline annotation to see more information about the author, the commit, and any related pull requests and feedback requests. You can also quickly initiate a discussion, or a bug report, about the given line of code.

    Note that blame information isn't displayed if you have either the GitLens or GitToolBox extensions installed. You can also turn off blame hovers in the CodeStream section of your IDE’s settings.
