No need to slow down your investigation by context switching between your IDE and your browser to search logs. CodeStream brings the New Relic log-search experience right into your IDE! Click on the **View Logs** entry for any service listed in the CodeStream pane, or click on the **View Logs** icon in CodeStream's global navigation.

CodeStream's log search is currently available for logs collected by a New Relic APM agent or the OTel integration.

Recent logs are displayed by default, and you have the ability to search by keyword, adjust the timeframe, or switch to a different service. Click on the carat to the left of any log entry to expand it and view the details. Hover over any value to easily copy it.

## Search for specific log lines [#context-menu] 

You can also jump into a log search right from any log line in your code. You can select a string to search for and the select **Find in logs** from the context menu. You can also just select **Find in logs** without first selecting any text, and CodeStream will automatically extract the string from the line where the cursor is placed.
