No need to slow down your investigation by context switching between your IDE and your browser to search logs. CodeStream brings the New Relic log-search experience right into your IDE! Click on the <DoNotTranslate>**View Logs**</DoNotTranslate> entry for any service listed in the CodeStream pane, or click on the <DoNotTranslate>**View Logs**</DoNotTranslate> icon in CodeStream's global navigation.

The dropdown list at the top of the page defaults to which ever service is currently selected in the tree view in the CodeStream pane, but you can select any service or entity to view its logs. If there are partitions associated with the selected entity you can also constrain your search to specific partitions.

Click on the carat to the left of any log entry to expand it and view the details. Hover over any value to easily copy it.

If you've narrowed down your results using a keyword search (e.g., for an error message) and now want to see a specific result in context, hover over the entry and click on the *Show Surrounding Logs* button that appears at the right. This will pin that specific result and then show the log entries that preceeded and followed it in the log file.

## Search for specific log lines [#context-menu] 

You can also jump into a log search right from any log line in your code. You can select a string to search for and the select <DoNotTranslate>**Find in logs**</DoNotTranslate> from the context menu. You can also just select <DoNotTranslate>**Find in logs**</DoNotTranslate> without first selecting any text, and CodeStream will automatically extract the string from the line where the cursor is placed.
