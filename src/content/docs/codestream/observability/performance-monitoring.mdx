New Relic CodeStream allows developers to see how the code they're responsible for is performing in production by bringing observability into the IDE and making it part of their daily routine. 

Everything in CodeStream is contextual to the repository you have open in your IDE. If CodeStream doesn't know which services on New Relic are built from this repository, you may first be prompted to associate the [repository with a service](/docs/codestream/observability/repo-association). Otherwise, you'll get a comprehensive view of how the services built from your code are performing.

For each service, the following performance data may be displayed:

* **Golden metrics:** The key signals indicating how your service is performing. The metrics vary based on the type of service.
* **Incidents:** Any open incidents based on the alert conditions configured for the service. 
* **Service-level objectives:** A summary of how the service is performing against any configured service-level objectives.
* **Code-level metrics:** See which methods in your code aren't performing well, including in-editor performance data. [Learn more about code-level metrics.](/docs/codestream/observability/code-level-metrics)
* **Errors:** Recent errors happening in the code you're responsible for. Click on an error to step through the stack trace and collaborate with teammates on the investigation. [Learn more about error investigaton.](/docs/codestream/observability/error-investigation)
* **Vulnerabilities:** Package-level vulnerabilities, including information on how to remediate.
* **Related services:** All of the services that call or are called by your service, with the ability to see the golden metrics for each of them. Understand how your service fits into the bigger picture.

When hovering over a service name in the tree, click on the globe to open the service's summary page on New Relic.

To use the observability features in CodeStream, note that you must have a New Relic user type of [core user or full platform](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#user-type-capabilities).
