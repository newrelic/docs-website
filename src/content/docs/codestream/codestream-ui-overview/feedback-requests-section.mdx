metaDescription: "The CodeStream feedback requests section list all of your open feedback requests."

New Relic CodeStream's feedback requests section lists all of the open feedback requests that have been assigned to you or that you've requested, as well as any of your recent feedback requests that have been approved or where changes have been requested.

Click a feedback request to jump in and start reviewing or to see your teammate’s comments on your work.

When you hover over the **Feedback Requests** section heading, you'll see a **+** icon to create a new feedback request. If you're an admin you'll also see a gear icon to control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for your organization.

By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can also set a default behavior for all feedback requests for your organization.

* **Any reviewer can approve**: Anyone can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers have been assigned.
* **All reviewers must approve individually**: Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved.

You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. **Round-robin** will cycle through all developers in the organization. **Random** will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The **Authorship** options suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch.
