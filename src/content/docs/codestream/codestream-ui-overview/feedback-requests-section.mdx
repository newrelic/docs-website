metaDescription: "The CodeStream feedback requests section list all of your open feedback requests."

The Feedback Requests section of the CodeStream pane lists all open [feedback
requests](../workflow/feedback-requests) that have been assigned to you or that
you have requested, as well as your recent feedback requests that have been
approved or where changes have been requested.

Click on a request to jump in and start reviewing, or to see your teammate’s
comments on your work.

When you hover over the Feedback Requests section heading, you'll see a "+" icon
to create a new feedback request. If you're an admin you'll also see a gear
icon to control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for
your organization.

By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but
you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the
organization.

* Any reviewer can approve - Any one can approve the feedback request,
  regardless of how many reviewers are assigned.
* All reviewers must approve individually - Each assigned reviewer must
  individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved.

You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. Round-robin will
cycle through all developers in the organization. Random will randomly assign
the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The Authorship
options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the
lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have
committed to the branch.
