title: CodeStream issues
metaDescription: "The CodeStream issues section shows issues assigned to you, as well as providing filtering tools."
---

If you're not already connected to an issue tracking service, initially this
section will list all available services.

* Asana
* Azure DevOps
* Bitbucket (cloud)
* Clubhouse
* GitHub (cloud or Enterprise)
* GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed)
* Jira (cloud or Server)
* Linear
* Trello
* YouTrack (cloud)

Once you’ve connected to your team’s issue tracking service, all issues assigned
to you will be listed in the Issues section of the CodeStream pane.

Note that you can be connected to multiple services at once, simply by selecting
them from the dropdown list.

![Select Providers](/images/Tasks-MultipleProviders.png)

Click on an issue to [start work](../workflow/start-work) by creating a feature
branch, updating the ticket status, and even updating your status on Slack.

When you hover over an issue's row you'll see an option to view the issue on
your issue-tracking service toward the end of the row. 

For many services you can also filter the list. For example, if you’re connected
to Trello, you can filter to see a specific list or set of lists.

For Jira, Jira Server, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed you can even create custom
filters. Note that there are some special
guidelines when creating a custom query for [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section/#github) or for [GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section/#gitlab).

![Customer Filter](/images/IssuesCustomFilter.png)

Hover over the section's heading for more options.

![Issues Header](/images/IssuesSectionHeader.png)

Click on the refresh button to update the list with any recently added tickets.

Click “New issue" (although it may be labelled differently based on the selected
service) to create a issue in your issue tracking service right from CodeStream.
You can even associate that ticket with a block of code in your editor!

If you need to work on something that doesn’t have an associated ticket, you can
click “Start ad-hoc Work” to get started without a ticket.
