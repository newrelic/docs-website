title: CodeStream permalinks
metaDescription: "CodeStream's permalinks are the mechanism used for sharing to specific comments, issues, and feedback requests to your issue-tracking service."
---

New Relic CodeStream's permalinks can be shared with anyone, whether it's via Slack, email, or whatever messaging service you use.

## Permalinks for sharing anywhere [#permalinks]

CodeStream has built-in mechanisms for sharing to Slack, Microsoft Teams, or
issue-tracking services, like Jira, Trello, etc., but you can also grab the link
for any comment, issue or feedback request to share it elsewhere. An existing
Jira ticket. A wiki. A thread in your messaging service. Whatever the case may
be, just look for the **Copy link** option under the ellipses menu.

Whenever someone clicks the link, after authenticating with CodeStream,
they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the
discussion is automatically opened. In the case of a comment or issue, the
source file opens and scrolls to the corresponding block of code.

CodeStream does its best to determine which IDE to open, largely based on the
IDE that you last used to access CodeStream. However, you can always return to
the web page that was opened and select any IDE you'd like to use. Your selection will be
remembered the next time you open a discussion associated with
the same repository.

If you’re using a JetBrains IDE, install the
[Toolbox app](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) so that CodeStream can
deep link into the IDE.

## Permalinks for code blocks [#code-blocks]

Sometimes you don’t necessarily want to comment on a block of code, but instead
just want to easily share the code with a teammate. CodeStream's permalinks are
living links that always point to the code in question, even if it's
moved to a different location in the file.

Select the code in your editor and then click the **Get Permalink** button to get a permalink for
that code.

Decide whether you want the permalink to be public or private, with private
permalinks requiring CodeStream authentication before the code can be viewed.

Copy your permalink and paste it anywhere you'd like to share the block of code.

Like with comments, issues and feedback requests, whenever someone clicks the permalink, they're automatically redirected through the web to their
IDE, where the source file will be opened and scrolled to the corresponding
block of code.
