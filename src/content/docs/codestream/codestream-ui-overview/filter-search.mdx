title: CodeStream filter and search tool
metaDescription: "The CodeStream filter and search tool helps you find specific comments, issues, and feedback requests."
---

New Relic CodeStream's filter and search tools enable you to slice and dice your organization's collection of comments, issues, and feedback requests however you see fit. By default, you’ll get a view of any open issues or feedback requests assigned to you, followed by all open issues and feedback requests.
