title: Filter and search tool
metaDescription: "The CodeStream filter and search tool helps you find specific comments, issues, and feedback requests."
---

Filter & Search allows you to slice and dice your organization's collection of
comments, issues, and feedback requests however you see fit. By default, you’ll
get a view of any open issues or feedback requests assigned to you, followed by
all open issues and feedback requests.

But you can also use advanced search syntax (see below for full list) to create
your own, and you can save them for future use by clicking the bookmark icon at
the right side of the search box.
