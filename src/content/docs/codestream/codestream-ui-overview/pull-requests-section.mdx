title: Pull requests section
metaDescription: The CodeStream pull requests section is a GitHub-specific tool for reviewing open pull requests.
---

**NOTE: The Pull Requests section currently only supports GitHub and GitHub
Enterprise. Unless you're already connected to one of those services, the
section will only appear if you have a repository from one these services open
in your IDE.**

The Pull Requests section of the CodeStream pane lists all open pull requests
that are relevant to you, and gives you the ability to control the list via
custom queries. 

![Pull Requests Section](../assets/images/PullRequestsSection.png)

By default, you'll see your pull requests broken out into the following
sections, which are really just default queries.

* Waiting on My Review - Open pull requests where you are a reviewer, or a
  requested reviewer.
* Assigned to Me - Open pull requests assigned to you.
* Created by Me - Open pull requests created by you.
* Recent - The five most recent pull requests created by you, regardless of
  status.

Click on any pull request in the list to [edit, review or even merge the
code](../workflow/pull-requests). When you hover over a pull request's row
you'll see more details, including the repo, branches and status. You'll also
see an option to view the pull request on your code-hosting service toward the
end of the row. 

Hover over any section's heading for options to refresh the list, edit the
section's query, or to delete the section.

![Query Header](../assets/images/PRQueryHeader.png)

The first section actually allows you to load any pull request via URL. Just
grab the URL of any pull request, paste it in, and you can view it right inside
CodeStream.

![Load PR from URL](../assets/images/PRLoadFromURL.png)

When you hover over the Pull Requests section heading, icons appear at the
right.

![Pull Requests Section Header](../assets/images/PRSectionHeader.png)

Options there include the ability to refresh all the sections (i.e., queries) at
once, create a new pull request, and to create a new section based on a custom
query. Note that there are some special guidelines when creating a custom query
for [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](#github-custom-queries) or for [GitLab and
GitLab Self-Managed](#gitlab-custom-queries).

![Custom Query](../assets/images/PRCustomQuery.png)

Click on the gear icon for more options, including the ability to see pull
requests from all repositories, and not just those associated with repositories
open in your IDE, and the ability to include labels in the list.

## GitHub custom queries [#github]

By default, GitHub's search API does a global search across all of
GitHub. As a result, you'll need to make sure that your query includes at least
one of the following qualifiers to make sure that the result set is
appropriately limited.

* user:USERNAME
* org:ORGNAME
* repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY
* author:USERNAME
* assignee:USERNAME
* mentions:USERNAME
* team:ORGNAME/TEAMNAME
* commenter:USERNAME
* involves:USERNAME
* reviewed-by:USERNAME
* review-requested:USERNAME
* team-review-requested:TEAMNAME
* project:PROJECT_BOARD

More details about GitHub's search syntax can be [found
here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

## GitLab custom queries [#gitlab]

All searches are done using `attribute=value` format with an `&` between each parameter. For parameters with a space in them (e.g. `labels=foo,help wanted`) leave them as is (do not put any quotes in the parameter). You can use `@me` to specify your user id and user name otherwise they can be found on GitLab. All filters, by default, have parameter `scope=all` (see [Minimum Qualifiers](#minimum)). To overwrite this, use `scope=X`. See examples given below.

### Searching By Project

To search in a specific project use parameter `project_id=X`. Project IDs are
listed when viewing the project on GitLab. Searching through a project, by
default, uses `scope=all` and will return all merge requests or issues for the
project specified. Only one project_id may be listed at a time.

```
project_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
iids[]=1&project_id=473&labels=bug
```

### Searching By Group

To search in a specific group use parameter `group_id=X`. Group IDs are listed
when viewing the group on GitLab. Searching through a group, by default, uses
`scope=all` and will return all merge request or issues for the group specified.
Only one group_id may be listed at a time.

```
group_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
iids[]=1&group_id=473&labels=bug
```

### Minimum Qualifiers [#minimum]

By default, custom filters use `scope=all` which searches across all of GitLab.
To avoid pulling all merge requests or issues listed on GitLab, you will need to
refine this search using at least one of the following qualifiers:

* scope=assigned\_to\_me
* scope=created\_by\_me
* project_id
* group_id
* author_id
* author_username
* assignee_id
* assignee_username
* my\_reaction\_emoji


Search syntax is derived from GitLab's custom search API. Refer to GitLab's
documentation for more details on [merge request
searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html) or [issue
searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html).
