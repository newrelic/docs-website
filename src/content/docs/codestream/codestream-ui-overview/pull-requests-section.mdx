title: CodeStream pull requests section
metaDescription: The CodeStream pull requests section is a GitHub-specific tool for reviewing open pull requests.
---

<Callout variant="important">
The **Pull Requests** section currently only supports GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and GitLab Self-Managed. Unless you're already connected to one of those services, the section will only appear if you have a repository from one these services open in your IDE.
</Callout>

The **Pull Requests** section of the CodeStream pane lists all open pull requests
that are relevant to you, and gives you the ability to control the list via
custom queries. 

![Pull Requests Section](/images/PullRequestsSection.png)

By default, you'll see your pull requests broken out into the following sections, which are really just default queries.

* **Waiting on My Review**: Open pull requests where you are a reviewer, or a requested reviewer.
* **Assigned to Me**: Open pull requests assigned to you.
* **Created by Me**: Open pull requests created by you.
* **Recent**: The five most recent pull requests created by you, regardless of status.

Click on any pull request in the list to edit, review or even merge the
code. When you hover over a pull request's row you'll see more details, including the repo, branches and status. You'll also see an option to view the pull request on your code-hosting service toward the end of the row. 

Hover over any section's heading for options to refresh the list, edit the section's query, or to delete the section.

![Query Header](/images/PRQueryHeader.png)

The first section actually allows you to load any pull request via URL. Just grab the URL of any pull request, paste it in, and you can view it right inside CodeStream.

When you hover over the Pull Requests section heading, icons appear at the right.

Options there include the ability to refresh all the sections (or queries) at once, create a new pull request, and to create a new section based on a custom query. Note that there are some special guidelines when creating a custom query for [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](#github) or for [GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed](#gitlab).

![Custom Query](/images/PRCustomQuery.png)

Click on the gear icon for more options, including the ability to see pull requests from all repositories, and not just those associated with repositories open in your IDE, and the ability to include labels in the list.

## GitHub custom queries [#github]

By default, GitHub's search API does a global search across all of GitHub. As a result, you'll need to make sure that your query includes at least one of the following qualifiers to make sure that the result set is appropriately limited.

* `user:USERNAME`
* `org:ORGNAME`
* `repo:USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
* `author:USERNAME`
* `assignee:USERNAME`
* `mentions:USERNAME`
* `team:ORGNAME/TEAMNAME`
* `commenter:USERNAME`
* `involves:USERNAME`
* `reviewed-by:USERNAME`
* `review-requested:USERNAME`
* `team-review-requested:TEAMNAME`
* `project:PROJECT_BOARD`

More details about GitHub's search syntax can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

## GitLab custom queries [#gitlab]

All searches are done using `attribute=value` format with an `&` between each parameter. For parameters with a space in them, leave them as-is and do not put quotes in the parameter (for example, `labels=foo,help wanted`). You can use `@me` to specify your user id and user name otherwise they can be found on GitLab. All filters, by default, have parameter `scope=all` (see [Minimum Qualifiers](#minimum)). To overwrite this, use `scope=X`. See examples given below.

### Searching by project

To search in a specific project use parameter `project_id=X`. Project IDs are listed when viewing the project on GitLab. Searching through a project, by default, uses `scope=all` and will return all merge requests or issues for the project specified. Only one `project_id` may be listed at a time.

```
project_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
iids[]=1&project_id=473&labels=bug
```

### Searching by group

To search in a specific group use parameter `group_id=X`. Group IDs are listed when viewing the group on GitLab. Searching through a group, by default, uses `scope=all` and will return all merge request or issues for the group specified. Only one `group_id` may be listed at a time.

```
group_id=23&state=opened&assignee_id=@me
iids[]=1&group_id=473&labels=bug
```

### Minimum qualifiers [#minimum]

By default, custom filters use `scope=all` which searches across all of GitLab. To avoid pulling all merge requests or issues listed on GitLab, you will need to refine this search using at least one of the following qualifiers:

* `scope=assigned\_to\_me`
* `scope=created\_by\_me`
* `project_id`
* `group_id`
* `author_id`
* `author_username`
* `assignee_id`
* `assignee_username`
* `my\_reaction\_emoji`

Search syntax is derived from GitLab's custom search API. Refer to GitLab's documentation for more details on [merge request searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html) or [issue searches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html).
