The CodeStream sidebar surfaces all the items you need to see, and do, in a
customizable tree-based view that is always available.

Subsequent articles will go into more detail on each section, but here's a quick
overview.

* [Pull Requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section) - If your team uses GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to host your code, you'll see all of your open pull requests listed and you can just click on one to edit it or perform a review.
* [Feedback Requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/feedback-requests-section) - Any open feedback requests either assigned to you or requested by you are listed.
* [Codemarks](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/codemarks-section) - Whether they originated in a pull request, a feedback request, or through ad-hoc code comments/issues, "codemarks" are the discussions that annotate your codebase and all of the codemarks in the current repository are listed for reference.
* [Observability](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/observability-section) - Track error assigned to you on New Relic One, and discover recent errors in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
* [Issues](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/issues-section) - See all of your open issues, across multiple services, in one place, and click on one to update its status, create a feature branch to do your work, and even update your status on Slack.

The CodeStream sidebar is completely customizeable. Use drag-and-drop to reorder
the sections. Resize each one individually. Expand or collapse a section as
needed. There's also an option to maximize a section when you want to get a good
view of a longer list. 

If there's a section you don't think you'll be using, you can hide it via the
View menu by clicking on your headshot at the top of the CodeStream pane.

At the top-right of the CodeStream pane you'll find access to some options for
creating and discovering content in your team.

* [My Organization](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/myorganization) - See who is in your CodeStream organization, invite new members, and create blame maps.
* [Filter & Search](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/filter-and-search) - Filter & Search allows you to slice and dice your team’s collection of code comments/issues and feature requests however you see fit.

And lastly, at the top-left of the CodeStream pane, click on your username for
options related to [account settings](/docs/codestream/codestream-settings/account-settings), [notifications](/docs/codestream/codestream-integrations/notifications) and [organization
administration](/docs/codestream/codestream-settings/team-administration).
