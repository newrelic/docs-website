customizable tree-based view that is always available.

<figcaption>The main sidebar sections are: Pull requests, Feedback requests, Codemarks, Observability, and Issues.</figcaption>

## Sidebar overview [#overview]

Here's a quick overview of the sidebar sections:

* [Pull requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section) - If your team uses GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to host your code, you'll see all of your open pull requests listed here. Click a specific pull request to start reviewing or editing it.
* [Feedback requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/feedback-requests-section) - If you've been assigned a feedback request or you've requested feedback from someone else, find those listed here.
* [Codemarks](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/codemarks-section) - Codemarks are the discussions that annotate your codebase. Codemarks are created pull requests, feedback requests, or through ad hoc code comments/issues. All of the codemarks in your current repository are listed for reference.
* [Observability](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/observability-section) - Track errors assigned to you in New Relic One and discover recent errors in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
* [Issues](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/issues-section) - See all of your open issues, across multiple services, in one place. Click a specific issue to update its status, create a feature branch to do your work, and update your status on Slack.

The CodeStream sidebar is completely customizable: 

* Drag and drop the sections to reorder them. 
* Click and drag a section divider to resize the sections on either side. 
* Expand or collapse each section as needed. 
* Click the maximize button in each section to fill the whole screen. This is useful when you're looking at a longer list. Click it again to return to your previous view.

## The username menu [#username]

* **Organization admin**: Manage your organization settings. Also, export your data and delete your organization.
* **Switch organization**: Use this if you're a member of more than one organization.
* **Integrations**: Connect CodeStream to the code host, issue, and messaging providers you use.
* **New Relic setup**: Connect your New Relic account to CodeStream to get the most out of New Relic CodeStream's observability tools.
* **Feedback**: Got feedback for us? Write a GitHub issue.
* **Help**: Links to documentation, our video library, keybindings, the CodeStream workflow, what's new, and reporting an issue.
