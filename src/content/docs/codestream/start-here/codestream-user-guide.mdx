## 1. Install the CodeStream extension in your IDE and sign up. [#install]

Install CodeStream for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream), [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream). The CodeStream pane automatically appears in the sidebar for VS Code or in a tool window at the right side for JetBrains or Visual Studio. Click **Sign Up and Create a team** if you're the first person from your team to join CodeStream or paste in your invitation code if you were invited to a team already on CodeStream.

## 5. Create or review a pull request [#pr]

Look for the **Pull Requests** section of the CodeStream sidebar to review an open pull request. Just click on a pull request (or load one from URL) to get a complete GitHub experience right in your IDE!
