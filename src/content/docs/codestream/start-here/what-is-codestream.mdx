New Relic CodeStream is an IDE extension that allows you to shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

* Get performance data for individual methods in the code, including notifications about poorly performing methods.
* Get actionable information, such as errors, vulnerabilities and non-compliant SLOs, for the services built from your code.
* Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.
* Discuss any block of code, with options for sharing to Slack or Teams, or create a ticket on Jira, Trello and many other issue trackers.

## Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.

## Investigate Errors

Discover errors happening in the code youâ€™re responsible for. Quickly step through the stack trace, with CodeStream automatically taking you to the correct file and line number, then bring relevant teammates into the discussion so that you can resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## Application Performance Monitoring

Get an in-IDE view of how the services built from your code are performing, in any environment. Golden metrics, service-level objectives and related services give you the big picture at a glance.

## Simplified Code Discussion

Rather than copying & pasting, just select code in your editor and start a discussion that teammates can participate in from their IDE, their email client or Slack/Teams. CodeStream automatically builds a knowledge base for your team by capturing these discussions that currently get lost in Slack threads and email chains, and saving them alongside the code that they refer to. The whole team, including future members of the team, gets the benefit of working from an annotated codebase.
