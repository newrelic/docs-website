New Relic CodeStream is a developer collaboration platform that enables your development team to discuss and review code in a natural and contextual way. CodeStream not only makes your discussions easier, by allowing them to happen in context in your IDE, but it also preserves the institutional knowledge that is currently being lost in Slack channels and emails.

CodeStream supports a developer's workflow from the time they grab a Jira ticket at the start of a development sprint to the merging of the code via pull request. And with the integration with New Relic, CodeStream goes beyond that and allows developers to see how the code they're responsible for is performing in production.

If you haven't already, [sign up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) so that you can get the most out of New Relic CodeStream. Need help getting started? Reach out to us at [codestream@newrelic.com](mailto:codestream@newrelic.com).

## Monitor your code’s performance in production [#performance-monitoring]

Your pursuit of software quality doesn’t end once the code has been merged. Code-level metrics give you an always-on, pervasive view into how your code is performing at the method level. Developers don't need to seek out telemetry data, as it's displayed contextually right in the editor!

Developers can also be more proactive about the quality of their code by discovering production errors right in their IDE. Navigate the stack trace to find the offending code and collaborate with your teammates to resolve the issue. You can also jumpt straight into your IDE from stacktrace errors in the errors inbox on New Relic.

## Discuss code just like commenting on a Google Doc [#discuss]

Simply select a block of code and type your question or comment. Teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE and you can optionally share the discussion on Slack or Microsoft Teams so teammates can participate from their chat clients as well.

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code and saving it with your code. And the real magic is that the discussions are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.

## Get feedback on work-in-progress with pre-Pull Request code review [#feedback]

CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you have someone look over your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing, or issuing a pull request.

  Once you've made some changes to a file, in the **Feedback requests** section, click the **+** button to request feedback on that change.

Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.

CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that hasn’t even been committed? Request feedback on your work in progress so that you can identify and resolve issues early instead of saving those gotchas for when you need to get the code merged.

## Create and review pull requests [#prs]

For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's [feedback requests](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/request-feedback) as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, you can create and review pull requests right inside your IDE.
