New Relic CodeStream is a developer collaboration platform that makes it
incredibly easy for development teams, especially remote teams, to discuss and
review code in a more natural and contextual way. CodeStream not only makes
discussions easier, by allowing them to happen in your IDE, in context, but also
preserves the institutional knowledge that is currently being lost in Slack
channels and emails. 

## Discuss code just like commenting on a Google Doc [#discuss]

Simply select a block of code and type your question or comment. Teammates can
participate in the discussion right from their IDE, and you can optionally share
the discussion on Slack or Microsoft Teams so teammates can participate from
their chat clients as well.

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the
discussion about your code and saving it with your code. And the real magic is
that the discussions are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even
across branches. All with zero effort on your part.

## Get feedback on work-in-progress with pre-PR code review [#feedback]

CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you have someone look over your
changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of
committing, pushing or issuing a pull request.

Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file
context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or
pull the latest.

CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them
throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a
few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that
hasn’t even been committed? Request feedeback on your work in progress so that
you can identify and resolve issues early instead of saving those gotchas for
when you need to get the code merged.

## Create and review pull requests [#prs]

For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull
request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's [feedback
requests](../workflow/feedback-requests) as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to,
your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of
that workflow right in your IDE. You can create pull requests, and review pull
requests, right inside your IDE.

## Monitor your code’s performance in production [#performance-monitoring]

Your pursuit of software quality doesn’t end once the code has been merged.
Connect CodeStrea to your New Relic One account and you can either jump from an
error on New Relic One into your IDE, or you can discover errors right from the
Observability section in CodeStream. Navigate the stack trace to find the
offending code, and collaborate with your teammates to resolve the issue.
