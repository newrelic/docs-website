CodeStream will notify you about comments and issues that you follow. Look for the **Notifications** option under your user profile menu at the top of the CodeStream pane.

## Notifications for comments and issues [#codemarksandFRs]

By default, you're set to automatically follow any comment or issue that you created, where you’ve been mentioned (either in the original post or in a subsequent reply), or to which you’ve replied. You can always choose to follow or unfollow any individual comment or issue via its ellipses menu.

You can choose whether you want to be notified via email, desktop, or both. Email notifications are sent immediately, and you can participate in the discussion by replying to the email. Your reply will get added to CodeStream as a reply to the appropriate comment or issue. Be sure that when you reply you're doing so from the same email address where the notification was sent (that is, your email address as show on your **Profile** on CodeStream).

Desktop notifications in the IDE are only available if you’re using VS Code or a JetBrains IDE.

## Additional email notifications [#additionalemail]

CodeStream also offers the following email notifications.

* **Send me weekly emails summarizing my activity**: Sent every Monday with information about you and your organization's activity for the previous week.

## Additional desktop notifications [#additionaldesktop]

CodeStream also offers the following desktop notifications.

* **Notify me about performance issues**: New methods in the code that are performing poorly will trigger a toast notification, based on code-level metrics [anomaly detection](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoriing#clm-anomalies). Note that if you have multiple repositories open in your IDE and/or multiple services associated with those repositories, you'll only get notified about the first method with anomalous performance. Be sure to check **Code-Level Metrics** in the **Observability** section for the complete list.
