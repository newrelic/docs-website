New Relic CodeStream will notify you about codemarks and feedback requests that you follow. Look for the **Notifications** option under your user profile menu at the top of the CodeStream pane.

## Notifications for codemarks and feedback requests [#codemarksandFRs]

By default, you're set to automatically follow any codemark or feedback request that you created, where you’ve been mentioned (either in the original post or in a subsequent reply), or to which you’ve replied. You can always choose to follow or unfollow any individual codemark or feedback request via its ellipses menu.

You can choose whether you want to be notified via email, desktop, or both. Email notifications are sent immediately, and you can participate in the
discussion by replying to the email. Your reply will get added to CodeStream as a reply to the appropriate codemark or feedback request. Be sure that when you reply you're doing so from the same email address where the notification was sent (that is, your email address listed in **My Organization** on CodeStream).

Desktop notifications in the IDE are only available if you’re using VS Code or a JetBrains IDE.

## Additional email notifications [#additionalemail]

CodeStream also offers the following email notifications.

* **Send me an email reminder for outstanding feedback requests**: Get an email reminder about open feedback requests assigned to you that you haven't responded to in the last 24 hours.
* **Send me weekly emails summarizing my activity**: Sent every Monday with information about you and your organization's activity for the previous week.

## Additional desktop notifications [#additionaldesktop]

CodeStream also offers the following desktop notifications.

* **Notify me about performance issues**: New methods in the code that are performing poorly will trigger a toast notification, based on code-level metrics [anomaly detection](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoriing#clm-anomalies). Note that if you have multiple repositories open in your IDE and/or multiple services associated with those repositories, you'll only get notified about the first method with anomalous performance. Be sure to check **Code-Level Metrics** in the **Observability** section for the complete list.
* **Notify me about new unreviewed commits from teammates when I pull**: Any time you pull, if there are new commits from a teammate on the current branch you'll get a toast notification. Click the **Review** button to start reviewing your teammate's changes and provide feedback.
* **Notify me about pull requests assigned to me**: If you've connected to GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab or GitLab Self-Managed to leverage CodeStream's [pull request integration](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/pull-requests), you'll also be notified when a pull request is assigned to you or you are added as a reviewer.
