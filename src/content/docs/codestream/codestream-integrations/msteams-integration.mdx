Connect New Relic CodeStream to your Microsoft Teams channel.

When you post a codemark your teammates will get notified via the activity feed,
and potentially via email. Sometimes, though, you might want to share to
Microsoft Teams as well. This would allow you to reach people who haven’t yet
joined CodeStream, or maybe don’t spend a lot of time in their IDE. 

## Connect to Microsoft Teams [#connect]

1. [Click here to install the CodeStream
   app](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/7cf49ab7-8b65-4407-b494-f02b525eef2b?source=store-copy-link)
   or go to apps in your Microsoft Teams sidebar and search for CodeStream.

1. Once installed you should see the following popup for the CodeStream app,
   click the **Add** button. Note, do not expand it and select the options to add
   to team or chat. Simply click Add.

1. This will take you to your private chat with the CodeStream bot, and you’ll
   see the CodeStream logo appear in the Teams sidebar. Type `signin` in this
   chat and submit.

1. A post from the bot will appear in the stream, along with a **Sign in** button.

   paste into your chat with the CodeStream bot back in MS Teams.

   command. Repeat this in any channel that you'd like to share to.

   CodeStream.

   that you just connected.

## Participate in CodeStream from Microsoft Teams [#participate]

When you share to Microsoft Teams, not only does it notify your teammates about the
codemark, but they can use it to jump directly into their IDEs to participate in
the conversation on CodeStream.

### Open in IDE [#open-ide]

Click **Open in IDE** to view both the code and the discussion right inside your
IDE. You’re taken through a CodeStream web page where you can choose
which IDE to open. CodeStream remembers your selection the next time
you view a discussion from the same repository. You’re then taken to the
appropriate source file in your IDE, scrolled to the relevant block of code,
with the discussion displayed in the CodeStream pane. If you don’t happen to
have that repository open in your IDE, CodeStream will automatically open
the source file for you (assuming you’ve opened that repository previously, with
CodeStream installed, so that we know where to find it).

If you’re using a JetBrains IDE, install the
[Toolbox app](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) so that CodeStream can
deep link into the IDE.

### Open on GitHub (or Bitbucket or GitLab) [#open-github]

If the code block is from a repository hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, this
button will take you to the corresponding block of code on that hosting service.
