Connect New Relic CodeStream to your team's Slack channel.

When you post a comment, issue, or feedback request, your teammates are notified via the activity feed, and potentially via email. Sometimes, though, you might want to share to Slack as well. This allows you to reach people who haven’t yet joined CodeStream or maybe don’t spend a lot of time in their IDE. 

## Share to Slack [#share]

When posting a comment, issue, or feedback request, click the Slack link at the bottom of the form to take you off to the web to authenticate with one of your Slack workspaces.

Once you’ve connected to a workspace, select the channel or direct message you'd like to share to.

By default, CodeStream will remember if and where you last shared to and the form will default to the same selection the next time. If you’d like to choose a default channel to use based on the repository you're in, click the gear menu at the top of the post to popup, and then set the default behavior for each repository.

You can also share an existing post to Slack, even one created by a teammate. Go to a comment, issue, or feedback request and look for the **Share** option under the ellipses menu.

Look for the **Shared To** section to keep track of where a post has been shared. Click on an entry to go straight to that conversation on Slack.

## Participate from Slack [#participate]

A comment, issue, or feedback request shared to Slack is much more powerful than a simple notification. Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from Slack.

### View discussions and reply [#discussions]

Your teammates can click **View Discussion & Reply** to add a reply.That reply is posted to CodeStream. Any previous replies are displayed as well so that they can catch up on the entire discussion.

Your teammates don’t need to be CodeStream users in order to participate in discussions via Slack.

### Open in IDE [#open-idea]

Click **Open in IDE** to view both the code and the discussion right inside your IDE. You’re first taken through a CodeStream web page where you’ll choose which IDE to open. CodeStream remember your selection the next time you view a discussion from the same repository. You’re then taken to the appropriate source file in your IDE, scrolled to the relevant block of code, with the discussion displayed in the CodeStream pane. If you don’t happen to have that repository open in your IDE, CodeStream automatically opens the source file for you (assuming you’ve opened that repository previously, with CodeStream installed, so that we know where to find it).

If you’re using a JetBrains IDE, install the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) so that CodeStream can deep link into the IDE.

### Open on GitHub (or Bitbucket or GitLab) [#open-github]

If the code block is from a repository hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, this button will take you to the corresponding block of code on that hosting service.

## Resolve codemarks and feedback requests [#resolve]

When a codemark or feedback request gets resolved, approved, rejected, or reopened, a reply is automatically posted to any corresponding conversations on Slack.

Many organizations have non-developers that participate in discussions, or at least passively monitor them, through Slack, and these notifications help keep those people in the loop as discussions or feedback requests get resolved.
