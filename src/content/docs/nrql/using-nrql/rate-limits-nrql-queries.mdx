Our New Relic query language, NRQL, has rate limits in place for each New Relic organization to ensure that our customers' rate of querying doesn't affect the experience of other customers.

You should rarely encounter limits on your NRQL queries. Here are some guidelines to follow to ensure query limiting will be rare:

* Limit the number of complex queries (for example, queries with `FACET` or `TIMESERIES` clauses, or queries of over a million events) that run at the same time.
* Limit the number of queries running concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of five, especially if they include complex queries.

To see if you're hitting query-related limits, use the [Limits UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/).

## NRQL query limits [#query-limits]

We have limits on:

* How long a query can run before erroring and stopping.
* The number of queries you can make in a given time range.

### Query duration limit [#query-duration]

The query duration limit is how long a NRQL query can run before it stops running and is considered an error. This limit depends on your [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices):

* Original Data option: 1 minute
* Data Plus:
  * 10 minutes (using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) or [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial))
  * 2 minutes in other UI locations aside from the query builder

The default timeout for querying with NerdGraph is 5 seconds.

### Limits on number of queries [#query-count-limits]

This limit only applies for NRQL queries run via our APIs, and doesn't apply to queries run from the UI.

This limit is 3,000 queries per account per minute. When you exceed this limit, queries may be rejected until the number of queries no longer exceeds the limit.
