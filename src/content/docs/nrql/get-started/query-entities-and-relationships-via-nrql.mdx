Understanding the intricate connections within your systems and quickly troubleshooting issues is crucial. If you're an **Advanced Compute** customer, you can now **directly query entity and relationship data within New Relic Database (NRDB) using the familiar New Relic Query Language (NRQL)**. This powerful capability allows you to seamlessly join this vital information with your telemetry data, all in one place.

This document shows you how to leverage this unified data access to **gain comprehensive insights faster** and achieve a more holistic understanding of your environment. You'll explore how to:

* Access and query your entity and relationship data directly in NRDB.
* Simplify correlation between entities, their relationships, and associated telemetry.
* Utilize practical NRQL examples for common use cases, like correlating CPU usage with host attributes or tracking entity state changes over time.

### Comprehensive insights with Unified data access with NRQL

Are you looking to simplify how you understand your systems and troubleshoot issues faster? We've centralized your data by bringing entities and their relationships directly into NRDB. This means you can now use the power of NRQL to get a complete picture of your environment, all in one place.

Here's how you benefit:

* **Access all your entity data directly in NRDB:** You'll find that your entity and relationship data is now ingested and stored in NRDB. This creates a unified datastore, making it the central place for this critical information alongside your telemetry data.
* **Query with ease using NRQL:** You can use the powerful and flexible NRQL you're already familiar with to query this entity and relationship data. This simplifies your workflow, as you don't need to learn new query languages or perform complex joins across different data stores. Your queries become more straightforward and easier to manage.
* **Get timely insights with 24-hour data availability:** Wondering if the data will be there when you need it? This entity and relationship data is retained in NRDB for a 24-hour period. This availability allows you to perform timely analysis and correlation, so you can quickly retrieve the information needed to understand system behavior and identify dependencies.
* **Achieve a holistic view with simplified correlation:** You can now effortlessly link entities, their relationships, and your associated telemetry data (like metrics, events, logs, and traces). This improved correlation capability means you get a complete picture of your environment's health and performance, enabling you to troubleshoot issues more efficiently and gain faster insights.
