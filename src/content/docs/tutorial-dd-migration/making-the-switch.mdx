If you've followed our tutorial series, you've learned a little about how New Relic works firsthand. You've instrumented your entities for infrastructure, applications, and logs to start really seeing how your stack works together. You've setup a premade dashboard to visualize the data across your stack, and you've set up an alert or two to help monitor issues that could arise with your systems.

<img

But what if you need to do more with your data? What if you need to use synthetic monitors to test your agents to make sure everything runs smoothly without customer interaction? What if you need to query hyper-specific data points to uncover in-depth information that you can't find anywhere else? What if you need an observability solution that's low on cost but still high on functionality?

Digging deeper into New Relic features will help you do all that and more, and you can continue to explore the platform [for free](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free). One of our core principles is to help you do your best work every day using their data at every phase of development. Once you make the switch, you'll never look at your data the same way again.

## Do more with your data [#do-more]

We've got a whole suite of observability solutions based on whatever data you're ingesting. We also offer tools and resources to help you capture and observe custom data, such as events and attributes, that you send to us. You can setup these data points to be whatever you need them to be depending on your needs. Check out our docs on [custom events and attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-custom-event-data/) to learn more.

Once you have your infrastructure, application, and log monitors set up, you can use any of the following observability features to help you get the most out of your stack.

    title="Synthetics"
  >
    Create tests using synthetic input to simulate traffic, resolve ability issues, and measure uptime with zero effects on your users. Test what you need when you need it, no matter how specific your needs are.

    * Simulated traffic can be public or private across thousands of possible locations
    * Find out about sub-optimal performance before your customers have a chance to know about them
    * Get full context on your stack to identify specifically where your issues are arising from
    * Use our synthetic testing in pre-production environments, or adjust any pages that are already in production

    Learn more about synthetics in our [short overview](https://newrelic.com/platform/synthetics), or see our [introduction to synthetics](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/) documentation.

    id="browser"
    title="Browser monitoring"
  >
    Get complete and total observability for your web pages, whether your site is large or small. Measure your core web vitals and errors to ensure a satisfying customer experience from the first click to the last.

    * Install browser agents as quickly as you would any other using our guided installations
    * Find out what's causing issues with how customers interact with your site from the beginning to the end of a transaction
    * Monitor your AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and more as they occur in real time so you can resolve any issues before they become problems
    * Customize your monitoring charts and share them across your organization so everyone has the same context you do.

  <Collapser
    id="d-tracing"
    title="Distributed tracing"
  >
    Get every data point from every single trace in one centralized location. Find only what you need among your trace when you need it, and eliminate hunting through pages of data to identify issues when they arise

    * Automatically instrument distributed tracing to start observing your data almost instantly
    * Utilize the seemless integration with our APM agents and let the two features work in tandem to reduce your workload
    * Capture representative activity samples with our head-based sampling approach
    * Take advantage of our <DNT>**Infinite Tracing**</DNT>, a feature that users tail-based sampling approaches that gathers information at the end of a trace and lets you know what's most important

    Learn more about distributed tracing in our [introduction to distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing/) documentation.

    id="NRQL"
    title="NRQL: New Relic's query language"
  >
    Maximizing your data requires the ability to query what you need down to the smallest detail, and that's exactly what New Relic's query language (NRQL) provides. Similar to ANSI SQL, you can use our language as a foundation to get any number of details about your data in our platform.

    * Build charts, dashboards, and <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> from anywhere in our platform using the NRQL console
    * Take advantage of our free tutorials and New Relic University courses to learn everything you need to know about the language
    * Explore your data in ways no other platform can provide and get every detail on any aspect of observability
    * Use NRQL to make queries and perform specific configurations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API

    Learn more about [how NRQL works](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/), or see our [introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) documentation.

    As your stack grows, security issues become an ever growing problem to tackle. Our vulnerability management solution gives you insight into what you need so that you can make sure to maintain compliance across your entire system.

    * Sync up security with all of your teams from one centralized location and streamline issue management
    * Prevent accidental vulnerabilities and breaches across your entire organization with automatic identification
    * Detect your vulnerabilities in minutes, letting you fix them before they grow into large-scale problems
    * See recommended updates automatically and ensure you're up-to-date on all your security needs

    New Relic CodeStream is an IDE extension that allows you to make code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process.

    * See how the services built from your code are performing, with information about golden metrics, errors, transaction anomalies, SLOs, and more.
    * Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.
    * Search logs from your IDE to investigate issues without context switching.
    * Run NRQL queries, save, and share queries with your teammates via `.nrql` files.
    * See performance data for individual methods in the code, right in the editor.

    Learn more about CodeStream in our [short overview](https://newrelic.com/codestream), or see our [introduction to CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/what-is-codestream/) documentation.

In addition to a suite of observability options, New Relic gives you the option to set up and report on custom data, like events and attributes to capture any data that you may want to see. You can setup these data points to be whatever you need them to be to match the needs of your organization. Check out our docs on [custom events and attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-custom-event-data/) to learn more.

## Pricing you want, functionality you need [#pricing]

Having the capabilities you need in a data monitoring solution is important, but cost often proves to be just as pivotal a factor, if not more so. We offer flexible, transparent [pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing). We believe organizations of any size should have the access to the features they need to monitor data, so we base our pricing around the amount of data and the number of users, not availability of features.

We even offer a forever-free edition, with full access to all our capabilities and features, and you only need to upgrade if your data needs to grow. Test out our capabilities at no cost to see how we help you make the most of your data, then upgrade to our Pro edition, designed for multiple engineers and complex workloads, or our Enterprise edition, designed for at-scale organizations with advanced security and support needs. All our editions include:

* 100 GB of free data ingest per month
* Unlimited basic users
* Unlimited hosts and CPUs
* Full querying capabilities
* Custom charts and dashboards
* Custom alerts and notifications

We know that cost can be a difficult point and that every organization has different observability needs, so we've created a number of resources to help you save costs. We have a [comprehensive overview of pricing](https://newrelic.com/pricing), as well as information on [accurately estimating your data ingest costs](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost).

New Relic is committed to enabling you do the most with your data without any limits while helping you keep the costs down for you and your team. When you're ready to make the switch, or even if you just have questions about migrating over, [reach out to us](https://newrelic.com/competitive-comparison/datadog-savings) at any time. We'll answer any questions you have and help you make the cost comparison, and we'll do everything we can to help you get started.
