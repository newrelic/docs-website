You can decide to switch data monitoring products for a variety of reasons. Whatever the reason, you can try New Relic for yourself without needing to fully migrate your stack over from Datadog. We've provided a series of tutorials to help you get started monitoring your system with New Relic, as well as understanding how New Relic observability works. Below, you'll find information on setting up monitoring for infrastructure, applications, and logs, as well as dashboards and <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to help you really control your data.

The only prerequisite is a New Relic account: [sign-up for free](https://newrelic.com/signup) and you're ready to get started!

## Use entities for full-stack observability[#entities]

At New Relic, we use the concept of entities to help us divide up and organize data. Essentially, anything that reports data to or contains data for New Relic that can be identified with a unique ID is an entity. We use a powerful mapping system to fully link entities together. For you, that means more granular and transparent monitoring of nearly any data type from nearly any source. All this to let you see exactly the data your care about at any level, without cluttering up your monitoring with things you don't want or need.

## Exploring premade dashboards [#dash]

Wouldn't it be great if you could see all your observability data without having to set anything up? New Relic offers curated interfaces to give you just that and more. From the moment you start ingesting data, you'll have access to highly detailed levels of information from the get-go, as well a host of easy to use features that let you sort, find, contextualize, and investigate that data with just a click or two.

This tutorial series will cover these curated interfaces in the form of premade dashboards for infrastructure, application, and log monitoring. We'll also show you where to go to find hundreds of preconfigured dashboards for our other features. Spend less time setting up your tools and more time actually using them with New Relic.
