New Relic's instrumentation for Azure Functions offers deep visibility into the inner workings of your functions. By adding the New Relic agent to your function, each invocation is monitored by New Relic. This enables you to track the duration of function invocations, monitor errors, see distributed tracing, and record details about the source events and your function's responses.


<Callout variant="important">

For Azure Functions, the agent reports data such as distributed traces and logs, which are available under 'Services - APM' as an APM entity. However, a separate entity (provided by infrastructure monitoring) for Azure Functions still exists.
