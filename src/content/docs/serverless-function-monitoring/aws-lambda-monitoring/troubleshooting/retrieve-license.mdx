## Problem

You can't retrieve the New Relic license key `AccessDeniedException`.

## Solution

Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. In our examples, check out the `template.yaml` file to see an easy way to grant this permission.

    ```bash
    [output] Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN>
    ```
