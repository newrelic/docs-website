## Problem

You can't use AWS Secrets Manager to store your New Relic license key.

## Solution

If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension accepts a `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. Add the `--disable-license-key-secret` flag from the `newrelic-lambda integrations install` command. Then set this environment variable to your  <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> in your Lambda function configuration.
