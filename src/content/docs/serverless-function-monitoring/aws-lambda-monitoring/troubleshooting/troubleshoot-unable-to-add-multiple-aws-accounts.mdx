## Problem

You can't add multiple AWS accounts with their respective regions to the New Relic Lambda Extension.

## Solution

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI should be run once per region, with the `--aws-region` parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret needs to be created in each region.

Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The `--aws-profile` argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI.
