## Problem [#problem]

After generating traffic for your AWS Lambda function and waiting five minutes, none of your function data appears in the New Relic UI. There aren't any errors in the logs, and no `NRIntegrationErrors` or `NRIntegrationWarnings` in the New Relic UI.

## Solution [#solution]

### Check for license key and account ID [#check-license]

The most common reason for no data appearing and no errors is that the [license key and account ID](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/) are from different accounts. In the case of a mismatch, the [New Relic Lambda extension](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension) or [lambda that processes cloud watch logs](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) does report the data successfully, but silently drops it since the account ID doesn't match. This results in no errors or warnings.

To resolve this issue, make sure that the license key and account ID are from the same account. Using the [New Relic Lambda CLI](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/#rec) to enable serverless monitoring is recommended to minimize these types of issues. You can update the license key in the AWS Secrets Manager. For the account ID and configurations not using the AWS Secrets Manager, you can update the [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking/#env-var) with the correct license key or account ID to correct the problem.

### Check for Environment Variables [#check-env-vars]

Ensure that the necessary [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/env-variables-lambda) are set correctly in your AWS Lambda function. This includes the `NEW_RELIC_APM_LAMBDA_MODE`, `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`, `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`, and any other relevant variables. If these variables are not set or are incorrect, it can lead to data not being sent to New Relic. For more information, refer to [environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/env-variables-lambda).


### Check for tags on AWS Management Console [#check-tags]

Make sure that you've added the `NR.Apm.Lambda.Mode: true` tag to your Lambda function from the AWS Management Console. This tag is essential for enabling monitoring and ensuring that data is sent to New Relic.
