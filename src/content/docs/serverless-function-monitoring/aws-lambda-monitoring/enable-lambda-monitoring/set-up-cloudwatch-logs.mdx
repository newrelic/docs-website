title: "Step 2 (optional): Set up AWS CloudWatch log collection"
metaDescription: An optional step of setting up CloudWatch logs when enabling New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring.
---

This is an optional step in [enabling New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring). In [Step 1](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking), if you used the `newrelic-lambda` CLI, that automatically installs an AWS CloudWatch logs collector by default. If you didn't use that in Step 1, you can [configure CloudWatch logs yourself](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs).
