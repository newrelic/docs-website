In Step 1, if you used the newrelic-lambda CLI, it checked whether you had installed either the [API Polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring) or [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) integration. If it didn't see either of those, it installed the API Polling integration.

If you didn't use the CLI in Step 1, make sure you have installed and configured either the API Polling or Metric Streams integration.
