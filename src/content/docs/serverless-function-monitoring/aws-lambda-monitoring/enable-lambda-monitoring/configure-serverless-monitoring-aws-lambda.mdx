After you [enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring), you can add additional configuration to fine-tune your data.

## Enable Infinite Tracing [#infinite-tracing]

Distributed tracing is included by default if you set up your functions using Lambda layers.

If your Lambda functions communicate with services that use our tail-based distributed tracing called [Infinite Tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing), you should enable this feature for your Lambda functions. This ensures that your Lambda spans are included with the rest of the spans tracked by Infinite Tracing.

To set this up for your Lambda functions, see the [Infinite Tracing steps](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer) to create a trace observer and to select which Lambda functions (data sources) should report spans.

## Set up alerts [#alerts]

Our <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> let you get notifications on anything you can monitor with New Relic, including APM metrics, key transactions, NRQL queries, and more. See [our alerts documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).

## Add custom events [#custom-events]

Besides the data we provide by default, you can also set up your own [events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#event) or [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute).

For details about these language-specific settings, see [Configuring custom attributes and events in AWS Lambda](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/configuring-custom-attributes-and-events-in-aws-lambda/96043).
