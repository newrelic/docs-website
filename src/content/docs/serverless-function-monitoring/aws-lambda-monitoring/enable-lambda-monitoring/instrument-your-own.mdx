title: "Step 4: Instrument your own Lambda functions"
metaDescription: Step 4 of enabling New Relic AWS Lambda monitoring.
---

This is one step of [enabling New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring).

<Callout variant="important">
  Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing [an example](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/instrument-example/) function before instrumenting your own code.
</Callout>

## Deployment strategies [#strats]

There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case.

### `newrelic-lambda` CLI quickstart [#quickstarts]

The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use
New Relic.

To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run:

```
newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id">YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID</a> --function my-function --upgrade
```

This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime.

This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process.

Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use `--function all`, `--function installed`, or
`--function not-installed` to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing
New Relic instrumentation.

### Continuous deployment [#cont]

In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework.

    id="cloudformation"
    title="CloudFormation / SAM templates"
  >
    AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions
    to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for
    most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an
    addition layer of abstraction.

    At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using
    YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that
    target state.

    Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a Node.js Lambda function:

    ```yaml
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
    Description: And example of a simple instrumented Node.js Lambda

    Resources:
      NewRelicExample:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step.
          CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/
          # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below.
          Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler
          Runtime: nodejs12.x
          Environment:
            Variables:
              # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value
              NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler
              # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID
              NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
              # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just
              # your account id.
              NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
          Layers:
            # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry,
            # as well as the New Relic agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy.
            - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34
          Policies:
            # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so
            # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic
            - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy:
                SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN
    ```

    Conventionally, you'll have a file named `template.yaml` that describes your function, and its resources.

    Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in Node.js,
    and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions.

    New Relic offers a [Serverless Framework Plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers) to
    simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application.

    #### Install the plugin [#install]

    First,

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
    ```

    Or, alternatively,

    ```bash
    yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
    ```

    Find your [New Relic Account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id),
    your [New Relic Personal API Key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key)

    Then add the following to your `serverless.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    plugins:
      - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
    custom:
      newRelic:
        accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here
        apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here
        linkedAccount: your-new-relic-integration-account-name-here
    ```

    Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as
    well as many other things. We offer
    [some examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/tree/main/examples/terraform) of New Relic
    instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts.

## Unusual integrations [#edge]

For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these
solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on.

### CloudWatch telemetry [#cloudwatch-telemetry]

As [mentioned previously](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/architecture#cloudwatch)
we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated.

1. Disable the extension by adding the `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED` environment variable to your function,
   with the value `false`.
2. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function with the logs for your
   function.
   * The CLI can do this for you: `newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function FUNCTION_NAME`
   * Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to
     invoke the `newrelic-log-ingestion` lambda function. See below.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="manual-stream-logs"
    title="Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda"
  >
    1. Open CloudWatch and select **Logs** in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring.
    2. Select **Actions > Subscription filters > Create Lambda subscription filter**.
    3. Under **Lambda function**, select the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
    4. Set the **Log format** to `JSON`.
    5. Set the **Subscription filter pattern to** `?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?"Task timed out" ?RequestId`. Alternatively, if you are using the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable [stream all your logs](#stream-all-logs) to our Logs, leave this field blank.

       See [notes and caveats about this procedure](#stream-logs).

       <Callout variant="important">
         Make sure the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function.
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Lambda console UI configuration [#console]

While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the
configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for Node.js, Python and Java.

1. Find the [layer](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/) that matches your runtime and region.
2. Copy the _Amazon Resource Name_ (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function.
3. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function:
   * Python: `newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler` (underscores)
   * Node: `newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler` (hyphens)
   * Java:
     * `RequestHandler` implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest`
     * `RequestStreamHandlerWrapper` implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest`
4. Add these environment variables to your Lambda console:
   * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id)
   * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER`: Path to your initial handler.
5. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret

   1. Find the ARN of the secret named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
   2. Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the
      `SECRET_ARN` with the value you found above):

    ```json
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
        ],
        "Resource": "SECRET_ARN",
        "Effect": "Allow"
      }
    ]
    ```

Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it.
Configuration changes are not enough.

### Layer customization [#cust]

The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime:

1. For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer.
2. For Python, Node.js and Java, we also include:
   1. The New Relic agent
   2. The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic agent
   3. A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation
      process, then invokes your handler.

If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our
[newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-layers) for the code contained in
our wrapper function. By creating [your own layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html)
with a replacement wrapper, and applying it _after_ ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly,
you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function.

Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer
packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer.

We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it
makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored
agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work.
