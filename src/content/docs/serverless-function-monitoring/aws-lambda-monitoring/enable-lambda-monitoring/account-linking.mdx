This is the first step to [enable New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring).

When you link your AWS account to New Relic, you're granting permission to New Relic to create an inventory of your AWS account, and gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. Resources in your AWS account then show up as entities in the [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts#find), decorated with config information.

For Lambda serverless function monitoring to work, it requires either an [API Polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring) or [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) integration. You can set up your choice of integration before you start this account linking, or you can let the CLI install the API Polling integration for you.


<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="aws-permissions"
    title="AWS permissions details"
  >
    To create this inventory, we need an IAM role that grants these IAM permissions, at a minimum:

    ```yaml
    Resource: "*"
    Action: 
      - "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
      - "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
      - "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
      - "lambda:GetAccountSettings"
      - "lambda:ListFunctions"
      - "lambda:ListAliases"
      - "lambda:ListTags"
      - "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings"
    ```

    By default, we use the AWS Managed Policy `ReadOnlyAccess`. This allows the Infrastructure integration to see
    all the resources in your account, rather than just your Lambda functions and CloudWatch metrics. New Relic
    recommends this default, but we understand that some organizations have a very conservative security posture for
    third party integrations. A role with the permissions above is sufficient to allow Lambda telemetry collection,
    though traces that interact with other services may not work well.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

In this integration step, we'll also store your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> in the AWS Secrets Manager service, so that we
can send your telemetry to your New Relic account.

## Recommended method: The `newrelic-lambda` CLI [#rec]

### Requirements [#requirements]

To enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you need the following:

* [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured using `aws configure`.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.3 or higher installed.
* [newrelic-lambda CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation), which you can install by running `pip3 install newrelic-lambda-cli`.
* A New Relic account. You must have an admin role or have the **Infrastructure manager** [add-on role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#add-on).
* A <InlinePopover type="userKey" />.
* An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets.

For in-depth detail about the CLI, see [our CLI repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cli-aws-permissions"
    title="CLI user AWS permissions details"
  >
    The CLI uses the AWS SDK to interact with AWS. The SDK will act using the same default profile as the AWS CLI.
    This profile needs, at a minimum, the following AWS permissions to run the CLI.

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "CLIAccessPolicy",
                "Action": [
                    "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
                    "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                    "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
                    "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                    "iam:CreateRole",
                    "iam:GetRole",
                    "iam:PassRole",
                    "lambda:AddPermission",
                    "lambda:CreateFunction",
                    "lambda:GetFunction",
                    "logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter",
                    "logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters",
                    "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet",
                    "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
                "Sid": "NRLogAccessPolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate",
                    "serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Integrate with CLI [#cli]

Since Lambda serverless function monitoring requires either an [API Polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring) or [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) integration, the CLI will automatically install API Polling if it doesn't see an integration. If you prefer Metric Streams, install that now before running the CLI.

When all the [requirements](#requirements) are in place, link your AWS account with your New Relic account by running the following command using your [user key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key) (replace all the highlighted values):

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="aws-env-variables"
    title="AWS regions and profiles"
  >
    **Setting the region**
    To configure your region, use this [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) to override the default region:

    ```bash
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=MY_REGION # us-west-2, for example
    ```

    The CLI tool also allows passing this per-command using `--aws-region`.

    **Setting profiles**

    If you have multiple AWS profiles and don't want to use the default, use `AWS_PROFILE` [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) to set another profile name. Ensure the profile is properly configured (including the default region). Example:

    ```bash
    export AWS_PROFILE=MY_PROFILE
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

```
newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id">YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID</a> \
    --nr-api-key <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key">YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</a>
```

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI adds your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> as a secret in [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) for greater security.

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Storing the New Relic license key in the AWS Secrets Manager**

  Your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> identifies and authenticates you to New Relic, allowing us to associate your telemetry with your New Relic account. Each function that sends telemetry needs access to this value, and it needs to be managed securely. The AWS Secrets Manager solves these problems.

  If your organization prevents you from using AWS Secrets Manager or if you need to store more than one secret per region, see below for an alternative method to set your license key.
</Callout>

## Alternative method [#alt]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="manual-linking"
    title="Linking accounts manually"
  >
    ### The infrastructure monitoring UI

    The CLI is the least complicated way to link your accounts. Current CLI behavior limits the setup of one managed secret per region. If you need more control or need to integrate more than one New Relic account per region, you can go through
    the [linking process](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring)
    manually. Be sure to enable Lambda when selecting services to be monitored.

    Don't forget to configure the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret manually, as described next.

    ### Manually configure the license key secret

    In addition to linking your accounts, you need to configure the license key secret.

    1. Download this CloudFormation Template: [`license-key-secret.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli/blob/master/newrelic_lambda_cli/templates/license-key-secret.yaml)
    2. Using the AWS CLI, or the AWS CloudFormation Console, install the template, supplying the `LicenseKey` parameter.
       It
       will be labeled "INGEST - LICENSE". Be sure to use the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the account you configured with the Infrastructure UI above.

       AWS CLI example:

       Be sure to replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` and `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with the license key and account ID you found above.

       ```bash
       aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name NewRelicLicenseKeySecret 
           --template-body file://license-key-secret.yaml 
           --parameters 'ParameterKey=LicenseKey,ParameterValue=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' 
           'ParameterKey=NrAccountId,ParameterValue=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID'
           --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
       ```

       See also our [legacy docs on how to manually instrument your account](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/).

Here are more details on other problems and solutions. 

### Cannot use AWS secrets manager [#cannot-use-secrets]

If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension will accept a `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. Add the `--disable-license-key-secret` flag from the `newrelic-lambda integrations install` command. Then set this environment variable to your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> in your Lambda function configuration.

### Multiple AWS regions and accounts [#multiple-regions-accounts]

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI should be run once per region, with the `--aws-region` parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> secret needs to be created in each region.

Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The `--aws-profile` argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI.

### Lambda function not showing as instrumented [#not-instrumented]

You've instrumented your Lambda function but it is not showing as instrumented in the **Amazon Web Services -> Lambda functions** section of New Relic.

You've linked both an [API polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/) and [Metric Streams](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) integration to your New Relic account manually in the UI.

In this scenario with two integrations for the same AWS account in one New Relic account, a race condition will occur when instrumented payloads are received from the instrumented Lambda function at the New Relic [cloud-collector endpoint](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-extension/blob/54ccfd44765feb4b3da77ae606323c18d9db7593/telemetry/client.go#L18-L19). The payload will be randomly assigned to one of the two integrations. If assigned to the integration not linked to your function entity, the payload will be dropped and the function will not show as instrumented. Only functions that have received at least one payload in the last 30 days to the `AwsLambdaInvocation` event will show as instrumented.

```sql
FROM AwsLambdaInvocation SELECT count(*) SINCE 30 days ago WHERE entityGuid = 'ENTITY_GUID' LIMIT 1
```

To prevent creating two integrations for the same AWS account, we recommend you use the `newrelic-lambda` CLI, as mentioned above, because it will detect an existing integration and use it.

If two integrations have already been created, choose one to keep and unlink the other by clicking **Unlink this account** at **Infrastructure > AWS** in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
  There are some [limitations to Metric Streams integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/#integrations-not-replaced-streams) that should be considered before unlinking an API polling integration. There are also some [limitations to Infrastructure Dimensional metrics queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql/#known-limitations) which should be considered before fully committing to a Metric Streams integration.
</Callout>

### Failure to retrieve license key `AccessDeniedException` [#fail-retrieve-license]

Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. In our examples, check out the `template.yaml` file to see an easy way to grant this permission.

```
Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN>
```
