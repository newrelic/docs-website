This guide will cover how you can use [OpenTelemetry Lambda](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda) to trace your Java Lambda functions using AWS's managed [OpenTelemetry Lambda Layers](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-java-auto-instr). OpenTelemetry makes it easy to instrument your functions, including automatic instrumentation for many popular libraries. For additional information, see [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction).

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

This guide assumes you have the following:

* A New Relic account. If you don't have one, [create one for free](https://newrelic.com/signup).
* An AWS account. If you don't have one, [create one for free](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* Please refer to [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda#getting-started-with-aws-lambda-layers) for the most up to date requirements.

### (Optional) Enable X-Ray [#xray]

Even though we're not using AWS X-Ray in this setup, we still need to enable X-Ray in the Lambda function to enable the tracing features built into AWS OpenDistro.

To enable X-Ray:

1. Open your function in the [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).
2. Choose <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT>, then <DNT>**Monitoring Tools**</DNT>.
3. Choose <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
4. Under <DNT>**X-Ray**</DNT>, enable <DNT>**Active tracing**</DNT>.

Alternatively, if you're using [SAM (Serverless Application Model)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) or [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/resources/templates/) templates, you can enable X-Ray by adding the following to your Lambda function's properties:

```yaml
yourFunctionHere:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    # ...
    Policies:
      - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
      # ...
      - AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess
    Tracing: Active
```

<Callout variant="important">
  This option requires that you have `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` or an equivalent policy attached to your function.
</Callout>

## New Relic environment variables [#env-variables]

To send the OpenTelemetry data that this layer collects to New Relic, we need to configure the OpenTelemetry Lambda Collector that is packaged with the layer to export the telemetry it receives to the [New Relic OpenTelemetry Endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start). Before we do that, we first need to set some environment variables that it will depend upon.

1. Generate and copy a New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> from your New Relic account.
2. Open up your function in the [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).
3. Choose <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT> and then <DNT>**Environment variables**</DNT>.
4. Under <DNT>**Environment variables**</DNT>, choose <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
5. Choose <DNT>**Add environment variable**</DNT>.
6. For the <DNT>**Key**</DNT> set it to `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and set the <DNT>**Value**</DNT> to the value of the license key you generated in step 1. Then choose <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.
7. Choose <DNT>**Add environment variable**</DNT> again.
8. For the <DNT>**Key**</DNT> set it to `NEW_RELIC_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` and set the <DNT>**Value**</DNT> to one of the options below (depends on your New Relic region). Then choose <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

   * `otlp.nr-data.net:4317`: If your New Relic account is in the US region
   * `otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317`: If your New Relic account is in the EU region

For SAM and CloudFormation templates, add the following to your function's properties. Be sure to replace `your-license-key-here` with your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> and `otlp.nr-data.net:4317` with the New Relic OpenTelemetry Endpoint for your region.

```yaml
yourFunctionHere:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    # ...
    Environment:
      Variables:
        # ...
        NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: your-license-key-here
        NEW_RELIC_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT: otlp.nr-data.net:4317
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Replace `your-license-key-here` with your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>, and `otlp.nr-data.net:4317` with the endpoint appropriate for your New Relic region. See the list above.
</Callout>

## Configure the Collector [#collector]

Now we will override the OpenTelemetry Lambda Collector's default configuration with one that exports telemetry to the New Relic OpenTelemetry endpoint. To do this we must include a `collector.yaml` config file with our function.

Create a `collector.yaml` file in your function's root directory with the following contents:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ${NEW_RELIC_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT}
    headers:
      api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Bundle this `collector.yaml` file in the root directory of your function's zip package and re-deploy.

1. Open your function in the [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).
2. Choose <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT> and then <DNT>**Environment variables**</DNT>.
3. Under <DNT>**Environment variables**</DNT>, choose <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
4. Choose <DNT>**Add environment variable**</DNT>.
5. For the <DNT>**Key**</DNT> set `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE` and set the <DNT>**Value**</DNT> to `/var/task/collector.yaml`.
6. Then choose <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

For SAM and CloudFormation templates, add this to your function's properties:

```yaml
yourFunctionHere:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    # ...
    Environment:
      Variables:
        # ...
        OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE: /var/task/collector.yaml
```

<Callout variant="important">
  This assumes you bundled your `collector.yaml` in your function's root directory. If you bundled it somewhere else, replace `/var/task/collector.yaml` with the path to your `collector.yaml`.
</Callout>

## View your data in the New Relic UI [#view-data]

First you will want to [invoke your Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html) a few times to start generating telemetry. From there, head over to New Relic to find your [traces](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?overlay=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), [metrics](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?overlay=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), and [logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?overlay=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).

Your telemetry will not appear under New Relic Serverless. Instead, you will find your telemetry data under the New Relic OpenTelemetry Nerdlets.

## Automatic instrumentation overhead [#auto-inst]

ADOT Lambda Layer for Java auto-instrumentation agent has a notable impact on startup
time on AWS Lambda, and you will generally need to use this along with [provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) to serve production requests without causing timeouts on initial requests while it initializes. We recommend testing this configuration in a non-production environment first to determine the appropriate settings for your use case.

Alternatively, you can use the following manual instrumentation method. By default, manual instrumentation requires fewer resources at function initialization. However, this
method requires a code change in most cases.

## Distributed Tracing [#distributed-tracing]

In some cases you may see fragmented distributed traces within New Relic with this configuration. This occurs when a trace starts or involves a service that is outside the ADOT context (for example, a managed AWS service). Spans from that service are created by X-Ray, not OpenTelemetry, and ADOT does not forward them to New Relic. Although the traces appear fragmented, they still provide complete insight into performance within the Lambda function as well as other services whose spans were forwarded to New Relic.
