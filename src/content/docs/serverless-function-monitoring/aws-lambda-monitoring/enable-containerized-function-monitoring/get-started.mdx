Containerized Lambda functions offer an alternative way to deploy code within AWS Lambda while still enjoying the benefits of serverless computing. 

With New Relic, you can monitor AWS Lambda functions deployed using containerized images, so that you can: 

* **Increase flexibility**: Use familiar container tooling and leverage pre-built images for your code and dependencies.
* **Improve security**: Benefit from container isolation and potential security advantages associated with containerized environments.
* **Ensure consistent runtime**: Ensure a consistent development, testing, and deployment environment.

## Requirements [#Requirements]

To create a containerized Lambda function using Node.js, you need the following:

* [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 2] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* [Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Node.js versions 16 or 18
* Python version 3.9+

<Steps>
<Step>
## Create a project directory [#project-directory]

When you build a containerized function the first step is to create a project directory. You can do this by completing these steps: 

1. Run: 
```
mkdir example_node
cd example_node
npm init
vi index.js and add the following code.
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
    return response;
};
```
2. Once you're finished, create a new Docker file with the following configuration:

```
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:18
# Copy function code COPY index.js
${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT} 
# Set the CMD to your handler (could also be done as a parameter override outside of the Dockerfile) 
CMD [ "index.handler" ]

```
3. Next, build the Docker image with the Docker build:

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t docker-image:test 
```
</Step>
<Step>
## Test the image locally (optional) [#test-image]

Before going any further we recommend testing the image locally to make sure everything works as expected. To do this complete the following:

1. Start the Docker image with the docker run command:

```
docker run -p 9000:8080 docker-image:test
```
2. From a new terminal window, post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:

```
curl "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
```

3. Get the container ID.

```
docker ps
```
4. Use the Docker kill command to stop the container. When you use this command, replace `3766c4ab331c` with the container ID from the previous step.

```
docker kill 3766c4ab331c
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Deploy the image [#deploy-image]

Now that you've successfully created the image, you will need to upload the image to Amazon ECR and create the Lambda function.  To do this, complete the following:

1. Run the `get-login-password` command to authenticate the Docker CLI to your Amazon ECR registry.
2. Set the `--region` value to the AWS Region where you want to create the Amazon ECR repository.
3. Replace 111122223333 with your AWS account ID.
```
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
4. Create a repository in Amazon ECR using the create-repository command.
```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hello-world --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
```
5. Copy the `repositoryUri` from the output in the previous step.
6. Run the [docker tag](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/tag/) command to tag your local image into your Amazon ECR repository as the latest version. In this command, replace `docker-image:test` with the name and tag of your Docker image. Then replace &lt; ECRrepositoryUri &gt; with the `repositoryUri` you copied. Ensure that you include `:latest` at the end of the URI.

```
docker tag docker-image:test <ECRrepositoryUri> :latest
EX: docker tag docker-image:test 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest
```
7. Now, run the docker push command to deploy your local image to the Amazon ECR repository. Ensure you include `:latest` at the end of the repository URI.
```
docker push 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest
```
</Step>
<Step>
## Create a containerized Lambda function [#create-containerized-function]

Now, you're ready to create a containerized Lambda function. 

Make sure to create an execution role for your function, if you don't already have one. For more information on this, see the [AWS documentation on creating an execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-awscli.html#with-userapp-walkthrough-custom-events-create-iam-role). For the next step, you will need the Amazon Resource Name, or ARN, of the role. 

Now, you are ready to create the Lambda function. When completing the following command, you must specify the repository URI from earlier for the `Image` and `ImageUri` fields. Ensure that you include `:latest` at the end of the URI.

```
aws lambda create-function \ --function-name hello-world \ --package-type Image \ --code ImageUri=111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest \ --role arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/lambda-ex
```
Next, you invoke the function:

```
aws Lambda invoke --function-name hello-world response.json
```

If you have any questions, see [AWS's documentation for deploying Lambda functions with container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-image.html).
