With containerized Lambda functions, you can create Lambda layers using container images. As an alternative to deploying layers as .zip archives, container images allow for increased flexibility and improved security.

Before you get started, make sure you've built a Dockerfile that includes your chosen runtime environment, installed your dependencies, and copied them into the correct directory structure. 

Once you've created the layer as an image, you'll push the image to an Amazon ECR repository. You will reference the image from Amazon ECR repository when you create your Lambda layer in the AWS Management Console. 

First, you need to create your image layers. Once that's done, you can either create a regular or a public ECR function. To help you with this, we've created a [gallery of New Relic Lambda layers for Docker hosted on Amazon ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/x6n7b2o2?page=1). Alternatively, follow these steps to create your own.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a New Relic Lambda layer as an image [#create-lambda-layer]

Before you can deploy your image, you first need to create a New Relic Lambda layer. To do this, complete the following steps: 

1. Choose from the different [Amazon Resource Name (ARN) layers available to you](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/#/get-layers/get) to find the one that matches your system.
2. Create a new docker image using the following code:
```
FROM alpine:latest as layer-copy 
# Create a build stage to copy the files from S3 using credentials ARG AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION:-"region"} 
ARG AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:-"accessKey"} 
ARG AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:-"secretkey"} ENV AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION} 
ENV AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} 
ENV AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} 
RUN apk add aws-cli curl unzip 
RUN mkdir -p /opt 
RUN curl $(aws lambda get-layer-version-by-arn --arn <ARN Link> --query 'Content.Location' --output text) --output layer.zip 
RUN unzip layer.zip -d /opt 
RUN rm layer.zip 
FROM scratch 
# Start second stage from blank image to squash all previous history, including credentials. 
WORKDIR /opt 
COPY --from=layer-copy /opt .
```
3. Push that image to Amazon ECR. 

```
docker build -t layer-image1:latest .
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy the image in AWS ECR [#deploy-image-ECR]

Now that you've created the image, you can deploy it using the following steps: 

1. Configure your AWS account from the terminal.
2. Authenticate your account using the following command:

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
3. Create a repository in Amazon ECR using the `create-repository` command:

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hello-world --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
```
4. Copy the `repositoryUri` from the output in the previous step.
5. To tag your local image into your Amazon ECR repository as the latest version, run the docker tag command: 
```
Replace docker-image:test with the name and tag of your Docker image.
```
6. Replace &lt; ECRrepositoryUri &gt;  with the `repositoryUri` that you copied. Make sure to include `:latest` at the end of the URI. Here is an example: 

```
docker tag docker-image:test <ECRrepositoryUri>:latest
```
7. Run the docker push command to deploy your local image to the Amazon ECR repository. Make sure to include `:latest` at the end of the repository URI. 
```
docker push 111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Create a Containerized Lambda function with New Relic layer image ECR [#lambda-function-image-layer]

Now that you've created the image layer, you can need to create a Lambda function. You can create either a public or regular ECR layer. 

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Lambda function with a New Relic image layer 

Now that you've created the image and deployed it to AWS ECR, now you need to create a Lambda function. To do this, complete the following steps:

1. Use the image URI from either the New Relic layer you chose or your own image layer and add the image URI to your Dockerfile. Here's an example:
```
FROM <image uri> AS layer
```
2. Add the directory for the layer. Here is an example:

```
# Layer code
WORKDIR /opt
COPY --from=layer /opt/ .
```
3. Here is a complete example:

```
FROM <image uri> AS layer
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.9
# Layer code
WORKDIR /opt
COPY --from=layer /opt/ .
WORKDIR ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Copy requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Copy function code
COPY lambda_function.py ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Install the specified packages
RUN pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Set the CMD to your handler (could also be done as a parameter override outside of the Dockerfile)
CMD [ "lambda_function.handler" ]
```
4. Push the image to Amazon ECR.
```
docker build -t docker-image-sample:latest 
```
</Step>
<Step>
###  Test the image locally (optional) [#test-image]

While this step is optional, we recommend testing the image locally to ensure everything works correctly. 

1. Start the Docker image with the docker run command:
```
docker run -p 9000:8080 docker-image-sample:latest
```
2. From a new terminal window, post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:

```
curl "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
```
</Step>
<Step>
###  Create a container image Lambda function [#create-container-image]

1. Choose the container image option.
2. Name your function.
3. Browse your ECR and select. 
4. Choose your architecture and create.
5. Once you create the function, add the environment variable. Below are the environment variables that you can add:

```
NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID : <NR ACCOUNT ID>
NEW_RELIC_EXTENSION_SEND_FUNCTION_LOGS : boolean value
NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED : boolean value
NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER : index.handler
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY : <NR LICENSE KEY>
NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENDPOINT : <NR LOG END POINT>
NEW_RELIC_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT : <NR TELEMETRY END POINT> 
```
6. The environment endpoints are:
    * NEW_RELIC_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT
        * Production : https://cloud-collector.newrelic.com/aws/lambda/v1
        * Eu-production : https://cloud-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/aws/lambda/v1
    * NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENDPOINT
        *Production : https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1
        * Eu-production : https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1
7. Now, add a CMD handler that based on your language. To learn more, see our [Lambda instrumentation documentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/instrument-your-own/)
