## The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack

There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring:

1. Your function
2. The New Relic agent or SDK
3. The New Relic Lambda Extension
4. New Relic's back end
5. The New Relic One Lambda UI

### Your function

Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or
how often it gets invoked.

### New Relic Agent or SDK

This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. It will wrap around
your Lambda invocation handler function, and provide considerable insight into your function, out of the box.

With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the
interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless
application.

### New Relic Lambda Extension

This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry
that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to
New Relic.

The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize
both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your
function's latency and throughput.

### New Relic's backend

The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into `AwsLambdaInvocation`, `AwsLambdaInvocationError`,
`Span`, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB.

### New Relic One

Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different
from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the
most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing
features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions.

## The legacy CloudWatch path [#cloudwatch]

Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent
writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line.

By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function, we can
recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry.

Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty
expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your
telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take
many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function.
This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear
view of application performance is most critical.
