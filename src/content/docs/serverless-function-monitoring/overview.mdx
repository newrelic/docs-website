Serverless functions are a way to run code in the cloud without worrying about managing servers. Instead of setting up and maintaining servers, the cloud provider takes care of everything for you. This means that developers can focus on writing code that responds to specific events, like a user clicking a button, without dealing with the technical details of server management.
By leveraging New Relic's serverless function monitoring capabilities, organizations can enhance their operational efficiency, improve application performance, and ensure a seamless user experience.

Following are some of the key benefits of using New Relic for serverless function monitoring:

* **Unified monitoring:** Visualize all your serverless functions in a single dashboard, regardless of the cloud provider, simplifying the management and monitoring of functions across different environments

* **Troubleshooting:** Identify and resolve issues quickly with detailed insights and analytics that help pinpoint the root cause of problems, reducing downtime and improving performance

* **Alerting:** Set up alerts to notify you of any anomalies or performance issues in real-time, ensuring that you can address potential problems before they impact your users

* **Scalability:** Scale with your application growth, providing consistent monitoring and insights without the need for additional infrastructure management
