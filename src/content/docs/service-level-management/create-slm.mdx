You can create SLIs and SLOs manually through the [New Relic UI](https://one.newrelic.com). Alternatively, you can automate the process with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-slm/) and the [Terraform Service Level resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/service_level).

## Requirements and limitations [#requirements]

To create and manage service levels requires the [capability for modifying and deleting events-to-metrics](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities#insights).

For New Relic organizations that have [multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure): Service levels can only be associated with a single account. If you're trying to create a service level for a workload with entities across multiple accounts, you may want to restructure the workloads so that all of their associated entities are in the same account.

New Relic ingests data in many different ways and from very different sources. Each has its own individual flavor, creating many possibilities on how data is consumed. There are some scenarios where it is impossible to configure service levels due to the characteristics of the data:

- **Subqueries**. Subqueries are not supported.
- **Addition of sum functions**. While it's possible to use `SELECT sum(attributeA)` or `SELECT sum(attributeA + attributeB)`, the expression `SELECT sum(attributeA) + sum(attributeB)` is not supported.

## Key concepts for creating SLIs and SLOs [#key-concepts]

Keep in mind these concepts when defining SLIs and SLOs.

### Define your key user experiences [#define-user-exp]

Start thinking of the key user experiences you or your team own at the highest level possible and zoom in until more granularity doesn't provide value. When choosing which SLs to start with, we recommend using a top-down approach, meaning start with the least granular ones, and create more granular ones only if necessary.

First of all, identify a "system boundary". This is a part of your system your users perceive as a "black box" of functionality:
- in the case of an API, it could be just a service
- for a data pipeline, it could be a chain of services necessary to process data end-to-end

Once you have established these top-level service levels, you might find that not all the endpoints of your service behave in the same way, and might want to split it further. For example:
- login transactions might need higher SLO on errors than browsing one
- duration of some operation is much higher than the rest 

For example, zooming out, a key user experience at New Relic could be: *a customer sends us telemetry data and that data is later available to be queried in our product API or UI.*

For that user experience, we could create an SLO like:

| period       | target | category | indicator                                                           |
|--------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| last 28 days | 99.9%  | latency  | data ingested by a user is available to query in less than 1 minute |

Note, these kinds of user experiences typically involve more than one service and are spread across multiple team and org boundaries. 

Zooming in, another key user experience at New Relic could be: *a customer can use the Dashboards product to visualize their telemetry data.*

This SLO could look like:

| period       | target | category     | indicator                                         |
|--------------|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| last 28 days | 99.9%  | availability | user interacts successfully with the Dashboard UI |

Zooming in too far, adding a chart widget in a Dashboard is also a user experience. However, creating a specific SLO for this action doesn't provide additional value compared to the previous SLO about users sucessfully interacting with the Dashboard UI.

In summary, use a top-down approach and start with the least granular service levels. Create more granular service levels only if necessary.

First of all, identify a "system boundary", what part of your system your user percevies as a "black box" of functionality:
- in the case of an API, it could be just a service
- for the UI it's a group of nerdlets (a nerdpack) that provide some functionality
- for the data pipeline, it could be a chain of services necessary to process data end-to-end

Once you have established the "top level SLs", you might find out that not all the endpoints of your service behave in the same way, and might want to split it further. The examples would be:
- login transactions might need higher SLO on errors than browsing one
- duration of some operation is much higher than the rest

### The related entity [#sli-entity]

In the New Relic ecosystem, every service level is linked to another [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), which is any element in your stack that reports data to us, or that generates data that we have access to. The entity that a service level is related to determines where the SLI/SLO results show.

You can define SLIs on any NRDB event or dimensional metric that is reported to New Relic. Most custom events are not related to a single New Relic entity, but provide higher level business and user experience insights. In this case, you can still relate the SLI to a specific entity or to a workload.


### SLI queries [#sli-queries]

SLIs are defined as the percentage of good responses out of the total number of valid requests. Most often you’ll set up your SLIs by defining the valid and good pieces:

* A **valid request** is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs (for example, all transactions related to an endpoint that weren’t initiated by a health check).
* A **good response** is any response that you consider to provide a good output for the end-user or client service (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user).

Alternatively, you can define what you consider to be the bad responses instead:

* A **bad response** is any response that you consider to provide a bad output (for example, the service responded with a server error, causing the client to fail its flow). New Relic will automatically derive the count of good responses as `valid - bad`.

Request-based SLOs are based on an SLI defined as the ratio of the number of good requests to the total number of requests. A request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the target for the compliance period.

## Suggested SLIs [#suggested-sli]

In this section you’ll find some SLIs that are typically used to measure the performance of services and browser applications. 

### SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent [#sli-apm]

Based on `Transaction` events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services:


<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="service-availability"
    title="Service success"
  >
    Service success is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Transaction
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Bad events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: TransactionError
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error.expected IS FALSE
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="service-latency"
    title="Service latency"
  >
    A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience.

    In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance.

    To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI:

    ```sql
    SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max
    ```

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Transaction
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web'
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Good events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Transaction
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web' AND duration < {duration}
    ```

    * Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
    * Where `{duration}` is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### SLIs for APM services instrumented with OpenTelemetry [#sli-otel]

Based on OpenTelemetry spans, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="otel-availability"
    title="Service success"
  >
    Service success is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Span
    WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer'))
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Bad events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Span
    WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND otel.status_code = 'ERROR'
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="otel-latency"
    title="Service latency"
  >
    A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience.

    In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance.

    To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI:

    ```sql
    SELECT percentile(duration.ms, 95) FROM Span WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX
    ```

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Span
    WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer'))
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Good events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: Span
    WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND duration.ms < {duration}
    ```

    * Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
    * Where `{duration}` is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds.

### SLIs for browser applications [#sli-browser]

The following SLIs are based on Google's Browser Core Web Vitals.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="browser-availability"
    title="Browser app success"
  >
    It's the proportion of page views that are served without errors.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageView
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Bad events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: JavaScriptError
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstErrorInSession IS true
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="browser-contentful-paint"
    title="Browser app largest contentful paint"
  >
    It’s the proportion of valid page views where the largest content element visible in the viewport was rendered faster than the threshold considered to correspond to a good experience.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND largestContentfulPaint IS NOT NULL
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Good events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND largestContentfulPaint < '{largestContentfulPaint}'
    ```

    * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
    * Where `{largestContentfulPaint}` is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to render the largest content element visible in the viewport that you consider provides a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 4000 ms.

      To determine a realistic number to use for `{largestContentfulPaint}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder:

      ```sql
      SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="browser-first-delay"
    title="Browser app first input delay"
  >
    It’s the proportion of page views where the time between a user's first interacion with the page and the time when the browser responds to that interaction is less than a certain threshold.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstInputDelay IS NOT NULL
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    **Good events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstInputDelay < {firstInputDelay}
    ```

    * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
    * Where `{firstInputDelay}` is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the browser should respond in to provide a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 300 ms.

      To determine a realistic number to use for `{firstInputDelay}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder:

      ```sql
      SELECT percentile(firstInputDelay, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX FACET deviceType
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="browser-cumulative-shift"
    title="Browser app cumulative layout shift"
  >
    It’s the proportion of page views with a good cumulative layout shift (CLS). CLS is described as the total sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next.

    **Valid events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND cumulativeLayoutShift IS NOT NULL
    ```

    Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

    If you’d like to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately, add one of these clauses at the end of the field:

    * `and deviceType = 'Mobile'`
    * `and deviceType = 'Desktop'`

    **Good events fields**

    ```sql
    FROM: PageViewTiming
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND cumulativeLayoutShift < {cumulativeLayoutShift}
    ```

    * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
    * Where `{cumulativeLayoutShift}` is a pre-set value. To provide a good user experience, your site should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. A CLS score of 0.25 or more is considered a poor user experience.

      If you’ve decided to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately when you defined the valid events query, add this clause at the end of the field:

      * `and deviceType = 'Mobile'`
      * `and deviceType = 'Desktop'`

      To determine a realistic number to select for `{cumulativeLayoutShift}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 75th percentile of page loads for the last 7 or 15 days, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. Find it by using the query builder:

      ```sql  
      SELECT percentile(cumulativeLayoutShift, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE  entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Create and edit service levels [#create-edit]

You can create SLIs and SLOs from several places on [in our UI](https://one.newrelic.com):

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Service levels**. You can associate the SLI with any entity across your accounts, including workloads.
* From the **Service levels** page in any APM Service, Browser application, or Synthetic monitor. The SLI will be associated with that specific entity.  If you use this starting point, New Relic will automatically create the most common service level indicators for this entity type, based on the latest available data.
* From the **Service levels** tab in any workload. You can associate the SLI with any entity in the workload, or the whole workload. 

Remember that service levels can only be associated with a single account. For details on that, see [the requirements](#requirements).

To create service levels, follow these steps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="select-sli-source"
    title="Select the SLI data source"
  >
    In order to define your new SLI, choose one of these two options:

    * **Entity data**: Base the SLI on standard data coming from our agents or your own custom events. This is the most common option. If this is your choice, select the entity (for example, APM service) you want to use.
    * **Custom data**: Alternatively, you can base the SLI on your custom NRDB events or dimensional metrics. Use this option when you can't relate the service level data to a specific entity, or when you want to relate the service level directly to a workload.
    * **Metric data**: Based on the data coming from Prometheus, OTel or your own custom dimensional metrics.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-queries"
    title="Configure the queries"
  >
    In this step, you'll configure the SLI queries that determine which event is valid, or good, or bad.

    If you associate the SLI with an APM service or a browser app, New Relic will suggest some typical SLI and their queries. We'll use the latest data as a baseline for your service level objectives, and you will be able to edit the SLI and SLO afterwards.

    <img
      title="Suggested service levels"
      alt="Suggested service levels"
      src={slmAddServiceLevelExample}
    />

   If you're using a different type of entity, you want to query dimensional metrics, or you want to customize the baseline values provided by New Relic, you can customize the SLI to your needs. For instance, you can use the `WHERE` clause to filter out health checks. You could also use different event types on each queries; in this case, make sure that each valid event corresponds only to one or less events on the good or bad query.

    <img
      title="Custom service level"
      alt="Custom service level"
      src={slmEditServiceLevelExample}
    />

    The account where the data is gathered from matches the account of the entity that the SLI refers to. Please see the section above to know what goes into each field.

    On the right you'll see the final queries, and at the bottom you'll get a preview of the number of valid and good/bad events in the last days.

    <Callout variant="important">
      At the moment, there are two aggregation functions supported: `count()` and `sum()`. You can find more information in our [FAQs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/service-level-management/faqs-slm) page.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="set-slo"
    title="Set the SLO time window and target"
  >
    In this step you'll get a preview of the SLI value, and you'll add one SLO for this SLI: Just select the length of the time window and the percentage target. The chart on the right will help you anticipate whether the target you're setting is feasible or if it's often missed.

    Rolling time-window SLOs are supported. With a rolling time-window, the SLO compliance takes into account the last N days. Every minute, the oldest data drops out of the current calculation and new data replaces it.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="define-sli"
    title="Name and tag your SLI"
  >
    Select a short name for your SLI which helps you recognize what it's measuring.

    We recommend that you add tags to your SLI, so you can later use them for searching, filtering, and grouping SLIs on the UI.

    You can set any tag that's meaningful to your organization. A dropdown will suggest useful tag keys such as the following:

    * `owner`: The team or business unit that owns this service level, and will react when the SLO target is missed.
    * `category`: A keyword that describes what the SLI is measuring, such as `latency`. If you follow the suggested service level flow, New Relic will populate this tag for you, and you may later edit it.
    * `environment`: The environment that the service level is measuring, and that makes sense to your use case.
    * `maturity`: Useful to communicate to your stakeholders how stable the SLO is. We recommend that you use tag values such as `test`, `commitment`, or `aspirational`.
    * `user_journey` and `application`: These kinds of tags help you group the SLIs that apply to the same user experience, whether it's a whole user journey, or just a specific application.

      Additionally, the dropdown also displays the related entity tags, so you can quickly add them to the SLI as well.

      <img
        title="Service level tags"
        alt="Service level tags"
        src={slmTagExamples}
      />

      To finish, you may optionally add a description for that service level.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Edit SLIs [#edit-sli]

Once you've created an SLI, you can edit it through the service levels list page, by clicking on the **...** menu and then `Edit`, as shown here: 

<img
  title="Edit SLIs"
  alt="Edit SLIs"
  src={slmEditMenuOption}
/>

or you can do that same thing through the summary page, by clicking `Edit`: 

    
<img
  title="Edit SLIs summary page"
  alt="Edit SLIs summary page"
  src={slmSummaryEditButton}
/>
