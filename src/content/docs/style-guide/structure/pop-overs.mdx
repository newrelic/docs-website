title: Pop-overs
---

Pop-overs provide a lot of direction in a small space for our readers. Popovers give quick inline definitions of key concepts, and provide a path to learn more in the docs or try it out in the UI.

## Using pop-overs [#use-pop]

A pop-over is written in a [JSON file](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/popovers_en.json), and can be put into any doc you like using the following format:

```jsx
<InlinePopover type="title" />
```

Where `title` is the name of the component in the JSON file. In the screenshot above, `synthetics` is the pop-over used.

  The Keyboard Maestro macro for pop-overs is `kkpopover`

## Creating or editing pop-overs

Pop-overs are contained within an editable JSON file. You can edit the file to create your own pop-overs using the procedure below:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the [JSON file](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/popovers_en.json) in VS Code.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Copy and paste an existing pop-over, and modify it as needed for the pop-over you want to create.

    * The first line is the "title" of the pop-over used in the format example above.
    * `inlineText` is the text that appears in the doc you put the component in, before the user hovers over the pop-over.
    * `header` is the title of the pop-over once it displays.
    * `text` is the copy that displays in the body of the pop-over.
    * `learnMoreUrl` is the URL of the doc you want to send the reader to for more information.
    * `primaryButton` is the text of the main button as it appears in the pop-over.
    * `primaryButtonUrl` is the link you want the button to send the reader to when clicked.
    * `secondaryButton` is the text of the right-most button as it appears in the pop-over.
    * `secondaryButtonUrl` is the link you want the right-most button to send the reader to when clicked.

      Keep the list in the JSON file in alphabetical order to make things easier to find.
