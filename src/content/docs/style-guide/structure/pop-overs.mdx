Pop-overs are a unique component we've created to provide a lot of direction in a small space for our readers. Initially created to help with VSUs, you can use these components to help get readers into the product, go to a document that gives them more information on a subject, or even sign up for New Relic, all in one place!

## Using pop-overs [#use-pop]

A pop-over is written in a [JSON file](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/popovers_en.json), and can be put into any doc you like using the following format:

```
<InlinePopover type="title" />
```

Where "title" is the name of the component in the JSON file. In the screenshot above, "synthetics" is the pop-over used, so "synthetics" goes where "title" is in the component. 

You can use multiple pop-overs in a single topic without any issues.

The keyboard maestro macro for pop-overs is `kkpopover`

## Creating or editing pop-overs

As mentioned above, the pop-overs are contained within an editable JSON file. You can edit the file to create your own pop-overs using the procedure below:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Open the [JSON file](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/popovers_en.json) and opening your preferred editor.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Copy and paste an existing pop-over, and modify it as needed for the pop-over you want to create. 
        * The first line is the "title" of the pop-over used in the format example above.
        * `inlineText` is the text that appears in the doc you put the component in, before the user hovers over the pop-over.
        * `header` is the title of the pop-over once it displays.
        * `text` is the copy that displays in the body of the pop-over.
        * `learnMoreUrl` is the URL of the doc you want to send the reader to for more information.
        * `primaryButton` is the text of the main button as it appears in the pop-over.
        * `primaryButtonUrl` is the link you want the button to send the reader to when clicked.
        * `secondaryButton` is the text of the right-most button as it appears in the pop-over.
        * `secondaryButtonUrl` is the link you want the right-most button to send the reader to when clicked.
    
    For organizational purposes, we try to keep the list in the JSON file in order to make things easier to find.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Ensure that the formatting of your pop-over is correct, as well as the formatting of the brackets that surround it.

    <Step>
    Open a PR based on your changes, and contact someone in DevEng to have them review.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Once the PR is reviewed and merged, you can use your new pop-over in any doc you like!
