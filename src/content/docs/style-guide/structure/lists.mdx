Lists are a powerful way to organize information, but they do not always make for a pleasant reading experience. Keep these points in mind when you're writing a list: 

* Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item.
* Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters.
* Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information.
* Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point.
* Use tables when your ordered or unordered list would benefit from some extra detail.

Here's an example of an ordered list as a table. Because each step is a row, the table helps to structure the levels of detail.

## In-line lists [#inline-lists]

As an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: [C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications) \| [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/distributed-tracing-go#create-manually) \| [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/api-guides/guide-using-java-agent-api#trace-calls).

You might want to use an in-line list when:

* You're linking to further documentation.
* Customers will likely be selecting a single option.
* The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure).
* You think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space. This may happen in circumstances where a procedure must include several lists. Here's [one example of this](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#enable).
* There are only two or three potential options they'll be choosing from and a bullet point list seems unnecessary. Here's [an example](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/introduction-net-agent-install#requiremnts).
