The `step` component lets you create defined procedures with more structure than ordered lists. Use `step` when you have a large procedure that would benefit from dedicated space ordered lists don't offer. 

## Syntax [#syntax]

There are three things to note when using the step component:

* All step procedures begin with `<Steps>` and are closed with `</Steps>`
* Each individual step begins with `<Step>` and is closed with `</Step>`

The Keyboard Maestro macro for the step component is `kkstepgroup`.

## Example

This is the syntax for a doc with the step component. Below that you can see the step procedure in action:

How to grind coffee:

<Steps>

<Step>
First find some fresh beans. The older the beans, the worse your grind will end up.
</Step>

<Step>
Pour a drop of water on your (clean) finger and then wiggle it around in your beans. This reduces the amount of static and reduces grind retention in your grinder.

</Step>

<Step>
Take your ever so slightly moist beans and put them in your grinder. We recommend you use a modern burr grinder and avoid blade grinders.
</Step>

<Step>
Select your grind size. Your grind size depends on how you will brew your coffee. Pour-overs require a fine grind and french presses require a course grind.
</Step>

<Step>
Turn your grinder on and enjoy!
</Step>
