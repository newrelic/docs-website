Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does.

Use your callouts judiciously. **Recommendation:** Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed.

## Types of callouts [#classes]

We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the `variant` you include in the `<Callout>` tag.

Here's an example of the format for a tip callout:

```jsx
<Callout variant="tip">
  Your tip text goes here.

  It can have multiple paragraphs.
</Callout>
```

Here are examples of our callout variants:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="tr-caution"
    title="Caution"
  >
    **Cautions** scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use `<Callout variant="caution">`. At a traffic light, a **Caution** would be red.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-important"
    title="Important"
  >
    **Important** notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use `<Callout variant="important">`. At a traffic light, an **Important** note would be yellow.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high-security mode.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-tip"
    title="Tip"
  >
    **Tips** whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use `<Callout variant="tip">`. At a traffic light, a **Tip** would be a green light.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-permissions"
    title="User-related permissions"
  >
    For recommended wording, see [User-related language and styles](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/user-related-language-styles-recommended-phrasings).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-custom-callout"
    title="Custom callouts"
  >
    Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as preview docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts:

    * **Title text:** Change the callout label by inserting the `title` attribute like this: `title="YOUR CUSTOM TITLE"`. When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters.
    * **Color:** The color is limited to the color of the `variant` you include, or if you don't include a `variant`, you get the default border color (blue-grey).

      Here is what the code looks like:

      ```jsx
      <Callout variant="caution" title="YOUR CUSTOM TITLE">
        Your callout message goes here!
      </Callout>
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Avoid callout fatigue [#fatigue]

Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts.

Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts:

* **If you add a callout, remove a callout.** Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts.
* **Do not use stacked callouts.** Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up.
* **Remove outdated callouts.** As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc.
* **Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts.** If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness.

### Stacked callouts example [#stacked]

Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important">
  Not everything is important enough to put in a callout.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution">
  Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.
</Callout>

## Preview doc callouts [#preview-callouts]

For preview docs, add a custom callout using the default color:

<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
</Callout>

After the first line, and depending on where the preview callout will be published, remember to include this required default message:

* **For public previews on `docs.newrelic.com`**: You must also include this standard message in the callout at the top of each preview page.

  <Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
  </Callout>

* **For preview features only available on our private beta site**: You must also include this standard message in the callout at the top of each preview page.

  <Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
