The `SideBySide` component lets you split the screen in half, or more sections. A common use case is to show a screenshot in the right column, and accompanying text on the left.

You need to wrap the content for each side inside a `Side` component, but you can add as much content as you need inside each `Side`.

Technically the component supports more than two `Side` columns, but you should avoid using more than two.

Here's an example of the component:

<SideBySide>
  <Side>
    <img
      alt="example"
      src="/images/network_screenshot-full_device-performance.webp"
    />

    <figcaption>
      Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Network**
    </figcaption>
  </Side>

  <Side>
