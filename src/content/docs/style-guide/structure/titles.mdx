This doc explains the difference between Titles and Short titles. It also delves into how these are affected and affect Paths and Redirects.

## Titles

Titles are the title rendered at the top of each doc. The title of this doc is **Titles, short titles, and paths**.

The title of a document is defined in the front matter. This doc's title is defined below:

```yaml
title: Titles, short titles, and paths
```

## Short titles

Short titles are displayed in the left nav. These are used in cases where the title is a bit too long to be easily scanned. The short title of this doc is **Titles and short titles**.

The short title is defined in the corresponding navigation file. This doc's short title is defined in `src/content/nav/style-guide.yml`:

```yaml
- title: Titles and short titles
  path: /docs/style-guide/structure/titles
```

## Paths and redirects

The path and file name of a specific doc has no bearing on the title of that doc. The path for this doc is `/docs/style-guide/structure/titles`. Notice that although the file is named `titles`, neither the title or the short title is called `Titles`.

Redirects fully ignore the title, short title, and path of a doc. It will redirect you to wherever the redirect points. [Read more about redirects](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document).
