Tables help you organize information to make it easier for readers to skim. However, if your table becomes too long, follow the ["five to nine" guideline](/docs/style-guide/get-started/introduction-style-guide#organization) and consider restructuring the information in other ways.

Use sentence case for text in every table column unless it's a specific file name or code value that requires lower case or all caps.

## Table syntax

Our tables are built as MDX React components. In practice, they're quite similar to HTML tables:

```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Item**
            </th>
            <th>
            **Description**
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
            Item name
            </td>
            <td>
            Description of item
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

  The docs site technically supports [Markdown tables](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables), but we avoid using them for a few reasons:

  * There are multiple flavors of Markdown, and different flavors use different table syntaxes. This is because John Gruber's original Markdown spec did not include tables.
  * Markdown tables don't support elements that span multiple lines, and most of our tables include code blocks, bulleted lists, or other elements that require multiple lines.

## Setting column width [#column-width]

You can set column width with a style rule on the `<th>` element:

```html
<th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
```

In general, for two-column tables on the docs site:

1. Set the first column as 200 pixels: `style={{ width: "200px" }}`.
2. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column.

## Tables to describe UI functions [#tables-ui]

When using tables to describe available functions, give readers a roadmap. They may know what they want to find or accomplish, but they may not know what it's called or how to do it.

For example, to provide a list of features for a particular UI page, label the header's first column **If you want to...** and label the second column **Do this**.
