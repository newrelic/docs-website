Sometimes, content inside of a doc needs to be presented to the reader in a specific way. Maybe it's an important piece of information that needs to be emphasized. Maybe it's a lot of information that may not be relevant to everyone that can be safely compressed unless it's needed. Or maybe it's a need that hasn't been met yet that you want to talk to engineering about creating. That's where components come in.

We use a wide variety of components across the doc site, and have topics on them in this section of the style guide. For quick reference, the components we have information on are:

* [Collapsers](/docs/style-guide/structure/collapsers/)
* [Lists](/docs/style-guide/structure/lists/)
* [Pop-overs](/docs/style-guide/structure/pop-overs)
* [Side-by-side](/docs/style-guide/structure/side-by-side/)
* [Steps](/docs/style-guide/structure/steps/)
* [Tables](/docs/style-guide/structure/tables/)
* Tabs
* Tiles
