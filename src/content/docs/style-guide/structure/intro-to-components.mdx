Sometimes, content inside of a doc needs to be presented to the reader in a specific way. Maybe it's an important piece of information that needs to be emphasized. Maybe it's a lot of information that may not be relevant to everyone that can be safely compressed unless it's needed. Or maybe it's a need that hasn't been met yet that you want to talk to engineering about creating. That's where components come in.

We use a wide variety of components across the doc site, and have topics on them in this section of the style guide. For quick reference, the components, as well as their keyboard maestro macros, are:

* [Collapsers](/docs/style-guide/structure/collapsers/) (`kkcollapse1` or `kkclamgroup`)
* [Lists](/docs/style-guide/structure/lists/) 
* [Pop-overs](/docs/style-guide/structure/pop-overs) (`kkpopover`)
* [Side-by-side](/docs/style-guide/structure/side-by-side/) (`kkside`)
* [Steps](/docs/style-guide/structure/steps/) (`kkstepgroup`)
* [Tables](/docs/style-guide/structure/tables/) (`kktable`)
* [Tabs](/docs/style-guide/structure/tabs) (`kktabgroup`)
* [Tiles](/docs/style-guide/structure/tiles) (`kktilegroup`)
