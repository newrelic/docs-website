For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines:

* We generally follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style.
* We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones.
* We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see [aws.amazon.com/products](https://aws.amazon.com/products/).)
* For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the [product glossary](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="account-id"
    title="account ID"
  >
    A unique number that [identifies a particular New Relic account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id). Don't use `account number`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agent"
    title="agent"
  >
    For the definition of agent, see [the glossary](/docs/glossary/glossary/#agent).

    Style guidelines:

    * Don't capitalize: use `the Ruby agent`, not `the Ruby Agent`.
    * Don't refer to a synthetics [`private minion`](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions) as an `agent`.
    * How `agents` relate to `integrations`: an `integration` is a connection between technologies. New Relic provides many types of integrations, which are linkages between various technologies and our platform. And some of those integrations require no additional software: for example, some of our integrations just require changing a setting in a service to send data to New Relic, or changing an endpoint to send data to New Relic. Agents, on the other hand, are pieces of software that enable one or more integrations. For example, our APM agents have integrations with various app frameworks and web servers and types of databases. One way to frame this is: "The integrations included with our agents are just some of [our many integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability)" or "Our agent-based integrations..."

    * Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm.
    * Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am).
    * Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10.

  <Collapser
    id="aws"
    title="Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names"
  >
    Refer to the specific product, not just `AWS` broadly.

    * As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. **Example:** `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud`.
    * After that, use the short name according to the [AWS Documentation site](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). **Example:** `Amazon EC2`.

  <Collapser
    id="ampersand-details"
    title="ampersand (&)"
  >
    Don’t use ampersands in sentences or headings, unless they’re part of a company or brand name. Exception: If space is tight (meaning, “and” does not fit), it’s acceptable to use an ampersand.
  </Collapser>
    
  <Collapser
    id="app-name"
    title="app name vs. app alias"

  >
    When describing how one entity communicates or is connected to another, focus on the calls and which direction they’re going. For example, “service A calls service B,” “called services,” “calling services.”

    Avoid using "upstream" and "downstream" to describe this.

    This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see:

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="click"
    title="click"
  >
    In general, use `click` rather than the vaguer `select`. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list.

    Be particularly careful to use `click` to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a `right click` or a `click and drag`. Also use `click` when the user must click on a non-selectable object (`to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box`). See also [mouse over](#mouse-over).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collector"
    title="collector vs. connect to New Relic"
  >
    When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector). Although internally the `collector` refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean "any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product." Avoid "connect to New Relic," and do not use "connect to the New Relic UI."
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="contractions"
    title="contractions"
  >
    When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority.

    There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, `it's` for `it is` is fine, but less common constructions like `mustn't` or `wouldn't've` are best avoided.

    Also:

    * When using a negative contraction (`don't`, `can't`, `won't`) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the [style guide intro](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/introduction-style-guide#tone) for more on this.)
    * There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out `do not`, `cannot`, or `will not` is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="customer-vs-user"
    title="customer vs. user"
  >
    When possible, use the second person `you` to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind:

    * `customer` and `user` are both appropriate depending on context.
    * `customer` makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s).
    * `user` makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboard"
    title="dashboard"
  >
From a general industry standpoint, `dashboard` usually refers to one or more charts or other widgets on a screen. You can see this general definition in the [Wikipedia entry for dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)).  

At New Relic, we use the term `dashboard` a couple different ways:

* Dashboards refer to a New Relic feature called `New Relic dashboards`, as seen on [its feature page](https://newrelic.com/platform/dashboards). In this context, `New Relic dashboards` refers to the ability to create and use customized views that are not built into our core platform experiences (for example, the UI for APM, browser monitoring, OpenTelemetry, and others). These custom dashboards are found on the **Dashboards** UI page. 
* Dashboards can also refer to curated dashboards. These dashboards are default views that customers get when they use our core platform solutions (for example, the UI experiences for APM, infrastructure, and browser monitoring). 

Our customized dashboards include dashboards found in [New Relic apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks/), and in quickstarts on our [Instant Observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability). For example, if you look at [the .NET quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/dotnet), you see that it comes with one extra dashboard that is not part of our curated experience. 

If you think there's ambiguity when using the general term 'dashboard', then we recommend the following usage:

* To refer to custom experiences found in nerdpacks, quickstarts, or dashboards made by a customer or their team, use `custom dashboards`, or `customizable dashboards`, or `quickstart dashboards`. 
* To refer to our more curated views, use `curated views`, `curated dashboards`, `New Relic-built dashboards`, `APM dashboards`, `APM views` (to give a few ideas). 

Really, we recommend being as specific as possible to establish context. If a piece of writing has established that context once, then feel free to use the general `dashboard`.

  <Collapser
    id="data-sheet"
    title="data sheet"
  >
    When referring to a data sheet, separate into two words so it reads `data sheet` and not `datasheet`. 
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="DevOps"
    title="DevOps"
  >
    Short for software developers and operations.
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="document"
    title="doc, document, documentation, docs site"
  >
    If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, `See [Install the .NET agent](URL)` rather than `See our [.NET agent install docs](URL)`.

    If there's not a good alternative, `doc` generally sounds more natural than `document` or `documentation`. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best.

    If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the `docs site` rather than `Docs site` or `documentation site`. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL `docs.newrelic.com` to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to [our docs GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website), use the repo name `docs-website` or the repo path `newrelic/docs-website`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="downstream-upstream"
    title="downstream and upstream"
  >
    Don't use to describe how entities relate to each other. How people interpret downstream and upstream varies significantly, so focus on the specific type of connection as we do in the related entities element: calls, creates, hosts, maintains, etc.

    Examples:
    `[Service A] calls [service B]`
    `Called services`
    `Calling services`
    `maintained by [repository name]`
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dropdown"
    title="dropdown"
  >
    Use `dropdown` instead of `drop-down` or `drop down`.

    Although it isn't common usage, you can use `dropdown` independently as a noun, without needing to say `dropdown menu` or `dropdown list`. For example, `select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="eg"
    title="e.g. and i.e."
  >
    Avoid these Latin abbreviations.

    Instead of `e.g.`, use `for example` or `such as`. Subbing for `i.e.` is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean `that is`, while at other times it's mis-used to mean `for example`. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="em-dash"
    title={<>em dash (<InlineCode>—</InlineCode>)</>}
  >
    Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice.

    If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example:

    ```
    You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number.
    ```

    You can insert an em dash with the `COMMAND+OPTION+-` shortcut or [use the HTML entity](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Common_HTML_entities_used_for_typography).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="etc"
    title="etc."
  >
    Unlike the Latin abbreviations [`e.g.`](#eg) or [`i.e.`](#ie), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (`etc.`). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, `cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc.` but not `cities including Portland, etc.`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="event"
    title="event"
  >
    To understand how to optimally write about events, we recommend reading:

    * The [event section in the data types doc](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data)

    * [The glossary entry for "event"](/docs/glossary/glossary/#event)

      Some language-related considerations when writing about events:

    * It's important to understand some of the ambiguity and history around how we sometimes use the word "event." Prior to the roll-out of our three other core data types of `Metric`, `Log`, and `Span`, at New Relic we referred to all NRDB-stored objects as "events." For this reason, internally and sometimes externally we still sometimes refer to all NRDB objects as "events." (For example, in [the query UI](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#inspected-count-limits), we still use "events inspected" and this refers to all NRDB data types). But for public-facing resources, we should attempt to use "event" to refer to NRDB-stored data **that is not** `Metric`, `Log`, or `Span` data types.

    * It's important to understand how the concept of "event" can overlap with the concept of "metric." Both are broad general terms and due to that there can be some overlap in meaning. Because metrics are just measurements, all New Relic data (events, spans, logs) can be said to be or contain metrics. For example, the events reported by our infrastructure monitoring contain various metrics, which are simply numeric measurements of various kinds ([read more about infrastructure events containing metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metric-event-attributes)).

    When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word `icon`.

    For example, `select the delete` `icon`.

    Don't put icons in bold.

    When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example:

    * Yes: Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
      icon.
    * No: Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
      icon.

    Some tips about some often confusing aspects of metric data:

    * Note that the word "metrics" is a broad, general concept and at New Relic we have [a number of data types and data-reporting methods that are called "metrics"](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics-new-relic).

    * The best metric data format is dimensional metric data, aka the `Metric` data type. That data is reported via the Metric API. This is the "metric" data that we are primarily referring to when we talk about the "metrics" in our four core "MELT" data types: metrics, events, logs, and traces.

    * Our original metric data format is called metric timeslice data. This is still reported by APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. This was a very simple form of metric data and was not stored in NRDB, so it could not be queried in NRQL. Currently APM metric timeslice data is mirrored in NRDB and so [can be queried via NRQL](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-apm-metric-timeslice-data-nrql).

      Some style-related recommendations:

    * **Err on the side of talking about "metrics" generally and not going into detail about the data structure and reporting process**. In general, whether talking about dimensional metrics (the `Metric` data type) or metric timeslice data or metrics reported as infrastructure event attributes, you can simply use "metrics" or "metric data." It's thought that in most cases in docs and UI, a customer won't often need to know exactly what type of data it is. But if it's thought that it would be helpful to know the type of data (for example, when talking about how to query that data), you can give more detail about the type of data.

    * When you want to clarify the type of metric data in a simple way, you can link to a specific metric data type collapser in [this section](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics-new-relic). For example, you might do something like this: "This integration reports [metric data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics)."

    id="node-js"
    title="Node.js and nodes"
  >
    We generally refer to the programming language as `Node.js`, not `Node`. For example, `Node.js agent` not `Node agent`. 
    
    Be careful, though, because unfortunately, the Node.js community is wildly inconsistent on this point. There are two key tools whose unabbreviated names say `Node` instead of `Node.js`: `nvm` stands for `Node Version Manager`, and `npm` stands for `Node Package Manager`. On the rare occasions you need to expand the acronym, follow the official naming.

    Note also that `node` itself is a wildly overloaded term in computing, so that for example Kubernetes has `nodes` that have nothing to do with the programming language.

  <Collapser
    id="version"
    title="version number references"
  >
    When referring to multiple version numbers, use `or higher` or `or lower`. Don't use `and higher` (it's more ambiguous than `or`), or the words `greater` or `later`. Also don't use punctuation, as in `version 1.2+` or `<version 1.2`. Avoid `1.2.X` style references, and instead use the exact version numbers. For example:

    ```
    Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher
    ```

    ```
    Bar is compatible with ActiveMerchant version 4.5.6 or lower
    ```

    You'll find that both `version` and `versions` work depending on the context; try reading it aloud if you're unsure. 

    Other usage notes:

    * Tell users to use the `latest version` and not an `up-to-date` or `current` version.
    * To abbreviate the word `version`, use a lowercase `v` with no space before the number; for example, `v2` or `v1.2.3`.
    * Use `update` not `upgrade` when talking about agent versions, as in "To update to the latest version..."
    * Consider using `in earlier agent versions` when referring to versions more vaguely.

    id="we"
    title="we"

    Say `we` and `our` when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with `New Relic` mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this:

    ```
    New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout.
    ```

    Instead, write something like this:

    ```
    Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration.
    ```

    OR

    ```
    We recommend setting a startup timeout.

    We use `you` and `your` liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.
