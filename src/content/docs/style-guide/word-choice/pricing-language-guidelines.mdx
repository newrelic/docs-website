This doc explains required styles and recommended phrasings for pricing-related requirements.

## Explanations of philosophy

If you haven't already, please read [Overview of pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model) to understand our two different pricing models. Understanding that we have two different pricing models is an important first step of understanding our guidelines around pricing-related language. 

Here are some details about our strategies for how and where we document some billing-related aspects:

* We explain billing impacts in the main pricing and billing-related docs. The main docs for this are: 
    * [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/)
    * [Original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing)
* User-related billing impacts: for the New Relic One pricing model, user type is a billing factor. For details about language related to user permissions, see [User-related style guidelines](/docs/style-guide/word-choice/user-related-language-guidelines).
* Data ingest-related billing impacts: for the New Relic One pricing model, data ingest is a billing factor. As a general rule, we don't talk about ingest-related billing impacts in feature-related docs and instead talk generally about impacts to data generation and ingest (for example, as we do [in this doc](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/manage-pixie-data)). But any talk about about cost/billing impacts should be constrained to the [New Relic One pricing model doc](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing) and our [Manage data ingest doc](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic/#adjust-ingest).  
* When a feature requires a pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise), we include that in the requirements of the doc for that feature. There are only a few capabilities for which edition is a restraining factors, so this is an infrequent need. 
* Our [license docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses) (such as [this one](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions)): these docs are primarily written by legal- and agreement-focused teams, not the docs team.

## Style and formatting [#style-format]

Here are some important pricing-related language guidelines: 

* Pricing models: 
    * Use the word "model" to refer to our two pricing models: the New Relic One pricing model, and our original pricing model. 
    * Examples of referring to models: 
        * *If you're on our New Relic One pricing model...*
        * *If you're on our original pricing model...*
    * When referencing a model, it's good practice to point to either the doc for that model, or else the [doc explaining the differences between the models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-user-table), whichever makes more sense. 
* "usage-based." The New Relic One pricing model can be referred to as “usage-based” or “consumption-based,” but “usage-based” is the most commonly used and more preferred term.
* Editions:  
    * Our pricing editions are not "plans" or "models" or "tiers"; they are "editions". 
    * Our pricing editions are formatted with title case: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Example use: *If your organization is on the [Pro edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)...*
    * A New Relic organization can only have a single edition. 
    * Avoid referring to users by their edition (e.g., *your Pro users* or *Enterprise users*). The cost of billable users does differ depending on edition, but we should attempt to keep these two dimensions separate. Example wording: *an organization with Pro edition and 10 full platform users*.
    * For recommendations for how to mention the edition in feature requirements docs, see [edition guidelines](#edition-guidelines). 
* Free tier. The New Relic One pricing model has a so-called "[free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free)", but this isn't actually a separate plan or edition. It simply means that an organization is on the Standard edition but isn't yet paying money (either because they're under the free limits of usage or because they can't yet be charged because they haven't put in a credit card). 
* Usage plans: 
    * The New Relic One pricing model has two methods of paying, sometimes referred to as "usage plans": pay-as-you-go and annual pool of funds. 
    * Example use: *On the pay-as-you-go usage plan, your organization...*
    * Internally, we sometimes use acronyms for these usage plans (PAYG and APoF) but don't use those acronyms in public-facing communication.  
* Billable users. For how to reference user type, see [User-related language guidelines](/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/user-related-language-guidelines). 


## Exception for agreement- and contract-related language [#license-docs]

Our license docs ([like this one](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions)) use a different style and formatting than what we recommend above. Those docs are more legal/agreement-oriented. One different is that they use title case (for example, `the Usage Plan`) to reference agreement/contract terms they have specifically [defined](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/legacy-product-definitions). 

## Recommendations for referencing edition in requirements [#edition-guidelines]

When you document a pricing edition-related restriction, use the following approach:

* **Requirements section:** When documenting features that require the Pro or Enterprise edition, add edition requirements in a "requirements" section of the doc, with wording like: "This requires a Pro or Enterprise edition." Only add pricing-related wording for the specific features that Pro and Enterprise edition give access to; this is a fairly small set of features.
* **Pricing requirements in one section:** As a general rule, attempt to place any pricing edition requirement in a single location and avoid putting it in multiple paragraphs.
* **Original pricing model:** At this point, only add edition-related requirements for the New Relic One pricing model editions, not original pricing model editions. The original pricing model will be more and more de-emphasized over time, as more customers get on the new pricing model, so there shouldn't be much need to mention original pricing aspects or edit those docs.
