Review the recommended [best practices for New Relic release notes](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/best-practices-for-release-notes) (Internal New Relic link). Then, to add either type of release note to the site:

1. Find the most recent release note for your agent and make a copy of it.
2. Use the established filenaming convention to name the new file.
3. Fill in the **subject**, **releaseDate**, **version**, and/or **watermark** fields.
4. Write the content for your new release note, following the established pattern.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request.

A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your pull request to get it published.

If release notes are blockers for your team, please be aware that release note pull requests may take a few hours to appear on the docs site after merging.
