**This is a template.** Feel free to copy the formatting tips in this template to organize the docs you create on the Docs site. Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed.

Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether [they are in the right place](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/five-questions-help-write-docs).

## Section example [#h2_heading_example]

Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The Docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation.

If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to [security requirements](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/docs-site-security-guidelines-for-images), the Docs team manages all images on the Docs site.

## Code example [#h2_code]

```
def article_url(category, article, options={})
url_for(options.reverse_merge(
  :controller => 'articles';,
  :action => 'show',
  :category => category,
  :article => article
))
end
```

## List example [#h2_list_example]

For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (`ol` in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example:

1. Add `require('newrelic');` as the first line of your app's main module.
2. Use the command `npm install newrelic --save` for each application you want to monitor.

For unordered lists, use bullets (`ul` in HTML or `*` in Markdown). For example:

* Black
* White

For complex lists, consider using [clamshells](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/clamshells).

## Table example [#h2_tables]

Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple:

```
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Item**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Requirements**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Some thing
      </td>

      <td>
        More detailed information about it
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Another thing
      </td>

      <td>
        More detailed information about another thing
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens `---` to create each column’s header, and pipes `|` to separate each column. For example:

```
| Item       | Requirements
------------ | ------------
| Some thing | More detailed information about it
| Another thing | More detailed information about another thing
```

## Last section (For more help) [#last_section]

Always add one final section to your doc called `For more help`. A bulleted list of helpful resources is automatically generated in this section when your doc is published.

By default, the list of resources does not appear when your doc is a draft. You do not need to add anything here manually.
