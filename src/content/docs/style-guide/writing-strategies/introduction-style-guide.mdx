Welcome to New Relic's style guide. We've written these guidelines for content creators across New Relic, and for contributors to our open source content projects, like the Docs or our other New Relic GitHub repositories.

This guide is not intended to cover all usage questions. For anything not explicitly covered, we defer to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) (in particular, the "Aâ€“Z word list" and guide to [Formatting common text elements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/text-formatting/formatting-common-text-elements)) or the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) (for general writing and editing guidelines).

We follow American English conventions, though if you're creating country-specific assets you can use regional English variations. For example, a PDF targeted specifically to British customers could also follow British English conventions. If you're in doubt, use American English.
