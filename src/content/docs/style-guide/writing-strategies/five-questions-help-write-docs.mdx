Our five questions form the core of how our Tech Docs team thinks about writing excellent technical documentation. Informally, we call these our 5Qs.

Anyone can contribute to our docs site. We want you to feel confident and proud that your contributions provide valuable content and quality. We also want our readers to trust and easily use the information in our docs. To help you plan, write, and edit excellent docs, ask yourself the questions in this doc.

## There's really only 1Q [#one-q]

The 5Qs exist to help answer one question. Whenever you write a doc, ask yourself:

> What problem are we trying to solve?

It's critical you know what you're trying to do and why that goal matters to your readers. Asking the five questions (and the sub-questions!) will help you ensure you're building the right thing.

## 5Qs and sub-questions [#details]

Each of the five questions includes sub-questions to help guide your thinking.

    Think about **who** your audience is and the level of complexity they need.

          <td>
            * Do you know who is reading your document (dev/ops teams, support personnel, non-technical staff, etc.)?
            * Can you articulate what this thing is (feature, procedure) and why it matters to our customers?
            * For conceptual info, did you interview multiple stakeholders?

            Testing
          </td>

          <td>
            Put yourself in the user's shoes. For example:

            * Did you use the thing on your own?
            * Did you watch a subject matter expert use the thing?
            * If you can't do it on your own or observe, did you send the draft to at least three SMEs?

            Does this doc need to exist at all?
          </td>

          <td>
            For example:

            * Are we duplicating content from somewhere else in the docs site?
            * Are we duplicating content already in the UI?
            * Could customers have a better experience if we modified the UI design or copy instead of creating a doc?

            * Do the headings accurately represent what's in the doc?
            * Do the title and headings use words the way your readers do?
            * Do the title and headings avoid New Relic jargon?

        <tr>

            Structure
          </td>

          <td>
            * Does the overall structure of the doc help readers find what they're looking for?
            * Is the doc trying to address too many topics?
            * When you glance at the doc, do you see short paragraphs, short sentences, and other visual aids? Or do you see a dense wall of text?

          <td>
            Did you use visual formats appropriately?

            * Would a screenshot make any of the information easier to understand?
            * Does your image caption clearly explain what matters so that the user does not necessarily even need to read the surrounding text?
            * Would a diagram make any of the information easier to understand?
            * Is there a video we could embed to make things clearer? Can step-by-step UI procedures be replaced with a "show me" video?

            Procedures

          <td>
            Are your procedures well-structured?

            * Do step-by-step UI procedures even need to be documented?
            * Did you limit the procedural text to action steps and omit detailed explanatory text or edge cases?
            * If detailed explanations need to enhance a procedure, have you organized the info in a way that expert users can skip the details?

            Text flow

          <td>
            Read your draft more than once.

            * Is the documentation direct and to the point?
            * Did you use bullets, tables, or clamshells to improve flow?

            Is the text easy to read?

            * Is the language clear?
            * Do you have to reread any sentences or paragraphs to understand them? If so, can you simplify the wording and sentence structure?
            * Does the doc score 40 or better on the [Flesch-Kinkaid reading ease scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)?

              If not, try taking another pass at the prose. But don't chase the Flesch-Kincaid score in itself: we're not out to frustrate ourselves, but to write docs that are a pleasure to read.
