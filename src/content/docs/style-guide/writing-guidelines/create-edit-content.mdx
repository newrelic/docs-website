We welcome your contributions! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) [to take a look](/docs/style-guide/get-started/introduction-style-guide/).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific
  timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs `@hero`
  in the [#documentation Slack
  channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation/). If you're not a
  New Relic employee, please [create a GitHub
  issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).
</Callout>

## Edit a doc [#edit-doc]

If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Tech Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions.

<Callout variant="important">
  You need a GitHub account to edit docs. If you donâ€™t have one, you can [create
  it here](https://github.com/).
</Callout>

To edit existing content without building the site locally:

1. Find a doc you'd like to edit.
2. Click **Edit file** on the top corner of the right nav.
3. In the GitHub file, click on the **pencil** icon within the code block on the top right corner to access the [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) editor.
4. Make your changes.
5. Write a meaningful commit message and description, then commit your change by creating a new branch.
6. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. Please fill in as many details as possible in the provided template.
7. And you're done!

A member of the Tech Docs team will let you know when we've published your changes.

## For bigger projects [#bigger-projects]

1. If you'd like to create an entirely new page of documentation, or move existing content, file a [Documentation Request](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose), or contact us in the`#documentation` channel.
2. The Documentation Team will review your request and follow up with you.
3. If a new page is approved you may be asked to help write the page content.
4. Follow the instructions above to submit a PR for your change.

## Create new docs [#creating-docs]

You can use [article templates](/docs/style-guide/article-templates) or [clone an existing doc](#clone-doc) as a template. To create a new doc:

1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. In `/src/content/docs/`, find a good location for your doc.
3. Using your text editor, create a new `.mdx` file or copy an existing doc.
4. Write your content.
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place.

## Clone (copy) an existing doc [#clone-doc]

Once you've cloned the `docs-website` repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc.

If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to [request translation](/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/docs-translation#request-translation).

Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too.

## Delete pages [#delete-doc]

If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by:

1. [File an issue in the docs-website repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose), or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee.
2. The Documentation Team will review the request to delete an existing documentation page.
3. If the deletion is approved, the Docs team will delete the page.

## Add or update license documentation [#license-docs]

To add or update New Relic license information, follow [standard procedures](#editing-workflow) to add or update documentation in the appropriate [**Licenses** category](/docs/licenses) on the [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com).

## Private edits [#private-edits]

If you have access to a private version of this repository, you can contribute and review content without sharing it publicly.

Note that, with all of these steps, if you have SSH Keys set up, you will want to use the SSH URL (not the HTTPS URL).

## Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) [#hold-for-release]

For docs work related to unreleased features, please use our [beta repo](https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site) (Internal New Relic link)

If you create a new doc and submit a pull request in the private Docs repo and then contact the Tech Docs `@hero` in the [#documentation Slack channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation/).

The Tech Docs hero will follow up with you to get any additional details needed so that we can get this content published at the right time.
