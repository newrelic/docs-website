This doc explains required styles and recommended phrasings for pricing-related requirements.

## Explanations of philosophy

If you haven't already, please read [Overview of pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/) to understand our two different pricing models. This will help you understand our guidelines around pricing-related language. 

We attempt to minimize reference to pricing/billing impacts in the docs, with these two main exceptions:

* We have a high level of pricing/billing detail in the [pricing/billing-related docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/). 
* When a feature requires a pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise), we should place that in the requirements of a feature's doc. Because there are only a few things in the Pro and Enterprise editions, this should be an infrequent need.

## Style and formatting [#style-format]

Some notes on style and formatting for pricing-related language: 

* Pricing models: 
    * Use the word "model" to refer to our two pricing models: the New Relic One pricing model, and our original pricing model. 
    * Examples of referring to models: 
        * *If you're on our New Relic One pricing model...*
        * *If you're on our original pricing model...*
    * When referencing a model, it's good practice to point to either the doc for that model, or else the [doc explaining the differences between the models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-user-table), whichever makes more sense. 
* "usage-based." The New Relic One pricing model can be referred to as “usage-based” or “consumption-based,” but “usage-based” is the most commonly used and most preferred term.
* Editions:  
    * Our pricing editions are not "plans" or "models"; they are "editions". 
    * Our pricing editions are formatted with title case: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Example use: *If your organization is on the [Pro edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)...*
    * Do **not** use "tier" to refer to the concept of "edition."
    * For recommendations for how to mention the edition in feature requirements docs, see [edition guidelines](#edition-guidelines). 
* Free tier. The so-called New Relic One pricing model's [free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free) isn't actually a specific plan or a specific edition. There's nothing special about it. It is simply a situation where an organization is on the Standard edition but isn't yet paying money (either because they haven't put in a credit card or because they're under the free limits of usage). 
* Usage plans: 
    * The New Relic One pricing model has two usage plans: pay-as-you-go and annual pool of funds. 
    * Example use: *On the pay-as-you-go usage plan, your organization...*
    * Internally, we sometimes use abbreviations for these usage plans (PAYG and APoF) but do not use those in public-facing communication.  
* Billable users. For how to reference basic users and full users, see [User-related language guidelines](/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/user-related-language-guidelines). 

## Exception for agreement- and contract-related language [#license-docs]

Our license docs ([like this one](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions)) use a different style and formatting than what we recommend above. Those docs are more legal/agreement-oriented. One different is that they use title case (for example, `the Usage Plan`) to reference agreement/contract terms they have specifically [defined](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/legacy-product-definitions). 

## Recommendations for referencing edition in requirements [#edition-guidelines]

When you document a pricing edition-related restriction, use the following approach:

* **Requirements section:** When documenting features that require the Pro or Enterprise edition, add edition requirements in a "requirements" section of the doc, with wording like: "This requires a Pro or Enterprise edition." Only add pricing-related wording for the specific features that Pro and Enterprise edition give access to; this is a fairly small set of features.
* **Pricing requirements in one section:** As a general rule, attempt to place any pricing edition requirement in a single location and avoid putting it in multiple paragraphs.
* **Original pricing model:** At this point, only add edition-related requirements for the New Relic One pricing model editions, not original pricing model editions. The original pricing model will be more and more de-emphasized over time, as more customers get on the new pricing model, so there shouldn't be much need to mention original pricing aspects or edit those docs.
