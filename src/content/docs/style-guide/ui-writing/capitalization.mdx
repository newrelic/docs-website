title: Capitalization
---

Capitalization helps communicate the importance of specific words and can be used to indicate a change in meaning. To keep this effective, we need to limit what we capitalize.

## Basics

-   As of February 2023, use title case for three types of UI content:
    - Page titles
    - Left navigation (main navigation)
    - Titles on All Capabilities page tiles
-   Use sentence case the rest of the time.
-   Capitalize the first letter of proper nouns (product names, countries, acronyms, and people's names) regardless of where they appear in a sentence.
-   Capitalize product names as described on the page [Product and capabilities: capitalization, trademarks, and usage](/docs/style-guide/capitalization/product-capability-feature-usage). 
-   Don't capitalize articles (a, an, the) or prepositions (of, on, for, in, to, with, etc.) unless they're at the beginning of a sentence.

## Units of measurement

Memory, bandwidth, and drive space abbreviations have varied rules for capitalization.

-   Always include a space between the value and unit of measurement.
-   A single bit of data is lowercase (b) whereas 1,204+ bits is sentence case (13 Kb).
-   Bytes are always uppercase (13 KB, 512 MB).

Weights and distance are lowercase with no periods after the abbreviation (ft, lbs, km).

| Do      | Don't   |
| ------- | ------- |
| 32 Kb/s | 32 kb/s |
| 16 s    | 16s     |
| 0.43 MB | .43 MB  |
| 15 ft   | 15 ft.  |
