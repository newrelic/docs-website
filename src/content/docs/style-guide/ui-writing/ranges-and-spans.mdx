title: Ranges and spans
---
Ranges refer to minimum and maximum values, whereas spans refer to the distance between values. For instance, a date range from March 1, 2017 to May 1, 2017 spans 61 days.

## Basics

-   Use an en dash (option + -) between two values in ranges and spans.
-   For dates and dollar amounts, include a space on either side of the en dash.
-   For undefined ranges, specify the lowest possible value and add a + after the value.
-   When adding a + to abbreviated numbers, add it after the abbreviation.

## Time ranges

When referring to a block or span of time, like the one selected in the time picker, use "time range."

| Do                            | Don't                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Time range                    | Time frame, time span...       |
| Select a different time range | Select a different time frame. |
