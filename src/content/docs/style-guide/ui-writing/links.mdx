title: Links
---

Links in our UI need to be concise and match our style and voice.

## Basics

* Keep link text short to optimize for screen readers.
* Start with the benefit to the reader, not the link location.
* Use conversational language, pronouns, and contractions, as we do in our other copy.
* Use the name or description of the location, instead of simply "this link."
* For links that take users out of the product (like to our Docs sor Support sites), add the external link icon to the end.

## Code

When presenting code snippets to customers, format them with the Menlo monospace font.

```
var example = "This is an example string in a monospace font!";
```

## Lists

* Capitalize the first letter of each list item.
* For general lists of information, use unordered (bullet) lists.
* For lists with specific steps, use an ordered (number) list.
