title: Tooltips
---

We have various use cases for tooltips, all of which need approachable, clear language and direction.

## Basics

-   Think about what the user needs to know, feel, and do in each situation.
-   Use conversational language.
-   For single-line tooltips, like icon names and actions, keep language short and specific, and don't end with a period.
-   For richer tooltips, like definitions, include why the element is important to the user, and end full sentences with a period.
-   Include a link to more information where available.
