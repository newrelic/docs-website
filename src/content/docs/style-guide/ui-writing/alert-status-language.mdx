title: Alert status language
---

## Basics

We show colored indicators for alert status in the UI, and it's important for us to use language that's consistent across our UI screens and APIs. We're also starting to include more in this status than just alerts.

Include a hover state to explain the meaning of the color, when needed. For the main status badges on an individual entity page, the hover state will list out what contributes. If this isn't possible, use the hover states below.

## Mapping between UI and API wording

| Color    | UI hover (tooltip)            | UI status label  | API            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Red      | Critical incident in progress | Critical         | CRITICAL       |
| Yellow   | Warning incident in progress  | Degraded         | WARNING        |
| Green    | No alerts in progress         | Operational      | NOT_ALERTING   |
| Gray     | Not reporting                 | Status unknown   | NOT_CONFIGURED |
| No color | -no hover state-              | -no hover state- |                |
