title: Places and names
---

Internally we commonly refer to locations with an abbreviated form (PDX rather than Portland, OR) and people by their first name only (Lew, rather than Lew Cirne). For customer-facing text we need to be unified in how we present this information to mitigate any confusion.

## Basics

-   Capitalize proper nouns.
-   Use a location’s proper name when referring to it as a noun.
