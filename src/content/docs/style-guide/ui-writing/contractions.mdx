title: Contractions
---

Contractions are a great way to give your writing a more conversational and personal feel. Use them when it feels natural to do so.

## Basics

-   Use common contractions in the same places you would use them if you were speaking to someone.
-   Avoid using uncommon or unnatural sounding contractions.
