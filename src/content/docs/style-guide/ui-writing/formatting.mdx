title: Formatting
---

Similar to punctuation, formatting text can have a huge impact on the way people interpret our words. For example, you can use bold text as a simple tool for emphasis in a message, or you can use it to guide a person's eyes around the UI so they instinctively know what is important.

## Basics

-   Bold text is often used to improve scannability in the UI and emphasize specific words in longer texts.
-   Italics are often used for contextual hint text under input elements and can convey either a focused tone or a hushed tone to the text.
-   Underlined text in UI can easily be interpreted as a link, so be careful when using the format for a different purpose. Consider finding an alternative solution to underlined words that will not function as links.

## Code

When presenting code snippets to customers, format them with the Menlo monospace font.

```javascript
var example = 'This is an example string in a monospace font!';
```

## Lists

-   Capitalize the first letter of each list item.
-   For general lists of information, use unordered (bullet) lists.
-   For lists with specific steps, use an ordered (number) list.
