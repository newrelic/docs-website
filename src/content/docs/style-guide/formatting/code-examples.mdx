We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language.

## When to use code formatting [#when_code]

The following table provides some examples of our use of code format.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        For this...
      </th>

      <th>
        Why use code?
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        File paths and file names
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code helps paths and file names stand out, and ensures clarity about the exact file name.
      </td>

      <td>
        The agent looks for `newrelic.config` in the `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent` directory.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        NRDB event names and attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        Many attribute names (such as `duration`) look like ordinary English words. Formatting them as code helps clarify that we're talking about a specific data point.
      </td>

      <td>
        To analyze APM errors, use the `TransactionError` event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Method names
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code formatting for method names is standard practice.
      </td>

      <td>
        To initialize the APM agent, use `startAgent()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        URLs you don't intend to be clicked
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code formatting hints to the user that they may need to customize or tweak the URL to ensure it works for them.
      </td>

      <td>
        In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Command line utility names
      </td>

      <td>
        If you think a reader or translator might confuse a command with a general English word, use code.

        * `curl`: Sends http requests via a terminal session–not to be confused with the curls you do with weights at the gym.
        * `cat`: Lists the first ten lines of a file–not a feline pet who ignores you.
        * `date`: Displays the day, year, and time–not an outing that couples take.
        * `tail`: Displays the last ten lines of a file–not the appendage on various mammals.
        * `which`: Show the location of a program executable–not the pronoun.
      </td>

      <td>
        To install the utility, use `apt`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Inline code formatting [#inline-code]

To format inline code (like `maxSampleTimes` or `TransactionError`), surround the text with backtick `` ` `` characters.

## Multi-line code blocks [#code-block]

To format one or more lines of code, insert three backticks ( ```` ``` ```` ) above and below your code. This essentially acts like the HTML `<pre>` tag.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="synax-highlight-example"
    title="Syntax highlighting example"
  >
    To add syntax highlighting to a code block, insert the language name on the same line as the first three backtacks. Here's an example using some Java code:

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing how to format a Java code block"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to format a Java code block"
      src={codeExamples}
    />

    This is what the formatting looks like when it's published:

    ```java
    public class SampleTester {

        private String configName;
        private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes;

        public SampleTester(String pConfigName) {
            configName = pConfigName;
            maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>();
        }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-syntax-highlighting"
    title="Is syntax highlighting supported for your language?"
  >
  If you're not sure if our site will format the code snippets for your particular language, do the following:

    1. See if your language is included in the [default list](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js).

    2. If you don't see the language you want to format in the default list, check if it is included in [`gatsby-config.js`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/gatsby-config.js) (look under `prism:`). This file lists all the languages we've added beyond the default list.

    3. If you still can't find your language, you can make a PR to add it to `gatsby-config.js`. Before you submit a PR, make sure this language is listed in the [Prism site](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).

    If your code snippet contains `<var>` tags, it will not be formatted.

## Highlight user input with `<var>` [#var-tags]

The `<var>` tag is used to highlight areas the user needs to customize the value in a code snippet. For example: you might use `<var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>` to draw a user's attention to a place they'll need to input their account ID.

Follow these guidelines when you use `<var>` tags:

* Address the reader directly (`YOUR_CONFIG_FILE` not `CONFIG_FILE`).
* Use all caps and underscores `_` to separate words (also known as [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#screaming-snake-case)).
* Don't combine them with other punctuation to indicate variables (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets or curly braces).
* Don't overuse them. For example, if you're showing a complete config file where the user is expected to customize many values, a `<var>` tag on each configurable value is overkill.

Do **not** use a `<var>` tag for:

* Example code: If the code is meant to be an example, to show the format of the code, and there is not an actual procedure the customer is following, var tags are not needed. A couple reasons for this: 1) The important part of showing an example config file is to show the overall structure of the file, 2) Usually the number of config options present in a file will vary based on whatever the customer wishes to use, so using `<var>` tags can actually be confusing as it implies that these values must be present. Examples:
  * [Example configuration file](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/oracledb-monitoring-integration#example-config) (or this [Java agent config template](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-config-file-template)): if you are showing an example config file that isn't part of a procedure, you shouldn't use the `<var>` tag.
  * [Instrumentation procedure](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/enable-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda#java) (at bottom of the Java section): the var tag wouldn't be necessary because it's an example, not part of a procedure, and the main goal is seeing the general structure. Also, because it's an example of app code, the concept of user-specific values doesn't have much meaning, because the entire code will vary dependent on how the customer has written their code. (If anything, this would be a potential for using [`<mark>` format](#highlighting) to emphasize the New Relic functions.)
* Response/output code: If the code is meant to show an expected return, and is not related to a procedure, then var tags shouldn't be used. Here's [a doc section](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#get-all-monitors) (the returned JSON) where var tags are not needed.

For some use cases, [highlighting](#annotate-mark) may be a better choice than a `var` tag.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="var-tag-examples"
    title="Examples of `<var>` tag use"

    Below are some general style recommendations for formatting user-specific `<var>` values. `<var>` tag formatting may vary based on language- or system-specific expectations, so be sure check the style used in the documentation section in question, and to ask relevant SMEs what they think of the style.

    * Account IDs and other IDs/#s: `<var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>`, `<var>YOUR_API_KEY</var>`, etc. **This should be the general style used.**
    * URLs: [example.com](https://example.com), or maybe <var>`YOUR_URL`</var>
    * Paths: `<var>PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe</var>` or maybe `<var>PATH_TO_FILE</var>`
    * Emails: [datanerd@example.com](mailto:datanerd@example.com) or maybe `<var>YOUR_EMAIL</var>`
    * Bash variables for REST API code: Some `<var>` tagged code values on the docs site have the form $&#x7B;API_KEY}. This is a format used for variables in bash scripts, where users assign values to specific variable names and then call those variables later in the script by using the $VARIABLE_NAME. For more info, see this [explanation of bash variables](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-5.html).

      <Callout variant="important">
        The bash variable style is currently used in the REST API docs, and in some Synthetics docs. However, going forward we should use the general variable style, without the $ and `&lt;` >.

## Highlight a code section with `<mark>` [#annotate-mark]

Use the `<mark>` tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important but not directly procedural-related. Most commonly, `<mark>` is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of "other logic." They're also handy when you want to indicate a bit of code that will be referenced later in a procedure or doc.

Here are two examples of highlighting:

* Highlighting values in code response that are meant for later use: [Activate Azure integrations doc](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations#get-ids).
* Highlighting the commands in a large code block example that are New Relic-specific commands, with explanations below: [Java API doc](/docs/agents/java-agent/async-instrumentation/java-agent-api-asynchronous-applications#use-gettoken).

When you use `<mark>`, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="mark-tag-example"
    title="Example of using the <mark> tag"
  >
    ```
    private void storeItem(long id) {
        Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). <mark>startSegment("storeItem")</mark>;

          segment.<mark>reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters
                  .product("H2")
                  .collection(null)
                  .operation("insert")
                  .instance("localhost", 8080)
                  .databaseName("test")
                  .build())</mark>;

          // fire and forget
          DB_POOL.submit(() -> {
              <mark>segment.end()</mark>;
              insertData(id);
          });
      }
    ```

    The agent API calls in this sample are:

    * `startSegment(...)`: Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
    * `reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters())`: Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with [datastore data](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). For more information, see [reportAsExternal API](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/index.html?com/newrelic/api/agent/TracedMethod.html). For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
    * `segment.end()`: Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
