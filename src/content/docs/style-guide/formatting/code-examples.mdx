We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language.

## When to use code formatting [#when_code]

The following table provides some examples of our use of code format.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        For this...
      </th>

      <th>
        Why use code?
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        File paths and file names
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code helps paths and file names stand out, and ensures clarity about the exact file name.
      </td>

      <td>
        The agent looks for `newrelic.config` in the `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent` directory.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        NRDB event names and attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        Many attribute names (such as `duration`) look like ordinary English words. Formatting them as code helps clarify that we're talking about a specific data point.
      </td>

      <td>
        To analyze APM errors, use the `TransactionError` event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Method names
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code formatting for method names is standard practice.
      </td>

      <td>
        To initialize the APM agent, use `startAgent()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        URLs you don't intend to be clicked
      </td>

      <td>
        Using code formatting hints to the user that they may need to customize or tweak the URL to ensure it works for them.
      </td>

      <td>
        In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Command line utility names
      </td>

      <td>
        If you think a reader or translator might confuse a command with a general English word, use code.

        * `curl`: Sends http requests via a terminal session–not to be confused with the curls you do with weights at the gym.
        * `cat`: Lists the first ten lines of a file–not a feline pet who ignores you.
        * `date`: Displays the day, year, and time–not an outing that couples take.
        * `tail`: Displays the last ten lines of a file–not the appendage on various mammals.
        * `which`: Show the location of a program executable–not the pronoun.
      </td>

      <td>
        To install the utility, use `apt`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Inline code formatting [#inline-code]

To format inline code (like `maxSampleTimes` or `TransactionError`), surround the text with backtick `` ` `` characters.

## Multi-line code blocks [#code-block]

To format one or more lines of code, insert three backticks ( ```` ``` ```` ) above and below your code. This essentially acts like the HTML `<pre>` tag.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="synax-highlight-example"
    title="Syntax highlighting example"
  >
    To add syntax highlighting to a code block, insert the language name on the same line as the first three backtacks. Here's an example using some Java code:

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing how to format a Java code block"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to format a Java code block"
      src={styleguideSyntaxHighlightingExampleCode}
    />

    This is what the formatting looks like when it's published:

    ```java
    public class SampleTester {

        private String configName;
        private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes;

        public SampleTester(String pConfigName) {
            configName = pConfigName;
            maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>();
        }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-syntax-highlighting"
    title="Is syntax highlighting supported for your language?"
  >
  If you're not sure if our site will format the code snippets for your particular language, do the following:

    1. See if your language is included in the [default list](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js).

    2. If you don't see the language you want to format in the default list, check if it is included in [`gatsby-config.js`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/gatsby-config.js) (look under `prism:`). This file lists all the languages we've added beyond the default list.

    3. If you still can't find your language, you can make a PR to add it to `gatsby-config.js`. Before you submit a PR, make sure this language is listed in the [Prism site](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).

## Customer-specific values [#value-placeholders]

Traditionally, we've used `<var>` tags for customer-specific value placeholders in code snippets. For example: we'd use `<var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>` to draw a user's attention to a place they'd need to input their account ID.

In November of 2022, we found out that language-specific [syntax highlighting](#synax-highlight-example) doesn't work with var tags: Using var tags in a code block disables syntax-specific coloring for that block. Going forward, for customer-specific value placeholders, avoid using var tags and instead focus on creating strong placeholder text to make it clear to customers what they should put in those places. For example, instead of using `<var>YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>`, we'd remove the var tags and make it a bit more descriptive, like `INSERT_YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID`. 

That said, `<var>` tags can still be used if you think it's important to highlight something in a code snippet and you're okay losing syntax highlighting. For tips on using var tags, see [Var tags](#var-tags).

Some tips on crafting customer-specific value placeholders: 

* Use `INSERT` to make it more clear what customers are to do. 
* Address the reader directly using `YOUR`. For example, use `INSERT_YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID` and not `INSERT_NR_ACCOUNT_ID`.
* Use all caps and underscores `_` to separate words (also known as [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#screaming-snake-case)).
* Don't combine them with other punctuation to indicate variables (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets or curly braces).
* If you explicitly say that a customer must replace some values, you can break some of the usual rules. For example, if you preface a code snippet with an instruction that they'll have to replace some of the values, you can use more brief placeholder text, like `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` or `YOUR_USER_KEY`. 
* **Don't** use placeholders for either of these situations: 
  * Example code or files: if you're showing an example config file or another example that's simply meant to give a rough sense of what something will look like, and there is no direct procedure involved, you don't have to worry about placeholders and can use example values. 
  * Results of API calls: if you're including the response of a call, you also don't have to use placeholders.

    Below are some general style recommendations for formatting user-specific values: 

    * Account IDs and other IDs/#s: `INSERT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`, `INSERT_YOUR_NR_USER_KEY`, etc. **This should be the general style used.**
    * URLs: [example.com](https://example.com), or maybe `INSERT_YOUR_URL`
    * Paths: `PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe` or maybe `PATH_TO_FILE`
    * Emails: [datanerd@example.com](mailto:datanerd@example.com) or maybe `INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL`
    * Bash variables for REST API code: Some code values on the docs site have the form $&#x7B;API_KEY}. This is a format used for variables in bash scripts, where users assign values to specific variable names and then call those variables later in the script by using the $VARIABLE_NAME. For more info, see this [explanation of bash variables](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-5.html).

      <Callout variant="important">
        The bash variable style is currently used in the REST API docs, and in some Synthetics docs. However, going forward we should use the general variable style.

### Tips on using var tags [#var-tags]

If it's important to highlight something in a code snippet and you're okay losing syntax highlighting, you can use `<var>` tags. Some examples of why you'd do this:

* To highlight values in a code snippet that you want to define or that customers will later use. For an example of this, see this [Activate Azure integrations doc](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations#get-ids).
* To highlight multiple lines of code to draw attention to the snippet a customer needs to use or input. Note that in this case, you may need to use var tags around each line to avoid excessive highlighting.
