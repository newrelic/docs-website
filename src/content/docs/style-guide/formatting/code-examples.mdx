We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the `<code>`, `<pre>`, and `<var>` tags to indicate "raw" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path.

## When to use code formatting [#when_code]

The following table provides some examples of our use of code format.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        For this...
      </th>
      <th>
        Why use code?
      </th>
      <th>
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Command line utility names
      </td>
      <td>
        If you think a reader or translator might confuse a command with a general English word, use code. Some common examples include:

          * `curl`: Sends http requests via a terminal session–not to be confused with the curls you do with weights at the gym.
          * `cat`: Lists the first ten lines of a file–not a feline pet who ignores you.
          * `date`: Displays the day, year, and time–not an outing that couples take.
          * `tail`: Displays the last ten lines of a file–not the appendage on various mammals.
          * `which`: Show the location of a program executable–not the pronoun.

      </td>
      <td>
        To install the utility, use `apt`.
      </td>
    </tr>
      
    <tr>
      <td>
        File paths and file names
      </td>
      <td>
        Using code helps paths and file names stand out, and ensures clarity about the exact file name.
      </td>
      <td>
        The agent looks for `newrelic.config` in the `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent` directory.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        NRDB event names and attributes
      </td>
      <td>
        Many attribute names (such as `duration`) look like ordinary English words. Formatting them as code helps clarify that we're talking about a specific data point.
      </td>
      <td>
        To analyze APM errors, use the `TransactionError` event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Method names
      </td>
      <td>
        Using code formatting for method names is standard practice.
      </td>
      <td>
        To initialize the APM agent, use `startAgent()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        URLs you don't intend to be clicked
      </td>
      <td>
        Using code formatting hints to the user that they may need to customize or tweak the URL to ensure it works for them.
      </td>
      <td>
        In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Inline code formatting [#inline-code]

To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), surround the text with backtick `` ` `` characters.

## Multi-line code blocks [#code-block]
  
To format multi-line code blocks with a copy-paste button, surround the block of text with three backtick characters:

<pre>
  ```
  This is a code block
  ```
</pre>

Markdown also supports creating code blocks by indenting text. However, this can behave unpredictably because a lot of our other formatting elements like tables and collapser also include indentation.

## Highlight user input with `<var>` [#var-tags]

The `<var>` tag is used to highlight areas the user needs to customize the value in a code snippet.

Follow these guidelines when you use `<var>` tags:

* Address the reader directly (`YOUR_CONFIG_FILE` not `CONFIG_FILE`).
* Use all caps and underscores `_` to separate words (also known as [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#screaming-snake-case)).
* Don't combine them with other punctuation to indicate variables (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets or curly braces).
* Don't overuse them. For example, if you're showing a complete config file where the user is expected to customize many values, a `<var>` tag on each configurable value is overkill.

Examples:

```
echo "license_key: <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
```

```
<var>PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe</var>
```

```
msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO</var>\newrelic-infra.msi
```

## Annotate code with `<mark>` [#annotate-mark]

Use the `<mark>` tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, `<mark>` is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of "other logic." They're also handy when you want to indicate a bit of code that will be referenced later in a procedure or doc. 

When you use `<mark>`, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. 

For example: 

```
  private void storeItem(long id) {
    Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). <mark>startSegment("storeItem")</mark>;

      segment.<mark>reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters
              .product("H2")
              .collection(null)
              .operation("insert")
              .instance("localhost", 8080)
              .databaseName("test")
              .build())</mark>;

      // fire and forget
      DB_POOL.submit(() -> {
          <mark>segment.end()</mark>;
          insertData(id);
      });
  }
```

The agent API calls in this sample are:

* `startSegment(...)`: Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
* `reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters())`: Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with [datastore data](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). For more information, see [reportAsExternal API](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/index.html?com/newrelic/api/agent/TracedMethod.html). For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
* `segment.end()`: Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the [Javadoc](https://example.com).
