Onramps content is information that appears our UI when a user clicks the **?** icon. This content is meant to be truncated and contextualized to where the user is and what they need to know to perform a task.

## How should I name the titles of onramps content?

### FAQ structure

When applicable, use an FAQ format where the headers are in question format.

Example:

**Can I get notifications for issues?**
You can get notifications through email, Slack, Jira, and more. To learn how to set up notifications, see [Introduction to alert notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications/).

### Regular headers

If FAQ format is not applicable, use our standard headers for titles.

Example:

**Forward logs to New Relic**
Forwarding logs to New Relic allows you to have all logs in one place.

## What if a tile has two states (active and empty)?

A tile is something that's clickable and may or may not contain data, depending on if customers have set it up. This is called an active vs. an empty state, and it's something to consider when writing onramps content. If the tile has no data, it's in empty state, and if the user clicks on it, they may be directed to a set up page. If it has data, it's in active state, and our onramps content will want to help users interpret the data.

For example, here's a tile in active and empty states, and the content that touches on both scenarios.

<table>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmActiveEmptyState}
/>
            </td>
            <td>
                **What are service levels?**
                Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view.

                When a service level’s error budget is exceeded, you’ll see these violation types:
                * Non-compliant means you've consumed all of the error budget for this period. So be careful if you need to deploy, and plan some work to improve your SLs.
                * At risk means your error budget is nearly consumed, and you should be more cautious for the rest of the period.


                **How do I view/create a service level?** 
                To add a new service level, go to Service Levels and click Add a service level. 
                
                **How do I get notified for service level violations?**
                Go to **Service Levels**, click a service level, and click **Alert**.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## How long should the content be?

If you're not using collapsers, **keep the character count under 1200** for the entire onramps section.

## How should I bold/italicize to emphasize something?

Style guide for how to emphasize, considering we can’t use backtick code formatting. But assume we can use bold, and maybe we can be okay with italics? Or quotes? 

## How much detail should I include?

If the onramps content isn't in the main place where the feature is (like for the Service levels tile on the APM Summary page), then it’s not the place to include a lot of detail.

## Should I add docs links?

It's okay to add a link to docs "for more details" on something, but here are some considerations:
* Add a docs link if there's relevant information and it's too long to summarize/explain in onramps. 
* The onramps content will persist after the user clicks on something, so add a docs link if it's relevant to where the user might go next (i.e., if you click on the Issues tile and are taken to the **Issues** page, you'll still see the onramps popup on the same, so you may want to learn how to configure issue thresholds on this page).

## How should I reference UI navigation instructions?

 Let's say you want to direct users to something relevant in the UI and need to add navigation instructions. For example, if a user clicks on the Issues tile and they want to get alerts for issues (which is on another UI page). You have two options:
 * Link them to the docs (i.e., "To create an alert condition, see [Create your first alert](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/).")
 * Provide instructions directly to the UI page (i.e., "[Create an alert condition here](https://onenr.io/0kjnAlvY9Ro)).
