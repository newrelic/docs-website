You can toggle between languages with a button in the top menu bar.

## View translation status [#translation-status]

Every doc's frontmatter includes its human translation status.

If there is no `translate:` element in the frontmatter, the doc is not human-translated into any languages. It will still be automatically translated into all our machine-translated languages.

If the `translate:` element has a language abbreviation, such as `jp`, then the doc has been translated, will be translated, or is under consideration for translation. For example:

```md
---
title: 'NRQL reference'
translate:
  - jp
  - kr
  - es
  - pt
  - fr
metaDescription: "A detailed reference list of clauses and functions in NRQL, the New Relic query language."
redirects:
  - /docs/insights/using-nrql
```

## Update translated doc [#update-translation]

The site runs an automatic job once a day to automatically translate changes to docs into target languages.

## Show SEO status for translated docs [#translation-seo]

The site's frontend uses the doc's [translation status](#translation-status) information to display the SEO `hreflang` element for a page. This tells search engines that the page also has a version available in the specific language.

```html
<link rel="alternate" href="https://docs.newrelic.com/jp/" hreflang="ja" />
```

## Delete and move docs [#delete]

When you make changes to our English docs, you may get an unpaired translation error on GitHub. Here are scenarios where you would make changes to our i18n folder:

* When you delete an mdx file, delete the corresponding mdx file in the `/kr/` and `/jp/` folders. You do **not** update the yaml file.
* When you move an mdx file from folder X to folder Y, you need to move that same mdx file to folder Y in  `/kr/` and `/jp/`. You do **not** update the yaml file.
* When you move an mdx file to a new folder, you need to create that new folder in  `/kr/` and `/jp/`, then move the mdx file into it. You do **not** update the yaml file.

Instead of manually deleting or moving files, run these command sequences:

* To move/rename translated files:

  ```bash
  yarn i18n-utility list-renames
  yarn i18n-utility make-renames
  ```

* To delete translated files:

  ```bash
  yarn i18n-utility list-orphans
  yarn i18n-utility delete-orphans
  ```
