New Relic documentation exists on these sites:

* [**docs.newrelic.com**](https://docs.newrelic.com): English
* [**docs.newrelic.com/jp/**](https://docs.newrelic.com/jp/): Japanese
* [**docs.newrelic.com/kr/**](https://docs.newrelic.com/kr/): Korean

You can toggle between languages with a button in the top menu bar.

## View translation status [#translation-status]

Every doc's frontmatter includes its translation status.

If there is no `translate:` element in the frontmatter, the doc has not been translated into any other languages.

If the `translate:` element has a language abbreviation, such as `jp`, then the doc has been translated, will be translated, or is under consideration for translation. For example:

```jsx
---
title: 'NRQL reference'
translate:
  - jp
  - kr
metaDescription: "A detailed reference list of clauses and functions in NRQL, the New Relic query language."
redirects:
  - /docs/insights/using-nrql
```

## Update translated doc [#update-translation]

The site runs an automatic job once a day to automatically translate changes to docs into target languages.

## Show SEO status for translated docs [#translation-seo]

The site's front end uses the doc's [translation status](#translation-status) information to display the SEO `hreflang` element for a page. This tells search engines that the page also has a version available in the specific language.

```
<link rel="alternate" href="https://docs.newrelic.com/jp/" hreflang="ja" />
```
