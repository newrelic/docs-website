Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. There are several things you need to do get this working. Fortunately, you only need to do this once.

## Using the terminal and command line [#terminal]

On macOS, you can use the Terminal app to access your system's command line. (You can also access the terminal via VS Code.) The command line is an alternative to the graphical user interface.

Here are some basic terminal commands that might be useful:

* **pwd** (print working directory): Use this to see your directory path.
* **ls** (list): Shows the files in your current directory.
* **cd** YOUR_DIRECTORY_PATH (change directory): Moves to another directory.
* **cd ..**: Move one directory up in your path.

## Enable VS Code in your terminal [#code-terminal]

It's handy to be able to open files from your terminal directly in VS Code. You may only use this a couple of times, but it's much nicer than trying to edit files in the terminal itself.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Press **command + shift + p** to open the command palette, then type "install code", and then click **Shell command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.
3. In your terminal, type `code` YOUR_FILENAME\` to open that file in VS Code.

## 1. Use GitHub Desktop to set up your local repository [#repo-setup]

GitHub Desktop is a graphical tool for managing your branches, commits, and PRs. It's probably the most straightforward way to work with Git and GitHub.

1. Install GitHub Desktop.
2. Sign in to GitHub Desktop via your GitHub account. On Macs, click **GitHub Desktop** in the top left corner of your screen and select **Preferences**. Select the blue **Sign In** button, and follow the prompts in the browser window.
3. Navigate to the [Docs Site repository](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website).
4. Click the green **Code** button and select **Open with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)**.
5. Choose the location where you want the repo. The default location for this folder is `~/Documents/github`.
6. Clone the entire repository to your local machine.

## 2. Enable full disk access [#disk-access]

By default, it seems that macOS prevents the terminal from access to certain system folders, like `Documents`. Change this setting to make it easier to navigate in your file system via the terminal.

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Click **Security & Privacy**.
3. In the left pane, scroll down until you find **Full Disk Access** and then select it.
4. Click the lock in the bottom left corner and then enter the password you use to log in to your computer.
5. In the list of apps, check the box next to **Terminal** (or whatever your default terminal application is).
6. Click the lock to lock it.

## 3. Install Homebrew [#homebrew]

Homebrew is a command line tool for installing other applications. It's also an easy way to keep command line software updated.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Copy and paste this command to your terminal:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## 4. Install npm (Node.js package manager)[#npm]

You need to install `npm` so that you can also install `nvm` (Node.js version manager). In your terminal, type `brew install npm`.

## 5. Install nvm (Node version manager) [#nvm]

Node version manager (`nvm`) is what you use to manage the version of Node.js installed on your computer. In your terminal, type `npm i -g nvm`.

## 6. Add nvm to your shell profile [#add-nvm]

In order to run the commands you need for your local build, you need to add the path to `nvm` to your shell profile.

On macOS, your shell is what interprets what you enter on the command line. The default macOS shell is Zsh. You need to tell your shell the directory where `nvm` is on your machine so you can run these commands from anywhere.

You do this by adding the following text to your `.zshrc` file, which is a config file for your shell.

1. In your terminal, type `code ~/.zshrc` to open this file in VS Code.
2. In the `.zshrc` file, copy and paste this text:

```shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

3. Save the file.

## 7. Install Node.js [#node]

Once you've installed `nvm`, you can install the correct version of Node. Node, or Node.js, is the JavaScript engine that powers our Gatsby site and its dependencies. Type `nvm use 16` to install Node.js version 16.

## 8. Install Yarn [#yarn]

Yarn is another package manager used to compile all of the files in the **docs-website** repo to build the site locally. Use npm to install Yarn. In your terminal, type `npm i -g yarn`.

## Build the local site [#local-site]

Once you've installed all of these things in your terminal, you can run the site locally on your machine.

1. In your terminal, type `pwd` to make sure you're in the **docs-website** repository directory.
2. Type `yarn` to make sure all your Gatsby dependencies are up to date.
3. Type `yarn start` to build the site locally.
4. When the process finishes, in your web browser, go to `http://localhost:8000`.

When you run `yarn start`, your terminal outputs many lines of text. If your local build fails, the terminal output often provides a clue to what's gone wrong.

By default the site will build without any translated (jp, kr) pages. If you would like to build those pages as well, you can run `yarn start:full`.

## Build part of the local site (faster) [#local-site-speed]

If you would like to build the site even more quickly, you can opt to build a single folder (or as many as you'd like) instead of every doc on the site. This can be nice if you know you're working on an account doc for instance, you can build only the account folder. However, this means that if you try to visit a doc in a folder outside of what you specified, you'll see a `404`.

To build one or more specific folders, add this variable to your `yarn start` command:

`BUILD_FOLDERS=mlops yarn start`
or
`BUILD_FOLDERS=apm,logs,errors-inbox yarn start`

Tips:

* The folder(s) you specify must be at the root level of the `/src/content/docs/` directory. This doesn't include any subdirectories. For example, `browser` is a valid folder, but `browser-monitoring` is not because it's a subdirectory of `browser`.
* Make sure there are no spaces after the commas in your folder list. For example, type `BUILD_FOLDERS=apis,infrastructure` not `BUILD_FOLDERS=apis, infrastructure`.
