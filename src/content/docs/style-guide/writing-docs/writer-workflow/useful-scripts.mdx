title: Useful scripts to verify your work
metaDescription: "When you're working on docs, use these useful scripts to help you make sure that you've done it right."
---

Our lovely engineering team has put together a handful of useful scripts to make writing for our site easier. Run these commands in your terminal when you're in the `docs-website` repository directory. Read on for information on how and when to use them.

## clean [#clean]

```bash
yarn clean
```

Use `yarn clean` to clear out your cache files. This can make your local builds run more smoothly. "I run this every time before I start a local build," one of our engineers told me. Use it liberally and often.

## verify-mdx [#mdx]

```bash
yarn verify-mdx PATH_TO_MDX_FILE
yarn verify-mdx PATH_TO_MDX_DIRECTORY # reads files recursively
```

Use `yarn verify-mdx` to check for common issues in your MDX files. It also checks for common image import errors, like mismatches between filenames and image aliases. If you run this command without a file or folder path, it will check every single MDX file in the docs repo. This can take a few minutes.

This is a good one to run when you've touched a lot of MDX files/images or you're just not certain about some changes you've made. It's also good to use this when your local build has failed and you're not sure why.

## verify-install-page [#branching]

```bash
yarn verify-install-page PATH_TO_BRANCHING_DOC_DIRECTORY
```

Use `yarn verify-install-page` to check for common issues with branching doc files. The branching docs are all located in the `src/install` directory.

This script also passes the install directory to `verify-mdx` to check for MDX errors.

## remove-unused-images [#unused-images]

```bash
yarn remove-unused-images
```

Use `yarn remove-unused-images` to delete any image file that isn't being used by one of our docs. Specifically, it looks for any image files that don't have a matching import statement anywhere in our docs site.

This one can take a few minutes to run.
