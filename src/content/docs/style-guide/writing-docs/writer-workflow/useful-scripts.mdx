title: Useful scripts to verify your work
metaDescription: "When you're working on docs, use these useful scripts to help you make sure that you've done it right."
---

Our lovely engineering team has put together a handful of useful scripts to make writing for our site easier. Run these commands in your terminal when you're in the `docs-website` repository directory. Read on for information on how and when to use them. 

## clean [#clean]

```
yarn clean
```

Use `yarn clean` to clear out your cache files. This can make your local builds run more smoothly. "I run this every time before I start a local build," one of our engineers told me. Use it liberally and often.

## verify-mdx [#mdx]

```
yarn verify-mdx PATH_TO_MDX_FILE
```

Use `yarn verify-mdx` to check for common issues in your MDX files. If you run this command without a filepath, it will check every single MDX file in the docs repo. This can take a few minutes. 

This is a good one to run when you've touched a lot of MDX files or you're just not certain about some changes you've made. It's also good to use this when your local build has failed and you're not sure why.

## verify-install-page [#branching]

```
yarn verify-install-page PATH_TO_BRANCHING_DOC_DIRECTORY
```

Use `yarn verify-install-page` to check for common issues with branching doc files. The branching docs are all located in the `src/install` directory.

## remove-unused-images [#unused-images]

```
yarn remove-unused-images
```

Use `yarn remove-unused-images` to delete any image file that isn't being used by one of our docs. Specifically, it looks for any image files that don't have a matching import statement anywhere in our docs site. 

This one can take a few minutes to run.

## check-image-imports [#image-imports]

```
yarn check-image-imports
```

Use `yarn check-image-imports` when you've added or edited one or more images. It checks for common errors, like mismatches between filenames and image aliases.
