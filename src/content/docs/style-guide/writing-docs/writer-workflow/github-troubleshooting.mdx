Are you having problems [working on a doc in GitHub](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/tech-writer-workflow/)? Check out the following common issues.  

## GitHub authentication fails [#authentication-fail]
If you suddenly find that you can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop, you may have developed a problem with SSH. 

If logging out of GitHub Desktop via Preferences doesn’t seem to help, you can confirm if you have an SSH issue by switching to the command line and trying to push manually. For example: `git push --set-upstream origin second-kafka-pr-for-issue-1123`

If this command prompts you for a passphrase, your SSH was somehow confused. By entering your passphrase, you should be back in business. If you can’t remember your passphrase, [check out this article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/troubleshooting-ssh/recovering-your-ssh-key-passphrase).

## My build is failing mysteriously [#build-fails]
Here’s a few things you can check if your build is failing: 
* Indenting in the nav files 
* Front matter
  * If there's apostrophes and colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems.
* Missing closed brackets or tags
* Poorly formatted image links
  * Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail. 
  * Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported. 
* Image filenames 
  * Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc.
  * Images with encoded values (like `%`) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them.

## Issues with the local site [#local-site]
If you're running with issues with your local build, try these options:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="restart-yarn"
    title="Stop and restart yarn"
  >
    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the `/docs-website` directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary.
    3. Run `yarn && yarn start`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="check-branch"
    title="Ensure the problem isn't with your branch"
  >
    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary.
    3. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the Develop branch.
    4. Back in the terminal, run `yarn && yarn start`.

    If the site now builds correctly, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot.
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="clean-cache"
    title="Clean your local cache"
  >
  Run `yarn clean` to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time!
  1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory.
  2. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary.
  3. Begin a new build by running `yarn clean && yarn && yarn start`.
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="remove-cache"
    title="Remove corrupted cache files"
  >
  There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on.
  
  To solve this from your `/docs-website` directory, run `rm -rf .cache`.
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="start-build"
    title="Start a build from start"
  >
  Blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache and start a build from scratch. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes.
  
  1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory.
  2. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary.
  3. Blow away modules and cache and start from scratch by running the `kknuke` Keyboard Maestro command, or run `yarn reboot` in your terminal. 
  
  <Callout variant="important">
    If you use the `kknuke` Keyboard Maestro command, when everything completes, start the site by running `yarn start`.
  </Callout>

  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="run-incognito"
    title="Run your local build in private mode"
  >
    Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. Running the local build in a private/incognito session may to fix this issue. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## My redirect throws a 404 error when testing it locally [#redirect-404]
Redirects are a bit strange on local builds. To test them, navigate to the page that is being redirected, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, ensure you set up the redirect correctly. 

You can also test the redirects out in the Gatsby build.

## A check fails in the PR [#check-fail]
<Callout variant='important'>
The only checks needed to merge a PR are the checks marked as `required` on the PR. These are `run linter`, `run tests`, `license/cla`, and `unpaired translations removed` for merges to develop, and `build the docs site` for merges to main. If a required check fails, the failure must be addressed in order for the PR to be merged. If an optional check fails, reach out in the help channel so that the hero can look into the failure, but feel free to merge the PR since optional checks don't block releases.
</Callout>

Rarely, a build or check will fail due to some internal error. You can re-run the check by going to the PR, clicking **Details**, and then clicking **Re-run jobs**.

If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot.

## Reset the 'build the docs site' build check [#reset-gatsby]
<Callout variant="caution">
This adds a LOT of time to the build check.
</Callout>

There are times when this check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache. 

1. In your local repo, find the file `gatsby-config.js` (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode).
2. Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache. 

`const fs = require('fs');`

`const parse = require('rehype-parse');`

3. Save the file and commit the change to your PR.
4. Re-run the build checks.
5. Wait a LOOOOONG time.

## Troubleshoot merging conflicts [#merge-conflict]
Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. Here are some tips on how to get through it.
* Fix your merge conflict as soon as possible. Especially if you’re working on taxonomy changes. If your branch lingers for a while it can get outdated from develop pretty fast and that can cause some unexpected issues.
* Check your fix locally to make sure that it looks good there.
* Ask your PR approver to review your PR after you fix the merge conflict.

Here are two options to resolve conflicts:
* When you see the conflicts in GitHub desktop, click the option to resolve these in VS Code. 
* Use the GitHub website editor (click the Resolve conflict button) to fix these. 

### What’s new related merge conflicts [#merge-conflict-whats-new]
Merge conflicts pop up pretty often with what’s new posts because the `whats-new-ids.json` file that’s automatically updated when the site builds can get out-of-date pretty fast. 

If you see changes to this file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them, rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Never merge a PR that changes `whats-new-ids.json`.
