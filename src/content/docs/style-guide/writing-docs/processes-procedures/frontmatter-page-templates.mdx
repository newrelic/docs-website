The docs site doesn't have strict page templatesâ€”since we have a "docs as code" approach, writers can use a variety of components to structure docs however they think best. However, we do have several unique types of content that behave differently than our standard `.mdx` docs. This style guide page describes the standard frontmatter for docs, and also outlines the various types of content we maintain on the site. 

## Docs frontmatter and metadata [#meta-fields]

The top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Meta content field**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Title
      </td>

      <td>
        Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, "AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls." In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon `:`.

        If you're looking for ideas on how to choose a title, browse the titles of similar docs.

        The title used in the sidebar (left navigation pane) is set in [the nav file](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/update-left-navigation-pane).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `tags`
      </td>

      <td>
        Deprecated. Historically, tags were used to help search engines and AI find the right content. Modern engines are sophisticated enough to infer that context without tags, so this tag is no longer needed. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `metaDescription`
      </td>

      <td>
        A short description of the doc. Search engines rely on this field to understand what a doc is about, and they'll often show the meta description right in the search results. Should be under 160 characters. For more info on why meta descriptions matter to search, see [Control your snippets in search results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet) in Google's documentation.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `redirects`
      </td>

      <td>
        Redirects **to** this doc from old URLs. One redirect per line. Use a relative path and don't include a trailing slash `/`. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `freshnessValidatedDate`
      </td>

      <td>
        The last time a writer made significant updates to this doc and verified its accuracy. 
        
        The default is `never`. When you make a significant update to a doc, add today's date in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Document body [#body-field]

The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content.

## Page templates

For most situations, use the **basicDoc** page template. Read on for information about our other page templates.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Content type**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Basic page
      </td>

      <td>
        A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        API doc
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see [apiStyleGuidelines](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/apistyleguidelines-example-agent-api) (for style guidelines) and [Work with the API doc content type](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/api-tutorial-template) (for how to use and configure).

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attribute definition
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see [Work with attribute definition content type](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/attribute-definition-template).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Landing pages
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see [Working with landing pages](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/landing-page-template).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Release notes
      </td>

      <td>
        This format includes specific fields for release notes. Users rely on release notes to keep up with smaller changes in the product, particularly for downloadble software like the agents. For more information, see [Create release notes](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/create-release-notes/).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        What's New posts
      </td>

      <td>
        This format includes specific fields for product announcements. What's New posts are created by PMM for larger announcements. They're available in the docs site, but they're also visible in the New Relic UI. For more information, see [What's New style guidelines](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/whats-new-style-guidelines/).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Troubleshooting doc
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for troubleshooting docs in a Problem-Solution-Cause format. For more information, see [Troubleshooting docs guide](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/troubleshooting-docs-guide).
