This document describes how to change the title of a document and how to create, edit, and delete redirects. Procedures are the same for both standard docs ("basic pages") and release notes.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Changing titles or updating redirects can create issues with finding content. If you need to change a title or a redirect, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel.

## URL format [#title-url]

A document's URL is based solely on its filename and filepath in the GitHub repo. For more information, see [Doc URL](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/understand-edit-docs-site-structure#doc-url).

## Change titles [#titles]

To change a document title, change the title being used in the `title` field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc.

If you want to update a title in the sidebar, change the `title` for that doc in the nav file. 

## Change anchor links [#anchors]

Wherever possible, do not change the `[#anchor_ids]` of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor `id` is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs.

## Edit redirects [#redirects]

If you change the URL of a doc, make sure you add the old URL to the `redirects` frontmatter section at the top of the doc.
