Our docs site is made up of different content types and templates. Most of the time, the default page content type and the basic template will have everything you'll need.

Read on for more information about our page types.

## Docs meta content (frontmatter) [#meta-fields]

Thr top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Meta content field**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Title
      </td>

      <td>
        Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, "AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls." In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). 

        If you're looking for ideas on how to choose a title, browse the titles of similar docs. 

        The title used in the sidebar (left navigation pane) is set in [the nav file](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/update-left-navigation-pane).  
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>type</td>
      <td>For the **basicDoc** template, use **page** or omit `type`. If omitted, the default `type` is `page` and the `basicDoc` template is used.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>template</td>
      <td>The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use **basicDoc** for more pages.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>tags</td>
      <td>Keywords related to your doc. Through some technical wizardry, they generate **Related resources** links in the right nav area. 
        
        Start each topic with a `-` on a new line. 
      
      A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>japaneseVersion</td>
      <td>The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version.</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Document body [#body-field]

The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content.

## Page templates

For most situations, use the **basicDoc** page template. Read on for information about our other page templates.
