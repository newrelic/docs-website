You can't just hit the edit button docs.newrelic.com to make edits to the home page. The page that opens is `index.js`, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files:

- `src/data/homepage.yml` - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles.
- `src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json` - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. 

## Update a link's URL 

Change or add new links using [homepage.yml](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/homepage.yml).

1. In [homepage.yml](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/homepage.yml), search for the link you want to change.
2. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. 

## Add a new tile to the home page

You'll make changes to both [homepage.yml](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/homepage.yml) and [translations.json](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json)

1. On the [translations.json](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json) doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format:

    ```
    "t#": {
            "title": "tile name",
            "description": "Short description."
          },
    ```
    Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well.

2. Save the file.
3. Open [homepage.yml](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/homepage.yml), find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, `- /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster`
4. Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build.
5. Commit, push, PR when you're ready.

## Add a new section to the home page

1. On the [translations.json](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json) page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile:

    ```
    "errors-inbox": {
          "title": "Errors Inbox",
          "description": "A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.",
          "t1": {
            "title": "Introduction to Errors Inbox",
            "description": "How to manage all your monitoring in one place."
          },
    ```

2. When you're done creating the info, save the file.
3. In the [homepage.yml](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/data/homepage.yml) page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on `homepage.yml`.

    ```
    errors-inbox:
      title: Errors Inbox
      description: A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.
      tiles:
        - /docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox
    ```
4. Save, build locally, commit, PR.
