<Callout variant="caution">
  When you delete a document, its content and its redirects will still be available in the GitHub commit history.
</Callout>

To delete a doc:

1. Locate the MDX file of the doc you want to delete.
2. Take care of redirects:
   1. Find the most relevant doc to redirect readers to.
   2. [Add the deleted doc's URL as a redirect](/docs/style-guide/rename-or-redirect-document).
   3. Copy any existing redirects from the deleted doc and add them to the new doc.
3. Delete the doc's title and path from the appropriate nav file.
4. Delete the doc MDX file.
5. Delete the corresponding MDX files from the `src/i18n/content` directory. For each English doc, there is an MDX file for each of the localized languages.
