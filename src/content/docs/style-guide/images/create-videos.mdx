There are many ways to create videos, but here are some tips that will likely apply to a lot of video production projects. 

## Before you start [#before-you-start]

Before you start, talk to the Nerd Bytes team and make sure they're not working on a similar video. 

## Scripting tips [#script-tips]

Try to keep videos under two minutes. If your script is longer than that, consider breaking it up into more than one video. 

You can estimate your video length by doing a leisurely read-through of your script. 

## Tips for recording [#recording-tips]

Tips for using Camtasia to record your screen capture and voice-over audio: 

* Record in a quiet room, using some sort of external microphone (for example, Apple headphones). Don't use the built-in computer microphone. 
* Record several seconds of room tone (the sound of the empty room). This can be used to fill in gaps or cover up noises in the audio. This is better than using silence because going to complete silence can be jarring. 
* You can easily take out pauses during editing: this means you can pause to prepare for the next sentence or section as long as you want.
* Instead of reading the whole thing through multiple times, consider trying to read it once but, for sections you think weren't done well, immediately repeat that section again. This can be easier to edit than doing entire-script takes. 

## Tips for editing [#editing-tips]

Tips for using Camtasia to edit your video: 

* Ensure your project is set to 100% scale. To do this, double click on your video on the timeline and then, in the upper right, make sure the scale reads 100%. When this is lower, it will export low-resolution video. 
* There is an **Add cursor effects** setting that enables highlighting the cursor in the screen capture you've recorded. This is recommended so people can easily see what you're doing on the screen. 
* To split a video for editing purposes, go to a location on the timeline and use Shift+Command+T. (This would be how you split the video to take out a pause, for example.) 
* Use the + and - buttons to zoom in on the timeline to give yourself more granular control over editing a clip. 
* To shorten or lengthen clips, drag the ends of the clips and move them right or left. 
* Use the blur feature to blur sensitive information. Apply a blur effect and size it to the correct size, and then on the timeline arrange its start and end point at the appropriate location. 
* When you're ready to export the video, go to **Share > Advanced export** and export it as an mp4.
