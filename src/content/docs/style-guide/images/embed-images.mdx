A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down.

* If you're not part of the docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).
* If you're a New Relic employee, contact the `@hero` in the documentation Slack channel.

## Add an image [#add]

We want to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in UI screenshots. That's why we recommend that you provide a permalink to a test account. Do not take a screenshot from your New Relic account.

Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image:

* Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance.
* Ensure you follow the [naming and import statement conventions](#naming-and-imports).
* Include a caption with helpful context for the image.
* For screenshot captions, include the path in bold.
* For video captions, include the approximate running time.
* Do not link to an external image file. All images used in docs must be stored in [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website).
* Our default is dark mode. If a subject matter expert provides you with screenshots in light mode, please request new ones in dark mode. If you are unable to get dark mode images, then any screenshot is better than no screenshot at all. 

<Callout variant="important">
  Images are managed a little differently between `.mdx` files (content in `src/content/docs`) and `.md`files  (content in `src/content/whats-new`).

  * For `.mdx` files, images are stored in the `src/images` directory.
  * For `.md` files, such as "What's new" posts, images are stored in individual `images` directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These `images` directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category.
</Callout>

To add or edit an image:

1. Place your image in the relevant directory (usually `src/images` unless you're working with What's New or release notes).

2. Continue with the following procedures to add or edit images:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title={<>Embed image in <InlineCode>.mdx</InlineCode> file</>}>
    <Callout variant="important">
      Markdown image syntax isn't supported for `.mdx` files on the New Relic docs site.
    </Callout>

    To embed an image in an `.mdx` file, you need to take two steps:

    * Insert an image `import` statement near the top of the `.mdx` file. Make sure the import statement has new lines above and below it.
    * Insert the image in the body of the document using the `img` tags.

      Here's a snippet showing the `import` statement and `img` tags:

      ```
      ---
      title: 'Example MDX file'
      ---

      import syntheticsOverviewPage from 'images/synthetics_screenshot-full_overview-page.webp'

      <img
        src={syntheticsOverviewPage}
        title="Synthetics UI overview"
        alt="An image showing an overview of the synthetic monitoring UI"
      />

      Rest of file
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title={<>Embed image in <InlineCode>.md</InlineCode> file</>}>
    <Callout variant="important">
      REACT image syntax (`img`) isn't supported for `.md` files.
    </Callout>

    Use Markdown to embed an image in an `.md` doc, such as a "What's new" post.

    This is the basic structure:

    ```md
    ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE "Image title text")
    ```

    Here's a completed example:

    ```md
    ![An image showing an overview of the synthetic monitoring UI](./images/synthetics_screenshot-full_overview-page.webp 'Synthetics UI overview')
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title={<>Update image in <InlineCode>.mdx</InlineCode> file</>}>
    To update an image:

    1. Delete the original image file in the `src/images` directory.
    2. Place the new image file in the same `src/images` directory.
    3. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file, or update the import statements in the relevant `.mdx` file **and** all localized versions of it.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title={<>Update image in <InlineCode>.md</InlineCode> file</>}>
    To update an image:

    1. Delete the original image file in the corresponding `images` directory.
    2. Place the new image file in the same `images` directory.
    3. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Image naming conventions and import statements [#naming-and-imports]

We follow a standard naming convention for import statements and image filenames. Generally rather than memorize the convention, you should create your image import statement automatically with the `kkimport` Keyboard Maestro macro.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="image-name-convention"
    title="Image filenames"
  >
  An image name consists of three elements separated by underscores:

    * A New Relic capability (such as `apm` or `dashboards`).
    * An image type. This is always one of: `screenshot-full`, `screenshot-crop`, `diagram`, `icon`, and `logo`.
    * A description of the image, separated by hyphens. For example: `transaction-times-chart`.

  Here's an example filename: `apm_screenshot-full_transaction-times-chart.webp`
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="import-variable-convention"
    title="Image variable names in import statements"
  >
  The import statement also contains a variable name. Variable names should be lower camel case, and consist of the capability name followed by the description. Do not include special characters. For example: `apmTransactionTimesChart`
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      className="freq-link"
    id="import-statement-example"
    title="Example import statement"
  >
  Putting it all together, a complete `import` statement looks like this: 

  ```
  import apmTransactionTimesChart from 'images/apm_screenshot-full_transaction-times-chart.webp'
  ```

  The `import` statement always comes at the top of the doc, right after the frontmatter. Separate multiple import statments with an empty line. For example:

  ```jsx
  ---
  title: Create smoother charts with sliding windows
  metaDescription: Explains how to use the SLIDE BY clause with TIMESERIES to smooth out "spiky" charts.
  redirects:
    - /docs/create-smoother-charts-sliding-windows
  ---
  
  import queriesnrqlSlidebyWindowTimeSeries from 'images/queries-nrql_diagram_slide-by-window-time-series.webp'
  
  import queriesnrqlNonSlidingWindowTimeSeries from 'images/queries-nrql_diagram_non-sliding-window-time-series.webp'
  
  import queriesnrqlTimeseriesSpikyNRQLQueryBuilder from 'images/queries-nrql_screenshot-full_timeseries-spiky-NRQL-query-builder.webp'
  
  import queriesnrqlTimeseriesSmoothedWithSlidebyNRQLQueryBuilder from 'images/queries-nrql_screenshot-full_timeseries-smoothed-with-slide-by-NRQL-query-builder.webp'
  
  Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the `SLIDE BY` clause in conjunction with the `TIMESERIES` clause.
  ```

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Write image captions [#labeling]

Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example:

```
---
title: Abbreviated example file
---

import nr1DashboardsImages from 'images/nr1-dashboards.webp'

<img src={nr1DashboardsImages} alt="Dashboards in New Relic" title="Dashboards in New Relic" />

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic.
</figcaption>
```

For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see [Guidelines for explaining images](/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images#identify-images).

## Add an inline image (MDX) [#inline-images-mdx]

To use an inline image:

* Import the image at the top of the file.
* Use the `img` tag in the file.
* Add a class of `inline` to `img`.
* Add any optional height/width in the `style` property.

If the inline image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word `icon` in the text. For example:

```jsx
---
title: Abbreviated example of a file
---

import exampleIcon from 'images/example_icon_example-icon.webp'

Select your app's settings <img src={exampleIcon} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Multiple app names indicator in New Relic" title="Multiple apps name indicator in New Relic" /> icon.
```

## Icons [#icons]

You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs:

* Feather icons (prefixed with `'fe-`).
* New Relic icons (prefixed with `nr-`).
* Logos for third-party products (prefixed with `logo-`).

To see if we already have an icon you need, go to:

* [Feather.js for `docs-website` in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js#L100-L104): These are the Feather icons available in the `docs-website` project but are not included in the Gatsby theme.
* [Gatsby theme for `docs-website` in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/%40newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons): This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites.

You can use any icons you need in the Gatsby theme or Feather. Currently these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons.

### Insert icons as tag attributes [#tag-attributes]

If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with `icon` as in this example:

```
<LandingPageTileGrid>
  <LandingPageTile
    title="AWS Lambda"
    href="/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring"
    icon="logo-aws"
  >
</LandingPageTile>
```

### Insert inline icons [#inline-icons]

If your icon appears inside running text, use the `<Icon>` component. Here are some examples:

* Feather: `<Icon name="fe-database" />`
* New Relic: `<Icon name="nr-tdp" />`
* Logos: `<Icon name="logo-apple" />`

### Install new Feather icons [#feather-icons]

If you don't see the icon you want in either the [Gatsby theme for `docs-website` in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#available-icons) or in the [Feather.js for `docs-website` in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js#L100-L104), you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. You can also ask developers to add the icon you want.

Here's an example of adding a `database` icon:

1. Go to [feathericons.com](https://feathericons.com/).
2. Download the `database` feather icon by clicking on the icon itself.
3. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor.
4. Copy the "guts" of the SVG, which is everything in between the `<svg>` tags. For example, if the SVG is `<svg><path m="1"></path></svg>`, then copy only the `<path m="1"></path>` portion.
5. Open the list of feather icons at `src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js`.
6. Add an entry for `database`, and assign the code from the previous step to it.
7. If the icon has multiple paths, include the `<>` wrapper around it like you see with other icons.
8. Save the `feather.js` file.

The `fe-` prefix gets added automatically. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the icon component; for example, `<Icon name="fe-database" />`.
