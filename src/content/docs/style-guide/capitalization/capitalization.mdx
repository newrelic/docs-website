In general, we only capitalize things when we need to. Over use of capitalization is distracting and limits accessibility for our readers with vision impairment. Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page.

## Use sentence case in headings [#heading_caps]

Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of:

* The first word
* Proper nouns
* Acronyms and abbreviations

**We have some exceptions:**

* If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: [`noticeError`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/notice-error).
* If the heading includes a colon, follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/punctuation/colons#in-titles-and-headings) for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: [APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/apm-error-profiles-troubleshoot-trends).

  Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our [Screenshots and images](/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images/#graphics) document for more information on our image guidelines.

## Products and features [#features]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Item
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        We use title case for products.
      </td>

      <td>
        `Infinite Tracing`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products).
      </td>

      <td>
        `Use transaction traces to...` not `Use Transaction Traces to...`
        
        `Our infrastructure monitoring...` not `Our Infrastructure monitoring...`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## UI elements and UI page paths [#ui]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "350px" }}>
        Item
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI.
      </td>

      <td>
        "From the **Transactions** page, select **Transaction traces** and..."
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages.
      </td>

      <td>
        Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > Transactions > Transaction traces > (select a trace) > Another thing**.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
