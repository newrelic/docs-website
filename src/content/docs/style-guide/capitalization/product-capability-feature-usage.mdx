title: Product, capability, and feature capitalization and usage
metaDescription: Use these guidelines for all content types, including New Relic UI.
---

This page is the definitive resource for capitalizing products, features, and capabilities for use by all New Relic content creators. These guidelines have been vetted by members of legal, content and product marketing, and docs, as well as leaders from around New Relic. Visit the word-nerds slack channel if you have questions about or additions to the list.

In general, the only things that we use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) for are our company name, product/platform name, and a few capabilities and integrations that require it for legal reasons. The following sections also call out first and subsequent uses of terms. First use refers to the first mention in the body copy. It's okay to use the subsequent versions in space-constrained areas such as titles, headers, tables, web navigation, the UI, social media posts, and so on.

Do not use acronyms specific to or coined by New Relic externally; only use industry-recognized acronyms such as APM externally.

## Trademark guidelines

New Relic trademarks are adjectives (brand names) modifying nouns (the generic product type).
* Do not make New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on possessive using apostrophes. For example, use the “functionality of New Relic One” or “the New Relic One functionality” instead of “New Relic One's functionality.”
* Do not pluralize New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on. 
* Do not abbreviate or combine New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on. 
* Do not hyphenate New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on, and do not allow them to break across a page line when used in text. 
* Avoid confusion by clearly separating and identifying New Relic trademarks from other companies' names and/or trademarks. 

These trademark guidelines apply to other companies' trademarked names and products too.

## When to use title case

You must use title case for our trademarked names including our company name plus our product/platform name and a few capability and integration names.

\* Trademarked

### Examples

* New Relic is a registered trademark of New Relic, Inc. It was founded in 2008. We call our employees Relics.
* The New Relic support team can answer all of your questions about New Relic One. They're happy to help.  
* The New Relic One observability platform lets you ingest data from practically any source. New Relic One gives you access to our curated UI experiences like application performance monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and more.
* Optimize code performance and feature planning with access to telemetry data from production and pre-production environments directly in your IDE via the New Relic CodeStream integration.
* New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, cloud-based solution. Infinite Tracing can analyze 100% of your trace data and choose the most actionable data.

## What not to capitalize

Do not capitalize our capability and feature names (what you get with our platform) unless they begin a sentence (and then only capitalize the first word) or are included in the table above. If a capability or feature name includes the name of a trademarked product, then only capitalize the trademarked name (for example, Pixie or Kubernetes).

Feature and capability defined: 

* A feature is an individual experience or element of functionality in the New Relic One platform or a New Relic One capability. 
* A capability is a collection of features that enable a customer to achieve a use case. A capability is considered a superset of features and often tends to be an outside-in term that customers associate with an existing category such as application performance monitoring, applied intelligence, infrastructure monitoring, and log management. In other words, capabilities are the things we'd treat as SKUs if we sold them all separately.

Notes about features and capabilities: 

* These are largely internal terms used so that we can discuss New Relic and its structure more clearly. For public resources, we should attempt to avoid these terms and their distinctions and simply talk about how something works. 
* Note that this use of “capability” is different from how we define “capability” in the [user management space](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#capabilities).

If you don't see a feature or capability in one of the above tables, assume that it is not capitalized.

### Examples

* Application performance monitoring (APM) helps you instantly understand application performance, dependencies, and bottlenecks. APM gives you a complete view of your applications and operating environment.
* Covered entities can now send application, infrastructure, digital experience, and network monitoring data to New Relic One while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
* When you need to correlate log data with other telemetry data, enable logs in context in New Relic One.
* NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. 
* With a quickstart, you can quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources.
