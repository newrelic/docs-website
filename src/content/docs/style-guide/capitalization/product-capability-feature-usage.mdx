title: "Product and capabilities: capitalization, trademarks, and usage"
metaDescription: Use these guidelines for all content types, including New Relic UI.
---

This page is the definitive resource for capitalizing products, features, and capabilities for use by all New Relic content creators. These guidelines have been vetted by members of legal, content design, product marketing, and docs, as well as leaders from around New Relic.

In general, we use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) for our company name, product/platform name, and a few capabilities and integrations that require it for legal reasons. The following sections also call out first and subsequent uses of terms. First use refers to the first mention in the body copy. It's okay to use the subsequent versions in space-constrained areas such as titles, headers, tables, web navigation, the UI, social media posts, and so on. If you're writing UI copy, see our [UI capitalization guidelines](/docs/style-guide/ui-writing/capitalization/).

In general, outside of these product and UI guidelines, use sentence case capitalization.

Do not use acronyms specific to or coined by New Relic externally; only use industry-recognized acronyms such as APM externally.

## Trademarks defined

A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or a combination of the three that identifies a particular product or service. A [trademark](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/what-trademark#:~:text=A%20trademark%20can%20be%20any,both%20trademarks%20and%20service%20marks) is how customers recognize you in the marketplace and distinguish you from your competitors for those goods and services.

A trademark name is the name of a company conducting business. The New Relic trademark name is New Relic, Inc.

## How to use the New Relic brand name

Here are the general trademark guidelines when using the New Relic brand name:

* Do not make New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on possessive using apostrophes. For example, use “New Relic platform functions” or “New Relic functionality” instead of “New Relic's platform functions” or “New Relic's functionality.”
* Do not pluralize New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on.
* Do not abbreviate or combine New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on.
* Do not hyphenate New Relic or its platform, capabilities, and so on, and do not allow them to break across a page line when used in text.
* Avoid confusion by clearly separating and identifying New Relic trademarks from other companies' names and/or trademarks.

Note that it’s generally a best practice to apply these trademark guidelines to other companies’ trademarked names and products too, unless the company’s trademark policies require a different approach.

It’s not necessary to use trademark characters after product names in headings and text on newrelic.com webpages.

## Third-party trademarks

In general, it’s not necessary or recommended to use trademark characters after third-party product names on newrelic.com webpages or documents (including PDFs). New Relic is typically not in the position to know if a particular mark is registered. Assuming a third-party product name or other third-party mark is registered can lead to unintended and undesired consequences for New Relic. Thus, avoid using the ® or ™ symbol unless a third party that New Relic partners or works with specifically requires the use of the symbol as a part of its trademark policy.

In some instances, a third party requires the use of the ® or ™ symbol by contract or through its trademark policy. For example, LEGO. A recent FutureStack event promoted an activity in which a LEGO master would create a LEGO model. In this case, LEGO required that the first occurrence of LEGO in New Relic copy should be followed by ®. For example, "You can win a one-of-a-kind LEGO® model of the New Relic Data Nerd Knuckles."

If a company we're working with has its trademark policy publicly available or has privately provided the policy to New Relic, please consult that policy and follow the company’s policy for use of the ® or ™ symbol.  If you're unsure of whether you need to acknowledge a third-party trademark in your copy, contact Legal in the #suplegal channel in Slack.

## When to use title case

You must use title case for our trademarked names including our company name plus our product/platform name and a few capability and integration names.

This table is kept up to date and is the source of truth for capitalization. Most capability and feature names are lowercase because New Relic is one platform. However, some terms and capabilities are capitalized for trademark or pricing reasons (for example, it's a separate SKU). Note that the use of "capability" here is different than our use of that word in the [user management space](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions).

### Examples

* New Relic is a registered trademark of New Relic, Inc. It was founded in 2008. We call our employees Relics.
* The New Relic support team can answer all of your questions about New Relic. They're happy to help.
* The New Relic observability platform lets you ingest data from practically any source. New Relic gives you access to our curated UI experiences like application performance monitoring, <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, mobile monitoring, and more.
* Optimize code performance and feature planning with access to telemetry data from production and pre-production environments directly in your IDE via the New Relic CodeStream integration.
* New Relic Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, cloud-based solution. Infinite Tracing can analyze 100% of your trace data and choose the most actionable data.

## What not to capitalize

Do not capitalize our capability and feature names (what you get with our platform) unless they begin a sentence (and then only capitalize the first word) or are included in the table above. If a capability or feature name includes the name of a trademarked product, then only capitalize the trademarked name (for example, Pixie or Kubernetes).

Feature and capability defined:

* A feature is an individual experience or element of functionality in the New Relic platform or a New Relic capability.
* A capability is a collection of features that enable a customer to achieve a use case. A capability is considered a superset of features and often tends to be an outside-in term that customers associate with an existing category such as application performance monitoring, alerts, infrastructure monitoring, and <InlinePopover type="logs"/>. In other words, capabilities are the things we'd treat as SKUs if we sold them all separately.

Notes about features and capabilities:

* These are largely internal terms used so that we can discuss New Relic and its structure more clearly. For public resources, we should attempt to avoid these terms and their distinctions and simply talk about how something works.
* Note that this use of “capability” is different from how we define “capability” in the [user management space](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions).

If you don't see a feature or capability in one of the above tables, assume that it is not capitalized.

### Examples

* Application performance monitoring (APM) helps you instantly understand application performance, dependencies, and bottlenecks. APM gives you a complete view of your applications and operating environment.
* Covered entities can now send application, infrastructure, digital experience, and network monitoring data to New Relic while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
* When you need to correlate log data with other telemetry data, enable logs in context in New Relic.
* NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database.
* With a quickstart, you can quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources.

## Capitalization changes to platform components

We used to capitalize our platform components (below). However, we no longer position our platform this way. Check out how we're [positioning our platform](https://newrelic.com/platform) and the recommendations for how to refer to these platform components in the following table.
