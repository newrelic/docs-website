This document describes how to change the title of a document and how to create, edit, and delete redirects. Procedures are the same for both standard docs ("basic pages") and release notes.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Changing titles or updating redirects can create issues with finding content. If you need to change a title or a redirect, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel.

## URL format [#title-url]

A document's URL is based on its filename and filepath in the GitHub repository. 

For example, this is the filename and path for **Rename or redirect a document**:

```
/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document.mdx
```

The URL is: 

```
https://docs.newrelic.com/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document
```

If you change a document's filename or path, make sure to add a redirect to its old URL.

## Change titles [#titles]

To change a document title, change the title being used in the `title` field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc.

If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the `yml` file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use `/src/nav/style-guide.yml`.

## Change anchor links [#anchors]

Wherever possible, do not change the `[#anchor_ids]` of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor `id` is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs.

## Edit redirects [#redirects]

If you change the URL of a doc, make sure you add the old URL to the `redirects` frontmatter section at the top of the doc.
