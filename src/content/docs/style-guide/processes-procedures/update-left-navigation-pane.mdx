Navigation for [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) is stored in `YAML` files located in the [`/src/nav/`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav) directory. Each top-level navigation should have its own configuration file. You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the `develop` branch.

## The configuration file

As an example, here's a snippet of the [`agents.yml`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav/agents.yml) navigation configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. Be sure to imitate the same spacing when you make changes:

```yml
title: Agents
path: /docs/agents
pages:
  - title: Manage APM agents
    path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents
    pages:
      - title: Agent data
        path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data
        pages:
          - title: Real time streaming
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming
          - title: Custom instrumentation
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation
          - title: Agent attributes
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes
          - title: Custom events
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events
          - title: Custom metrics
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics
          - title: Manage errors
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected
          - title: Link Kubernetes
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes
      - title: App naming
        pages:
          - title: Name your application
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application
          - title: Use multiple names for an app
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app
```

## Configuration file options

When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the `.yml` configuration file can have the following properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:200px">Key</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`title`</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>The text that is shown in the navigation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`path`</td>
      <td>&#42;no</td>
      <td>
        <p>The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes.</p>
        <p>
          &#42;Adding a `path` is required to generate auto index page content.
          See [path requirements below](#nav-requirements-for-auto-index-pages).
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`children`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Any sub-navigation nodes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate `.yml` file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Each category has its own `index.md` page (list of pages for that category).
  When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to
  reflect the new information architecture more correctly.
</Callout>

## Add a new top-level nav

To add a brand-new top-level nav, you need to create the necessary `.yml` file and related directories.

1. Add the new directory, sub-directories, and docs to `src/content`.
2. Copy an existing file from the `src/nav` directory or create a new `.yml` nav file from scratch.
3. Customize the new nav file with the list of docs and directories you added.
   <Callout variant="tip">
     You should have at least one level of nesting inside your new directory.
     Otherwise, doc titles in the auto-generated nav pages will render as H2
     headings. For example, `src/content/level-one/level-two/doc` will work,
     while `src/content/level-one/doc` will produce strange formatting.
   </Callout>{' '}
4. Test your build locally to ensure all the menus are working as expected.

If you don't want your new nav to appear on the main landing page, add `rootNav: false` to your `.yml` file. (For an example of this, see `src/nav/style-guide.yml`.)

## Use nav `YAML` to populate page menus

On build we automatically generate a page for each `.mdx` file and an index page for each sub-directory in `src/content` that does not already have an `index.mdx` file and that has at least one `.mdx` or `.md` file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav `YAML` file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content.

If a page path is in more than one nav `YAML` file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of the given page's path.

### Nav requirements

In order to attach nav `YAML` data to a page, you must add the page path somewhere in the most relevant nav `YAML` file. This helps the local nav plugin determine which nav to attach to a given page. It also helps the `<IndexContents />` component know which section to display on auto index pages.

When adding auto index page links to nav `YAML` files, be aware that auto index pages are only created for file directories in `src/content` that contain at least one `.mdx` or `.md` file.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Example">
  If this auto index page is used in `full-stack-observability.yml` and `integrations.yml`, we will attach the `integrations.yml` nav to it because:
  the top level `path` in the `integrations.yml` matches the beginning of the auto index page path:

```
title: Integrations
path: <mark>/docs/integrations</mark>
```

matches this auto index page path:

```
<mark>/docs/integrations</mark>/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list
```

</Callout>

If a page's path does not match any of the top-level paths in the nav `YAML` files it's referenced in (like the above example), the local nav plugin defaults to the first nav `YAML` file it sees. The order is a alphabetical sort of the top-level `title` fields.

For example, if we have an .mdx file with this path that's included in two nav `YAML` files:

```
<mark>/docs/do-all-the-things</mark>/how-to-monitor-everything
```

We can't determine a "true nav" so the plugin would default to attaching the `full-stack-observability.yml` data to the page, because its `title` value is first alphabetically.

```yaml fileName=src/nav/integrations.yml
<mark>title: Integrations</mark>
path: /docs/integrations
```

```yaml fileName=src/nav/full-stack-observability.yml
<mark>title: Full Stack Observability</mark>
path: /docs/full-stack-observability
```
