Navigation for [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) is stored in `YAML` files located in the [`/src/nav/`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav) directory. Each top-level navigation should have its own configuration file. You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the `develop` branch. 

## The configuration file

As an example, here's a snippet of the [`agents.yml`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav/agents.yml) navigation configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. Be sure to imitate the same spacing when you make changes:

```yml
title: Agents
path: /docs/agents
pages:
  - title: Manage APM agents
    pages:
      - title: Agent data
        pages:
          - title: Real time streaming
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming
          - title: Custom instrumentation
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation
          - title: Agent attributes
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes
          - title: Custom events
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events
          - title: Custom metrics
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics
          - title: Manage errors
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected
          - title: Link Kubernetes
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes
      - title: App naming
        pages:
          - title: Name your application
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application
          - title: Use multiple names for an app
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app
```

Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough.

## Configuration file options

When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the `.yml` configuration file can have the following properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:200px">Key</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`title`</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>The text that is shown in the navigation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`path`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>The URL path to the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`children`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Any sub-navigation nodes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate `.yml` file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
Each category has its own `index.md` page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly.
