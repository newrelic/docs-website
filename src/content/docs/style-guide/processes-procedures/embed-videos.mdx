Embed videos as an additional aid for readers when appropriate; for example, tips for installing or using the New Relic user interface, webinars about more complex features, etc.

* New Relic University has its own site: [learn.newrelic.com](https://learn.newrelic.com/).
* Marketing also stores a library of videos at [newrelic.com/resources/videos](https://newrelic.com/resources/videos) and [newrelic.com/resources/webinars](https://newrelic.com/resources/webinars).

Videos are hosted externally and are embedded in the docs site's page, linking to the external source. Official New Relic videos are hosted on [Wistia](//wistia.com). You can also embed YouTube videos, if necessary.
