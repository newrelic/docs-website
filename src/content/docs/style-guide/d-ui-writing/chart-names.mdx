title: Chart names
---

New Relic One lets users create and name their own charts, but it also has some curated charts we provide. The names of these charts need to be clear and descriptive, so users know what they're seeing.

## Basics

* Use clear keywords.
* Provide enough information to explain the purpose of the chart; avoid one-word names.
* Aim for accuracy over consistency. We'd rather have slightly different names for similar charts than follow a naming convention that's perfect for some charts but inaccurate for others.
* Keep names in sentence case.
