title: Emojis
---

Though they may be great for clarifying emotional intent in messages, we want to ensure consistent messaging to all of our customers. Unless specified here or in our rules for iconography, avoid using emojis in UI text.

## Basics

Avoid using emojis in UI text. If you have an urge to use an emoji to put a positive spin on the text you've written (e.g. an error message), consult our rules for voice and tone and rewrite your message until it achieves your goal.

## Email

When communicating with customers via email, avoid using emojis unless they do so first, or if you've already established a relationship with them.

## In-app messaging

When reaching out to customers via an in-app service like Intercom.io, it should be safe to append your message with a simple smiley face if you decide it's appropriate.
