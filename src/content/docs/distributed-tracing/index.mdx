    Distributed traces are essential for software teams who are moving to the cloud and adopting a distributed architecture. That’s because distributed tracing is the best way to quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through various services.

    As part of an end-to-end observability strategy, distributed tracing addresses the challenges of modern application environments. By deeply understanding the performance of every service—both upstream and downstream—your software teams can:

      * Identify and resolve issues to minimize the impact on the customer experience and business outcomes
      * Measure overall system health and understand the effect of changes on the customer experience
      * Prioritize high-value areas for improvement to optimize digital customer experiences
