Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems.

Requests might pass through various services to reach completion, and these services could be in a variety of places: containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, or on-premises. When you can see the path of an entire request across different services, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues.

Distributed tracing collects data as requests travel from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are eventually combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request.

  Here is an example of a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans, and the spans are combined into one distributed trace.

## Control your tracing costs with Core Tracing [#core-tracing]

As you scale distributed tracing, you might want more control over data volume and costs. Core Tracing provides configurable controls to reduce tracing costs by 30-70% while maintaining the visibility you need.

Core Tracing helps you:

* **Reduce costs** by controlling span volume and attributes
* **Fill instrumentation gaps** with lightweight traces
* **Accelerate adoption** with low-cost entry points for new services

You get three independent "dials" to tune your tracing data:

* **Minimal spans tracing:** Reduce span count by 50-70% by filtering which span types get captured
* **Low-granularity tracing:** Reduce span size by 30-45% by limiting attributes to essentials
* **Adaptive sampling rate:** Control how many traces are sampled per minute

These controls work at the service level—you can use full distributed tracing for business-critical services while using Core Tracing for supporting services. For more information, see [Introduction to Core Tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/core-tracing/introduction-core-tracing).
