If you use the telemetry tools Istio, Kamon, OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, or AWS X-Ray, you can get that data into New Relic with our telemetry integrations.

## Sampling considerations [#sampling]

Because distributed systems can generate a lot of trace data, telemetry tools rely on data sampling (filtering). When you install a [telemetry integration](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations) that reports trace data, you'll have an option to enable [Infinite Tracing](https://newrelic.com/products/edge-infinite-tracing).

Choosing Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling in your telemetry tool:

* **Standard installation without Infinite Tracing:** A standard installation assumes you want your telemetry tool to sample trace data before it's sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our Trace API limits, we may also do additional sampling.)
* **Install with Infinite Tracing:** If you choose Infinite Tracing, we assume you set your telemetry tool's sampling to 100%, so that all your trace data is sent to us. The trace observer selects the most important and actionable traces using [tail-based sampling](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#tail-based), and then that data is ingested via our Trace API.

## Set up integrations [#integrations]

To set up your telemetry tool for sending distributed traces to New Relic, follow the instructions for your tool:

* [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start/)
* [Istio](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/new-relics-istio-integration)
* [Kamon](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/kamon-reporter)
* [OpenCensus](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/new-relics-opencensus-integration)
* [AWS X-Ray](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-x-ray-monitoring-integration)
