{/* TODO: Add hero image showing context-preserved trace navigation */}

Intelligent Exemplar transforms how you investigate errors and latency issues by automatically presenting the most relevant traces without losing context from your starting point. Instead of being redirected to generic trace lists, you get prioritized, actionable traces that directly relate to the issue you're investigating.

## What is Intelligent Exemplar? [#what-is-it]

Intelligent Exemplar is an automated trace selection system that maintains context as you drill down from aggregate metrics (like error rates or latency charts) to individual traces. It intelligently ranks and presents traces based on their relevance to the specific behavior you're investigating.

**Key capabilities:**
* Automatic selection of relevant traces from error and latency charts
* Context preservation from APM Summary and Error Inbox
* Prioritized trace lists showing most relevant, non-fragmented traces
* Pattern analysis showing error propagation paths and contribution percentages
* Time window correlation ensuring traces match the investigation period

{/* TODO: Add diagram showing the flow: Chart → Context → Intelligent Selection → Relevant Traces */}

## Common challenges without Intelligent Exemplar [#challenges]

### Loss of context [#loss-of-context]

**Scenario:** You're investigating a latency spike in your APM Summary page. You click on the spike in the latency chart to see traces, but you're redirected to a generic trace list showing all traces in that time period—without any indication of which traces relate to the spike you clicked on.

**Result:** You must manually filter through hundreds or thousands of traces using trial-and-error to find ones that exemplify the latency issue. The context of "investigating a latency spike" is lost.

{/* TODO: Add "before" screenshot showing generic trace list after clicking chart */}

### Misrepresentation of error sources [#misrepresentation]

**Scenario:** In Error Inbox, you click "View related traces" for a specific error occurrence. Instead of seeing the trace(s) that actually contain this error, you're shown a list of all traces from that trace group—many of which may not have the error at all.

**Result:** You waste time examining traces that don't contain the error you're investigating, leading to confusion and delayed resolution.

{/* TODO: Add "before" screenshot showing unrelated traces in error investigation */}

### Manual trial-and-error navigation [#manual-navigation]

**Scenario:** You need to understand which requests are affected by an error, how long the error has been occurring, and whether it impacts specific customer segments or API endpoints.

**Result:** Without automated analysis, you must manually click through dozens of traces, compare attributes, and try to identify patterns—a time-consuming process that requires deep expertise.

## How Intelligent Exemplar solves these problems [#solution]

Intelligent Exemplar addresses each challenge with automated intelligence:

### 1. Context preservation throughout your investigation

When you click on a spike in an error or latency chart, Intelligent Exemplar:
* Captures the time window you selected
* Identifies the behavioral pattern (error type, latency threshold)
* Automatically applies these criteria to trace selection
* Presents only traces that match your investigation context

{/* TODO: Add "after" screenshot showing contextual trace list with filters applied */}

**Example:** Clicking on a 3-minute latency spike at 2:15 PM automatically shows you traces from 2:15-2:18 PM that exceed your service's normal latency threshold, ranked by relevance.

### 2. Intelligent trace prioritization

For any error or latency pattern, Intelligent Exemplar ranks traces by relevance:
* **Most exemplary first:** Traces that best represent the issue
* **Non-fragmented preferred:** Complete traces over partial ones when possible
* **Recent occurrences:** Matches time windows closely to your selection
* **Statistical significance:** Traces with attributes that correlate to the issue

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of prioritized trace list with relevance indicators */}

### 3. Automated pattern analysis and insights

Beyond just showing relevant traces, Intelligent Exemplar provides:
* **Error propagation paths:** Visualize how errors flow through your services
* **Contribution percentages:** See which paths account for most occurrences
* **Affected transaction analysis:** Understand what types of requests are impacted
* **Trigger point identification:** Identify the source of errors or latency

## How Intelligent Exemplar works [#how-it-works]

When you initiate an investigation (e.g., by clicking on an error chart):

1. **Context capture:** System records your starting point, time window, and issue characteristics
2. **Trace analysis:** Backend analyzes all traces in the relevant time period
3. **Relevance scoring:** Each trace is scored based on how well it exemplifies the issue
4. **Prioritization:** Traces are ranked by relevance, completeness, and recency
5. **Presentation:** You're shown a prioritized list with the most relevant traces first
6. **Pattern analysis:** System identifies common attributes and propagation paths

{/* TODO: Add architectural diagram showing the flow */}

This all happens automatically in seconds, requiring no manual configuration.

## Requirements and prerequisites [#requirements]

To use Intelligent Exemplar, you need:

* **Active distributed tracing:** Your services must have [distributed tracing enabled](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/quick-start)
* **APM agent monitoring or OpenTelemetry:** Monitored services sending trace data to New Relic
* **Sufficient trace data:** At least some traces in the time period being investigated
* **Limited Preview access:** Intelligent Exemplar must be enabled for your account

**Supported starting points:**
* APM Summary page - Error chart
* APM Summary page - Latency chart
* Error Inbox - Error count chart
* Error Inbox - Error rate chart
* Error Inbox - Associated distributed trace links

{/* TODO: Update with actual agent version requirements when finalized */}

## When to use Intelligent Exemplar [#when-to-use]

Use Intelligent Exemplar whenever you need to investigate:

* **Error spikes:** Sudden increases in error rates or new error types
* **Latency anomalies:** Slow requests or performance degradations
* **Error context:** Understanding what traces actually contain a specific error
* **Service dependencies:** How errors propagate through your architecture
* **Impact analysis:** Which customers or endpoints are affected by an issue
* **Trend analysis:** Patterns in how issues manifest over time

Intelligent Exemplar is especially valuable when:
* You're new to distributed tracing
* Your system has high trace volume (100k+ traces/day)
* You have complex microservices architectures
* You're under pressure to resolve incidents quickly
* You need to onboard new team members to observability practices
