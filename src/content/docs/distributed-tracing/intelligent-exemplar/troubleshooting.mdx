This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues when using Intelligent Exemplar for trace investigation.

## No traces shown after clicking chart [#no-traces-shown]

**Symptom:** You click on an error or latency spike in a chart, but the traces page shows "No traces found" or an empty list.

### Possible causes [#no-traces-causes]

**1. Distributed tracing not enabled**
* The service doesn't have distributed tracing configured
* APM agent version doesn't support distributed tracing
* Tracing was recently enabled and data isn't flowing yet

**Solutions:**
* Verify [distributed tracing is enabled](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/quick-start) for the service
* Check your APM agent meets [minimum version requirements](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/quick-start#requirements)
* Wait 2-3 minutes for trace data to arrive after enabling

**2. Time window too narrow**
* Selected time range is very short (&lt; 1 minute)
* No traces were sampled in that specific window
* Trace sampling may have missed the exact moment

**Solutions:**
* Expand time selection to 5+ minutes
* Try selecting a slightly wider window around the spike
* Check your [sampling configuration](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling)

**3. Data not yet available**
* Trace data has processing delay (typically 30-90 seconds)
* System is under heavy load causing delays
* Recent chart data not yet ingested

**Solutions:**
* Wait 2-3 minutes and refresh the page
* Select a time window ending 2+ minutes in the past
* Check [New Relic status page](https://status.newrelic.com/) for platform issues

**4. No traces match the issue**
* Error or latency spike didn't produce sampled traces
* Issue affects operations not instrumented for tracing
* Sampling rate too low to capture the issue

**Solutions:**
* Increase [trace sampling rate](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling) if too low
* Verify all relevant services have tracing enabled
* Check for [missing trace data](/docs/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/missing-trace-data)

### Verification steps [#verify-no-traces]

1. **Check if ANY traces exist for this service:**
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM Span
   WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
   SINCE 1 hour ago
   ```
   * If count = 0, tracing isn't working
   * If count > 0, tracing works but filtering may be too restrictive

2. **Verify traces exist in the selected time window:**
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM Span
   WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
   AND timestamp >= 'YOUR_START_TIME'
   AND timestamp <= 'YOUR_END_TIME'
   ```

3. **Check for errors or latency in traces:**
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM Span
   WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
   AND (error.message IS NOT NULL OR duration > 2)
   SINCE 1 hour ago
   ```

## Traces don't match the issue I clicked on [#traces-mismatch]

**Symptom:** The traces shown don't seem relevant to the error or latency spike you clicked on.

### Possible causes [#mismatch-causes]

**1. Sampling gaps**
* The specific requests causing the issue weren't sampled
* Sampling happened to miss the most problematic traces
* Sampling rate too low for the issue volume

**Solutions:**
* Review multiple traces to identify patterns
* Increase sampling rate to capture more of the issue
* Look for common attributes across available traces

**2. Time synchronization issues**
* Service clocks not synchronized
* Timezone mismatches between services
* Clock skew causing incorrect correlation

**Solutions:**
* Verify NTP is configured on all hosts
* Check for clock skew warnings in agent logs
* Adjust time window slightly forward/backward to account for skew

**3. Issue is intermittent or specific**
* Problem affects only certain requests (e.g., specific customer, region, endpoint)
* Traces shown are for same service but different operation
* Issue requires specific attribute values not in all traces

**Solutions:**
* Apply additional filters for the specific condition:
  - Customer ID
  - Geographic region
  - API endpoint
  - User agent
  - Feature flag values
* Use [Attribute Correlation Analysis](/docs/distributed-tracing/attribute-correlation-analysis/introduction-aca) to identify differentiating attributes
* Expand time window to capture more examples

**4. Fragmented traces**
* Traces missing critical spans where issue occurs
* Services not fully instrumented
* Trace context not propagating correctly

**Solutions:**
* Look for "fragmented" indicators on traces
* Verify all services in path have tracing enabled
* Check for [trace configuration conflicts](/docs/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/infinite-tracing-trace-configuration-conflicts)

### Validation steps [#validate-match]

1. **Verify trace timestamps match your selection:**
   * Check trace start time is within selected window
   * Ensure trace end time doesn't extend far beyond window

2. **Confirm traces contain the issue:**
   * For errors: Verify error message/type matches
   * For latency: Check duration exceeds threshold
   * Look at span details, not just trace summary

3. **Compare with manual query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Span
   WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
   AND error.message LIKE '%YOUR_ERROR%'
   AND timestamp >= 'START_TIME'
   AND timestamp <= 'END_TIME'
   LIMIT 100
   ```

## Expected traces are missing [#missing-traces]

**Symptom:** You know certain traces should exist (you saw them elsewhere, or logs show they occurred), but they're not in the Intelligent Exemplar results.

### Possible causes [#missing-causes]

**1. Filtered out by relevance ranking**
* Traces exist but scored low on relevance
* Displaying only top N most relevant traces
* Missing traces less exemplary of the pattern

**Solutions:**
* Scroll down to see more traces (system may show 20-50 by default)
* Adjust sort order (try "by timestamp" to see all chronologically)
* Clear additional filters that may be too restrictive

**2. Sampling decisions**
* Some traces sampled, others not
* Head-based sampling made decisions before issue was known
* Tail-based sampling (if using Infinite Tracing) filtered them out

**Solutions:**
* Review sampling configuration
* Consider using [Infinite Tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing) for better sampling
* Increase sampling rate for critical services

**3. Data retention**
* Traces aged out (typically 8 days retention)
* Investigating very old issue
* Account has custom retention settings

**Solutions:**
* Check when issue occurred vs current date
* Review account [data retention settings](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention)
* Consider increasing retention for trace data if needed

**4. Different trace group**
* Traces in a different service or trace group
* Not connected to the starting service you're viewing from
* Async operations creating separate traces

**Solutions:**
* Start investigation from different service
* Search globally across all services
* Look for related traces using transaction ID or correlation attributes

## Context not preserved from starting point [#context-lost]

**Symptom:** When navigating to traces, filters or selection criteria from your starting point aren't applied.

### Possible causes [#context-lost-causes]

**1. Browser state issues**
* Browser cleared cache/cookies
* Session expired
* JavaScript error prevented context capture

**Solutions:**
* Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
* Check browser console for JavaScript errors
* Try in an incognito/private window
* Update browser to latest version

**2. Navigation method**
* Used back button instead of starting fresh navigation
* Opened in new tab before context was captured
* Link shared bypassed context capture

**Solutions:**
* Always initiate navigation by clicking charts/links directly
* Don't use browser back/forward buttons for investigation
* If sharing with team, share from the traces page (context already applied)

**3. Feature not fully enabled**
* Intelligent Exemplar partially deployed to your account
* A/B test variant without context preservation
* Known issue or limitation

**Solutions:**
* Contact New Relic support to verify feature status
* Check for known issues in [status page](https://status.newrelic.com/)
* Temporarily use manual filtering as workaround

## Trace list doesn't match issue investigated [#list-mismatch]

**Symptom:** The traces shown are sorted oddly, or highly relevant traces appear at the bottom of the list.

### Possible causes [#list-mismatch-causes]

**1. Sort order changed**
* Accidentally clicked a column header
* Sort preference saved from previous session
* Default sort not set to "relevance"

**Solutions:**
* Click "Relevance" column header to sort by relevance score
* Reset to default sort view
* Clear browser cache to reset preferences

**2. Relevance scoring anomaly**
* Edge case confusing the relevance algorithm
* Unusual trace pattern not handled optimally
* Multiple different issues in same time period

**Solutions:**
* Try different sort orders (duration, timestamp)
* Manually review top 10 traces regardless of score
* Apply additional filters to narrow focus
* Report issue to New Relic if consistently incorrect

**3. Complex issue pattern**
* Issue has multiple root causes
* Different traces exemplify different aspects
* No single "most relevant" trace exists

**Solutions:**
* Review multiple high-scoring traces (top 5-10)
* Use [Attribute Correlation Analysis](/docs/distributed-tracing/attribute-correlation-analysis/introduction-aca) to identify patterns
* Focus on propagation path visualization instead of individual traces

## Performance and data availability issues [#performance-issues]

### Slow trace loading [#slow-loading]

**Symptom:** Traces page takes a long time to load or times out.

**Possible causes:**
* Very large number of traces in time window
* Complex filtering on high-cardinality attributes
* System under heavy load
* Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
* Narrow the time window
* Remove complex filters temporarily
* Check network connectivity
* Try during off-peak hours if consistently slow
* Contact support if persistent

### Incomplete pattern analysis [#incomplete-analysis]

**Symptom:** Pattern analysis section shows "Loading..." indefinitely or shows partial results.

**Possible causes:**
* Analysis still processing (can take 10-30 seconds)
* Too many traces to analyze quickly
* Backend service issue

**Solutions:**
* Wait up to 60 seconds for analysis to complete
* Refresh the page if stuck longer than 60 seconds
* Narrow time window to reduce trace volume
* Check [New Relic status page](https://status.newrelic.com/)

### Propagation path not displayed [#no-propagation-path]

**Symptom:** Propagation path visualization doesn't appear or shows error.

**Possible causes:**
* Traces too fragmented to build path
* Services missing from trace context
* Visualization data processing delay

**Solutions:**
* Check if traces are marked as "fragmented"
* Verify all services have distributed tracing enabled
* Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh
* Try viewing individual traces to understand flow manually

## Error messages and their meanings [#error-messages]

### "Intelligent Exemplar not available for this account" [#not-available]

**Meaning:** Your account doesn't have Intelligent Exemplar enabled.

**Solution:** Contact your New Relic Account Team or [support](https://support.newrelic.com) to request Limited Preview access.

### "Insufficient data to provide relevance ranking" [#insufficient-data]

**Meaning:** Too few traces in the selected time period to perform intelligent ranking.

**Solution:**
* Expand time window
* Check trace data is flowing
* Verify sampling rate is adequate

### "Unable to determine issue pattern" [#no-pattern]

**Meaning:** System couldn't identify common patterns across traces.

**Solution:**
* Issue may be too diverse or random
* Try manual filtering by suspected attributes
* Use [Attribute Correlation Analysis](/docs/distributed-tracing/attribute-correlation-analysis/introduction-aca)

### "Some traces may be incomplete" [#incomplete-traces]

**Meaning:** Warning that displayed traces have missing spans.

**Solution:**
* Proceed with investigation but be aware of gaps
* Check why services aren't reporting all spans
* Consider traces marked "complete" more reliable
