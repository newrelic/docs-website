Infinite Tracing requires special configuration of Java Cryptographic Extensions (JCE) for certain older versions of Java. This document provides guidelines on how to configure Java in this case.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For security and performance, New Relic strongly recommends upgrading to the latest Java 8 update. For HotSpot-based JVMs, none of the steps below are required after 8u251.
</Callout>

## When to configure Java Cryptography [#when-configure]

You must follow this process if you meet ALL of the criteria below:

* You are implementing Infinite Tracing
* Your JVM does not support Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN). New Relic has identified that these JVMs do not support ALPN and require configuration:
  * Oracle Java 7
  * Oracle Java 8 prior to update 251
  * OpenJDK Java 8 prior to update 252

    <Callout variant="important">
      New Relic has only confirmed that the JVMs above lack ALPN support. You should confirm with your vendor if ALPN support is present in your JVM.
    </Callout>

## Application Server

If you use Tomcat, WebSphere, Weblogic, or another application server, refer to your application server's documentation about how to add a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) in your application server.

## Configure the export policy for Oracle JVMs [#export-policy]

Older Oracle JVMs require an extra update to allow JCE. Consult [this Oracle TechNote](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jce-all-downloads.html) for downloads and instructions.

## Configuring Conscrypt for HotSpot JVMs [#conscrypt]

New Relic has successfully tested OpenJDK Java 8 with Conscrypt. Complete the following:

1. Download the [appropriate Conscrypt jar](https://github.com/google/conscrypt/#download) for your operating system.
2. Copy the Conscrypt jar to `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`. This directory should already exist, but if it doesn't, look for a directory named `ext` under `JAVA_HOME`.
3. Edit the file `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` .
4. Under the lines that start with `security.provider`, increment the last number, and set the value to `org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider`. For example, if the last entry was `security.provider.10`, add this line:

   ```
   security.provider.11=org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider
   ```

## Finish setting up Infinite Tracing [#return-to-distributed-tracing]

When you finish these preliminary configurations, return to [Language agents: Enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing) to finish setting up Infinite Tracing.
