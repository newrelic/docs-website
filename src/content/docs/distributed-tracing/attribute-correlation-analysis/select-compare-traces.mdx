{/* OUTLINE - EXPAND TO ~1,500 WORDS:

## Before you begin
- Prerequisites check
- Understanding target vs baseline
- Data quality requirements

## Select target trace group (anomalous traces)
### From scatter plot selection
- Click and drag on scatter plot
- Select by latency threshold
- Select by time window
### By filter criteria
- Error type/message filters
- Service filters
- Custom attribute filters
- Duration filters
### Best practices for target selection
- Minimum trace count recommendations
- Time window sizing
- Ensuring representative sample

## Define baseline traces
### Automatic baseline (recommended)
- System selects "all other traces" in time period
- Ensures statistical validity
- When to use automatic
### Manual baseline selection
- Select specific time period
- Select by specific criteria
- When manual selection is better
### Baseline selection best practices
- Baseline should be "known good"
- Similar time window size
- Avoid contaminated baselines

## Initiate correlation analysis
- Click "Analyze attributes" button
- Processing time expectations
- What happens during analysis

## Review selection summary
- Target group summary stats
- Baseline group summary stats
- Overlap warnings
- Recommendations before proceeding

## Common selection patterns
- Before/after deployment comparison
- Peak vs off-peak comparison
- Error vs success comparison
- Geographic region comparison

## Troubleshooting selection issues
- "Not enough traces" errors
- "Groups too similar" warnings
- "Insufficient attributes" messages
