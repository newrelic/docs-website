{/* OUTLINE - EXPAND TO ~1,200 WORDS:

## Selecting meaningful trace groups
- Representative sample sizes
- Avoiding selection bias
- Time window considerations
- Balancing specificity vs breadth

## Choosing appropriate baselines
- "Known good" baseline criteria
- Temporal baseline selection
- Avoiding contaminated baselines
- When to use manual vs automatic

## Managing high-cardinality attributes
- Custom attribute strategy
- Reducing unnecessary cardinality
- Grouping strategies
- When high cardinality helps vs hurts

## Interpreting statistical significance
- Sample size requirements
- Avoiding false positives
- Multiple comparison corrections
- Practical vs statistical significance

## Common investigation patterns
- Error spike pattern
- Gradual degradation pattern
- Intermittent issue pattern
- Post-deployment pattern
- Geographic pattern

## What to avoid
- Too small sample sizes
- Overlapping target/baseline
- Ignoring domain knowledge
- Over-reliance on automation
- Correlation vs causation mistakes

## Advanced analysis techniques
- Multi-dimensional analysis
- Temporal pattern detection
- Cohort analysis
- Integration with other tools

## Performance considerations
- Optimal trace group sizes
- Analysis timeout scenarios
- Caching and reanalysis
- When to use saved analyses

## Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Recording findings
- Creating runbooks from ACA insights
- Sharing analysis results
- Building institutional knowledge
