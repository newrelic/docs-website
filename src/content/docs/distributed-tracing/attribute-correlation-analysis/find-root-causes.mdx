{/* OUTLINE - EXPAND TO ~1,500 WORDS:

## Understanding the intelligent summary
- What the summary provides
- Confidence scoring
- Multiple hypothesis handling

## Identify probable triggers
### Reading root cause recommendations
- Primary suspects
- Contributing factors
- Unlikely causes
### Confidence indicators
- High confidence (>80%)
- Medium confidence (50-80%)
- Low confidence (<50%)
- When to investigate anyway
### Reasoning explanations
- How ACA determined the cause
- Statistical basis
- Supporting evidence

## Read behavioral differences
### Target vs baseline comparison
- Key distribution differences
- Magnitude of differences
- Practical significance vs statistical
### Attribute value distributions
- Normal ranges
- Anomalous ranges
- Overlap analysis
### Significant variations
- What threshold is "significant"
- Context-dependent interpretation
- Domain knowledge integration

## Follow investigation recommendations
- Prioritized investigation steps
- Which services to check first
- Related metrics to examine
- Code/config areas to review

## Perform iterative analysis
### Refine trace selection
- Narrow down based on findings
- Remove outliers
- Focus on specific cohorts
### Narrow down attributes
- Exclude confirmed non-factors
- Deep-dive on suspects
- Add custom attributes
### Test hypotheses
- Validate findings with additional data
- A/B testing insights
- Controlled experiments

## Real-world examples
### Example 1: Latency investigation walkthrough
- Initial selection
- ACA results
- Following the investigation path
- Root cause confirmation
- Resolution
### Example 2: Error root cause analysis
- Error pattern observed
- ACA analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Fix implementation
- Verification
### Example 3: Performance degradation
- Symptoms
- ACA insights
- Multi-factor root cause
- Remediation strategy

## Validation and confirmation
- How to verify ACA findings
- Testing the hypothesis
- Monitoring after fixes
- Confirming resolution
