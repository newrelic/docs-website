APM agents can filter which spans get sent to New Relic, reducing your distributed tracing data volume by 50-85%. You control which span types are captured—removing in-process spans, reducing attributes, and compressing duplicates—while maintaining complete service-to-service visibility.

## Before you begin [#before-you-begin]

Make sure you have:

* **APM agent monitoring:** This only works with New Relic APM agents (Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP)—not OpenTelemetry
* [Distributed tracing enabled](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/quick-start) on your services
* Agent versions that support span filtering (see [requirements](#requirements) below)
* Permission to modify agent configuration files (YAML) or set environment variables
* A plan for which services to configure (we recommend starting with non-critical services)

<Callout variant="tip">
  Test span filtering on a development or staging environment first to understand the impact before applying to production.

## How span types work [#span-types]

To understand MST, you need to know about the three types of spans in distributed tracing:

### Entry spans

The first span in a service's part of the trace. This represents the incoming request to your service.

**Example:** An HTTP request arriving at your API service.

### Exit spans

Spans that represent calls from your service to downstream services or external resources.

**Examples:**
* HTTP calls to other microservices
* Database queries
* Cache operations
* External API calls

### In-process spans

Spans that represent internal method calls within your service. These show the detailed execution path inside your code.

**Examples:**
* Individual function calls
* Internal service layers
* Business logic methods

## Span filtering configuration options [#span-filter-options]

APM agents provide three configuration levels to reduce span data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        Configuration
      </th>
      <th>
        What gets captured
      </th>
      <th>
        Typical span reduction
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **All spans** (default)
      </td>
      <td>
        Entry spans + exit spans + in-process spans
      </td>
      <td>
        0% (baseline)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Option 1**
      </td>
      <td>
        Entry spans + exit spans
        (removes in-process spans)
      </td>
      <td>
        50-80%
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Option 2**
      </td>
      <td>
        Entry spans + exit spans with reduced attributes
        (Option 1 + removes most attributes)
      </td>
      <td>
        60-75%
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Option 3**
      </td>
      <td>
        Entry spans + unique exit spans with reduced attributes
        (Option 2 + compresses duplicate calls)
      </td>
      <td>
        70-85%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These options are sequential—Option 2 includes all of Option 1's reductions plus attribute reduction, and Option 3 includes both previous options plus duplicate span compression. Option 3's compression means if your service makes multiple identical calls to the same downstream service, only the first call gets reported as a span, preserving the service-to-service relationship while reducing redundant data.

## Configure span filtering [#configure]

Choose your agent language to see configuration instructions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="java"
    title="Java agent"
  >
    To configure span filtering for your Java application, add the `span_events.span_type_filter` setting to your `newrelic.yml` configuration file.

    **Configuration file approach:**

    1. Open your `newrelic.yml` file (typically in your application's root directory).
    2. Under the `distributed_tracing` section, add the `span_events` configuration:

    ```yml
    distributed_tracing:
      enabled: true
      span_events:
        span_type_filter: minimal  # Options: all, entry_exit, minimal
    ```

    3. Save the file and restart your Java application.

    **Environment variable approach:**

    Set the environment variable before starting your application:

    ```bash
    export NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_SPAN_TYPE_FILTER=minimal
    ```

    **Configuration values:**
    * `all`: Capture all span types (default—no filtering)
    * `entry_exit`: Option 1—Capture entry and exit spans only (removes in-process spans)
    * `minimal`: Option 3—Capture entry spans and unique exit spans (includes Option 1 + compresses duplicates)

## Verify span filtering is working [#verify]

After configuring span filtering, verify it's working correctly:

### Check span counts

Run this NRQL query to see if span volume has decreased:

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM Span
WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
SINCE 1 day ago
COMPARE WITH 1 day ago
```

You should see a reduction of 40-70% depending on your configuration.

### Verify span types

Check which span types are being captured:

```sql
SELECT count(*),
       filter(count(*), WHERE span.kind = 'server') as 'Entry Spans',
       filter(count(*), WHERE span.kind = 'client') as 'Exit Spans',
       filter(count(*), WHERE span.kind = 'internal') as 'In-Process Spans'
FROM Span
WHERE entity.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME'
SINCE 30 minutes ago
```

* **Entry and exit only config:** You should see entry and exit spans, but in-process spans should be 0
* **Minimal config:** You should see entry spans and reduced exit spans

### Check trace completeness

Ensure your traces still show complete service-to-service flows:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > Distributed tracing**.
2. Select a recent trace that includes your service with span filtering configured.
3. Verify you can still see:
   * All services in the request path
   * Service-to-service connections
   * Request flow from start to finish

## Troubleshoot issues [#troubleshoot]

### Configuration not taking effect

**Problem:** You configured span filtering but span counts haven't changed.

**Solutions:**

1. Verify you restarted your application after configuration changes.
2. Check agent logs for configuration errors:
   ```bash
   grep -i "span_type_filter\|minimal\|entry_exit" /path/to/agent.log
   ```
3. Confirm your agent version supports span filtering (see [requirements](#requirements)).
4. Validate configuration syntax matches your agent's format exactly.

### Traces appear incomplete

**Problem:** Traces show gaps or missing services after enabling span filtering.

**Solutions:**

1. Span filtering only affects span volume, not trace context propagation. If traces are incomplete, check:
   * Distributed tracing is enabled on all services
   * Trace context headers are propagating correctly
   * No proxies or middleware are stripping headers

2. Verify the "missing" services aren't filtered out by [trace sampling](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#sampling).

### Can't see service-to-service calls

**Problem:** After enabling minimal config, you can't see calls between specific services.

**Solutions:**

1. Check if the downstream service is instrumented with distributed tracing.
2. Verify exit spans are being captured (query for `span.kind = 'client'`).
3. If using "minimal" config, unique exit spans should still appear—duplicate calls to the same service are compressed but the first call is captured.
