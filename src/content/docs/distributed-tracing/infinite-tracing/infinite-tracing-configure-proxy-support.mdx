For Infinite Tracing, you can supply an optional proxy configuration if outbound traffic needs to flow through a proxy before reaching a trace observer. The language agents that support this are listed below.

<Callout variant="important">
  **Prerequisites:** Before configuring Infinite Tracing settings, ensure that Infinite Tracing has been officially enabled for your account by New Relic. This is a controlled-access feature. If you're unsure whether you have access, contact your New Relic Account Team or [New Relic Customer Support](https://support.newrelic.com).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important">
  In order for a proxy to work with Infinite Tracing, it needs to support the HTTP/2 protocol rather than standard HTTP/1.1. Consult your proxy documentation to determine if this support is available.
</Callout>

## Go

Specify the proxy address with the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` (or their corresponding lowercase versions).

## Java

The Java agent gRPC implementation automatically uses the standard JVM proxy properties as noted in the Java Networking Properties documentation. An example system property configuration may look like this:

```
-Dhttps.proxyHost=<proxy-host> -Dhttps.proxyPort=443
```

If your application is already using a proxy, these properties may already be set, in which case gRPC should automatically route Infinite Tracing data through the proxy.

## .NET [#dot-net]

The proxy address can be specified by the `https_proxy` environment variable. (.NET Agent version 10.6.0 and earlier also support using the `grpc_proxy` environment variable.) The environment variable name can be uppercase or lowercase when running on Windows, but must be lowercase on Linux.

## Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby [#node-php-python-ruby]

The proxy address can be specified by the environment variables `GRPC_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`. These variables are checked in order, and the first one that has a value is used.
