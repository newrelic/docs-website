For Infinite Tracing, you can supply an optional proxy configuration if outbound traffic needs to flow through a proxy before reaching a trace observer. The language agents that support this are listed below.

<Callout variant="important">
  In order for a proxy to work with Infinite Tracing, it needs to support the HTTP/2 protocol rather than standard HTTP/1.1. Consult your proxy documentation to determine if this support is available.
</Callout>

## Go

Specify the proxy address with the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` (or their corresponding lowercase versions).

## Java

The Java agent gRPC implementation automatically uses the standard JVM proxy properties as noted in the Java Networking Properties documentation. An example system property configuration may look like this:

```
-Dhttps.proxyHost=<proxy-host> -Dhttps.proxyPort=443
```

If your application is already using a proxy, these properties may already be set, in which case gRPC should automatically route Infinite Tracing data through the proxy.

## .NET [#dot-net]

.Net is not supported.

## Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby [#node-php-python-ruby]

The proxy address can be specified by the environment variables `GRPC_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`. These variables are checked in order, and the first one that has a value is used.
