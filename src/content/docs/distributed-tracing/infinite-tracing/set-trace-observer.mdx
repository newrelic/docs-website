If you're following the [Enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/overview-enable-distributed-tracing) procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer.

A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api), which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest.

  This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see [Intro to distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing).

## Set up the trace observer [#set-up]

Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points:

* With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see [Enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/overview-enable-distributed-tracing).
* To avoid [configuration conflict issues](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/infinite-tracing-trace-configuration-conflicts), you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing.

To set up a trace observer:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), and click **Apps**. Under **Your apps**, click **New Relic Edge**.
2. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled.
3. If no trace observers are already present, click **New trace observer** to add one, fill out the information, and click **Create**.

   <Callout variant="important">
     Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, youâ€™ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers.
   </Callout>
4. Under the **Endpoints** dropdown:
   * Copy the **For other integrations** endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
   * If you're enabling a [language agent](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing), also copy the **For language agents** value and have it ready: this will be referred to as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST</var>.
5. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api): this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works.

         If you're using Zipkin-format data, see [Send Zipkin payload](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/report-zipkin-format-traces-trace-api#send-zipkin-curl).
       </Callout>

       This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named `Test Service A`.

       To send this sample request:

       1. Get the [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) for the account you want to report data to and have it ready.
       2. Copy the following `curl` request into a text editor:

          ```
          curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "Api-Key: <var>$YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>" \
            -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \
            -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \
            -X POST \
            -d '[
                {
                    "common": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "environment": "staging"
                    }
                    },
                    "spans": [
                    {
                        "trace.id": "123456",
                        "id": "ABC",
                        "attributes": {
                            "duration.ms": 12.53,
                            "host": "host123.example.com",
                            "name": "/home",
                            "service.name": "Test Service A"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "trace.id": "123456",
                        "id": "DEF",
                        "attributes": {
                            "duration.ms": 2.97,
                            "host": "host456.example.com",
                            "error.message": "Invalid credentials",
                            "name": "/auth",
                            "parent.id": "ABC",
                            "service.name": "Test Service B"
                        }
                    }
                    ]
                }
                ]' \
          '<var>$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>'
          ```
       3. Insert your own values into the `curl` request:

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>
                  Value
                </th>

                <th>
                  Description
                </th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <var>
                    $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
                  </var>
                </td>

                <td>
                  Replace this with your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  <var>
                    $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL
                  </var>
                </td>

                <td>
                  Replace this with the **For other integrations** endpoint value you copied in a previous step.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
       4. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it.
       5. The test should return `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted`, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues:
          * Confirm that you used the [**For other integrations** endpoint](#endpoints) value.
          * Confirm you're using single quotes around <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
          * Check that you're using the correct API key.
       6. If your test returned `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted`, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute `service.name = Test Service A` ([here's a link for that query](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/distributed-tracing-nerdlets.distributed-tracing?launcher=eyJ0aW1lUmFuZ2UiOnsiYmVnaW5fdGltZSI6bnVsbCwiZW5kX3RpbWUiOm51bGwsImR1cmF0aW9uIjoxODAwMDAwfSwiJGlzRmFsbGJhY2tUaW1lUmFuZ2UiOnRydWV9&pane=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)). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace.

6. (Optional) There are several ways to [configure Infinite Tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing). This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures.
7. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling:

   * [Language agents](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-agents)
   * [Third-party telemetry integrations](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-integration) (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others)
   * [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api): once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application.

## Trace observer endpoints [#endpoints]

In the trace observer UI, there's an **Endpoints** dropdown. When [setting up the trace observer](#set-up), we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values:

* **For language agents**: This value is referenced in our code examples as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST</var>. This is used for [configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-agents).
* **For other integrations**: This value is referenced in our code examples as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>. This is used for configuring our [telemetry integrations](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing) and for sending data via the [Trace API](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api/) (including sending [sample payloads](#sample-payload)).
