With the necessary [security and access set up](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) you can create, manage, and revoke publicly accessible live dashboard URLs using queries and mutations in [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), 
You can also do it  from the [New Relic UI](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashbords-externally).

<Callout variant="caution">
  Anyone with the unique link will be able to view the information on the shared dashboard or chart. Share information carefully and in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures.
</Callout>

For creating, updating, or revoking a publicly accessible live dashboard URL from NerdGraph, you need the GUID of the dashboard you want to share.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. From the header, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon.
4. Copy the entity guid (GUID) of the dashboard.

## Create a live dashboard URLs [#create-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]

To create a live dashboard URL:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * Mutation: `dashboardCreateLiveUrl`
  * Parameter: The dashboard GUID
  * Response: `url`

  ```
  mutation CreatePublicLink {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(guid: "enter the dashboard GUID") {
      url
    }
  }

  ```
The live dashboard URL appears in response as following. You can share this URL with anyone you want to share the dashboard with.

  ```
  https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/<public_link_id>

  ```
The `<public_link_id>` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to update or revoke the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content update in the dashboard on New relic platform reflects in the shared dashboard page.
</Callout>

## Update the expiration date [#update-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]

Make sure you have the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to modify the shared dashboard URL. To update the expiration duration:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * Mutation: `dashboardUpdateLiveUrl`
  * Parameter: The ID of the shared dashboard (Copy it from the shared dashboard URL)
  * Options: The updated expiration duration in seconds
      * Minimum value: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
      * Maximum value: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
      * Default value: 2592000 seconds (30 days)

  ```
  mutation UpdatePublicLink{
        dashboardUpdateLiveUrl(
          id:"enter the public link ID"
          options: { ttl: "updated duration in seconds" }
        ) {
          title
          url
        }
  }

  ```
The URL appears in response as following. Now the URL will expire after the updated duration.

  ```
  https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/<public_link_id>

  ```

## Revoke a live dashboard URL [#revoke-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]
Depending upon the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can either revoke the links only you have created or the links created by all the users in the account. 
To revoke a shared dashboard URL:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * Mutation: `dashboardRevokeLiveUrl`
  * Parameter: The ID of the shared dashboard (Copy it from the shared dashboard URL)

  ```
  mutation {
    dashboardRevokeLiveUrl(id: "<public_link_id>") {
      id
    }
  }

  ```
The shared dashboard URL is now revoked and the unique link will no longer be accessible. The response appears as following:

  ```
  {
    "data": {
      "dashboardRevokeLiveUrl": {
        "id": "<public_link_id>" //the one you passed to the mutation
      }
    }
  }

  ```
## List all shared dashboard URLs [#list-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]
Depending upon the [permission](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role), you can get the list of links you have created or the links created by all the users in the account. To get the list of shared dashboard URLs:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) as following:
  * Query: `dashboard`
  * Response: `liveUrls`

  ```
  {
      actor {
        user {
          name
        }
          dashboard {
          liveUrls(filter: {type: DASHBOARD}) {
            liveUrls {
              createdAt
              type
              uuid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

  ```

  The list of the shared dashboard URLs appears in response.
