Admin users create API keys for others using NerdGraph to support automation, ensure governance compliance, and facilitate provisioning processes. To view the API key upon creation, admin users must be enrolled in a special role that permits reading the key only at creation time.

As an <DNT>**[Authentication Domain Manager](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more)**</DNT>, you can configure this role for the admin in the following two ways:

  <TabsBar>
    <TabsBarItem id="using-ui">Configure from the <DNT>**Access Management**</DNT> page</TabsBarItem>
    <TabsBarItem id="using-nerdgraph">Configure using NerdGraph</TabsBarItem>
  </TabsBar>
  <TabsPages>
    <TabsPageItem id="using-ui">
      Configure the role for admin users from the <DNT>**Access Management**</DNT> page as follows:
        1. Navigate to **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Access Management > Groups**.
        2. For an existing admin group, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Manage group access**</DNT>. Alternatively, click <DNT>**Create new group**</DNT> and follow the on-screen instructions to assign a name to the new group, and add admin users as members.
        3. To grant access to the users in the group to read other users' API keys, under <DNT>**Administrative settings**</DNT>, select <DNT>**organization.read.other_users_api_keys**</DNT>.
    </TabsPageItem>
    <TabsPageItem id="using-nerdgraph">
    You can use [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to configure the role for admin users as follows. To understand how to manage user groups and its requirements, refer [NerdGraph tutorial: Manage user groups](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups).

    1. Go to <DNT>[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Apps > NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)</DNT>.
    2. To access <DNT>**Query Builder**</DNT>, submit your [API user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key). You can create a new key from the [API Key UI](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys).
    3. Query for an existing [user group](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#query-groups) where admin users are already members, or [create a new group](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#create-group). Save the group ID for later use.
    4. If you have created a new group, [add admin users to the group](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#add-users).
    5. To fetch your organization ID, run the following query:
        ```graphql
        {
          actor {
            organization {
              id
              name
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        Save the organization ID for later use.
    6. To create a new custom role that enables admins to read other users' API keys, run the following mutation with the fetched organization ID, permission ID: `[12822]`, and a role name:
        ```graphql
          mutation {
            customRoleCreate(
              container: {id: "<your-org-id>", type: "organization"}
              name: "API Key Manager"
              permissionIds: [12822]
              scope: "organization"
            ) {
              id
            }
          }
        ```
        Save the generated role ID for later use.

    7. To add the custom role to the group, run the following mutation with the group ID and the generated role ID:
        ```graphql
        mutation {
          authorizationManagementGrantAccess(
            grantAccessOptions: {
              organizationAccessGrants: { roleId: "<role-id>"},
              groupId: "<group-id>"
            }
          ) {
            roles {
              id
              name
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        You can [query existing roles](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#query-roles) for the group to verify the role assignment.
    </TabsPageItem>
  </TabsPages>
</Tabs>

After configuring the role, the admin users can create and read API keys for other users using NerdGraph. As an admin with enabled role, run the following mutation with an account ID, name for the key, and user ID of a user to create the key.
```graphql
mutation {
  apiAccessCreateKeys(
    keys: {user: {
        accountId: <account-id>, 
        name: "API Manager created user key", 
        userId: <user-id-of-user-to-create-key-for>
        }
    }
  ) {
    createdKeys {
      id
      key
      name
      obfuscatedKey
      type
    }
  }
}
```
In the response you can read the full key. This key is fully readable only at the time of creation. Refer to the [recommendations](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#security-practices) for managing the API keys securely.
