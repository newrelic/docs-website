<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

With New Relic, you can enhance New Relic AI agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by associating your documentation, runbooks, incident retros, and even source code with your services. This process gives New Relic AI better insight into issues with your system. The tutorial outlines how to obtain your organization ID, create a RAG tool, and add your documents to the platform using the Blob API.

After adding your documents, you will create a relationship to associate them with the RAG tool. You can then verify your configuration by querying the relationships between the RAG documents and the RAG tool. The final step is to query the RAG tool itself to retrieve relevant, indexed information.

To learn more about the knowledge connector, refer to [New Relic AI Knowledge connector](/docs/agentic-ai/knowledge-integration/overview).

<Callout variant="important">
 Before performing the following steps, ensure that you have "Org Product Admin" permissions.

To start indexing your content and benefit from the knowledge connector with New Relic AI, follow these mentioned steps:

## Task 1: Create your RAG tool [#create-your-rag-tool]

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id ="get-started" title ="Obtain your organization ID">

Organization ID uniquely identifies your account and ensures that any RAG tool you create, documents you upload, or relationships you establish are associated with your organization in New Relic. 

Organization ID is required to perform mutations and queries in NerdGraph when setting up and managing RAG tools and documents. Run the following query and keep the organization ID handy for later steps.

### Sample query
```graphql
{
  actor {
    organization {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
</Collapser>
<Collapser id = "create-rag-tool" title = "Create a RAG tool">

A RAG tool acts as a specialized container for organizing related documents and resources in New Relic. A clear name and accurate description for your RAG tools helps the LLM select the right tool for each prompt, ensuring relevant and context-aware responses.

To create a new RAG tool in your New Relic account, run the following `entityManagementCreateRagTool` mutation:

1. Make sure to replace `${ORGANIZATION_ID}` with your actual organization ID obtained in the previous step.
2. If successful, you'll receive an `id` for your RAG tool.

        <tr>
            <td>`scope`</td>
            <td>Object</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>An object defining the context in which the tool will be created.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`scope.id`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>The unique ID of your organization (`${ORGANIZATION_ID}`).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`scope.type`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>The type of the scope, which must be `ORGANIZATION`.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Sample mutation
```graphql
mutation {
  entityManagementCreateRagTool(
    ragToolEntity: {
      description: "Runbooks for resolving incidents with APIs",
      name: "API Runbooks",
      scope: {id: `${ORGANIZATION_ID}`, type: ORGANIZATION}
    }
  ) {
    entity {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

You should save the `id` returned as you'll need it in later steps to link documents to the tool, verify relationships, and query the tool for relevant information in New Relic.
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Task 2: Index your documents [#index-your-documents]

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id = "upload-document" title = "Upload a document via the Blob API">

<Callout variant="important">
 All indexed documents are visible to all users within your organization. Make sure the documents you index comply with your internal policies, and do not upload sensitive or private data.
</Callout>

### The Blob API and its purpose
The Blob API is a New Relic service designed for uploading files, such as documentation and runbooks, to your account. NerdGraph is optimized for structured data queries and mutations and not for efficient transfer of files, so the Blob API is required for uploading documents.

### Authentication requirements
You need a valid New Relic API key with permissions to upload documents. To get the API key for uploading a document to New Relic using the Blob API:

1. Log in to your [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/) account.
2. Create and manage your API keys from the [API keys UI page](https://one.newrelic.com/administration/api-keys).
3. Click **Create a key**, and fill the required details (or use an existing one with the required permissions).
4. Click **Create a key** and copy the generated key (it'll look like NRAK-XXXXXXXXXX).

Here's an example of how to upload a document using a `curl` `bash` command:

     -H 'Api-Key: NRAK-XXXXXXXXXX' \
     -H 'NewRelic-Entity: {"name": "Runbooks for API service" }' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d @incidents.json
```

### Sample response

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Response</th>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>

            <td>`entityGuid`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>The unique identifier for the uploaded RAG document.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`blobVersionEntity`</td>
            <td>Object</td>
            <td>Represents the version of the uploaded blob.</td>

  "blobVersionEntity": null
}
```
### Next steps

After uploading your document, it is indexed and becomes available for New Relic AI to search and retrieve. You must save the `entityGuid` from the response to create a relationship with your RAG tool or to query the document in NerdGraph.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id = "view-the-rag-document-entity-represented-in-nerdgraph" title = "View the RAG document entity represented in NerdGraph"> 

After a document is uploaded via the Blob API, running this query confirms that the upload was successful and that the document has been properly registered as a RAG document entity with its own unique identifier and properties.

#### Input parameters

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter Name</th>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Is it Required?</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`id`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>The unique GUID of the RAG document to be retrieved.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Sample query

In the query below, replace the `${RAG_DOCUMENT_GUID}` placeholder with the `entityGuid` you received in the previous step.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    entityManagement {
      entity(
        id: `${RAG_DOCUMENT_GUID}`
      ) {
        ... on EntityManagementRagDocumentEntity {
          id
          name
          blob {
            url
          }
          type
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return the following details about your RAG document:

- `id`: The unique ID of the RAG document.
- `name`: The name of the RAG document.
- `blob { url }`: The URL to access the uploaded document.
- `type`: The type of the entity, which in this case is `EntityManagementRagDocumentEntity`.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id = "create-a-relationship-between-the-rag-document-and-the-rag-tool" title = "Create a relationship between the RAG tool and the RAG document">

Now that you've created a RAG tool, uploaded your document, and verified that the upload was successful, the next step is to associate the RAG tool and the RAG document thereby making your document searchable and usable by New Relic AI. To do this, run the `entityManagementCreateRelationship` mutation:

1. Replace `${RAG_DOCUMENT_GUID}` with the `entityGuid` from the response of the document upload via the Blob API.
2. Replace `${RAG_TOOL_GUID}` with the `id` from the response of the RAG tool creation mutation.
