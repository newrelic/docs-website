You can use our NerdGraph API to make [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) queries. 

## Overview of querying with NerdGraph [#overview]

You can run NRQL queries using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) in the UI, or you can use our NerdGraph API. NerdGraph gives you the ability to do some things you can't do from the UI, such as [query across multiple accounts](#cross-account-query), and run [asynchronous queries](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial).

## Requirements [#requirements]

* All [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) can query data for the accounts they have access to. If you can't query via NerdGraph, it may be because you're lacking [access to that account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts). 
* All queries are subject to [NRQL query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries)

## Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph [#basic-queries]

To make basic NRQL queries using NerdGraph, there are two main requirements: 

* You must pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object
* You must include the `results` field in your query

For example, to get a count of all [transaction events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-event-attributes-insights#transaction-event) in the last hour, you'd run the following query, specifying your [New Relic account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id).

```graphql
{
   actor {
      account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO") {
            results
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This query example would return a result like this:

```graphql
{
   "data": {
      "actor": {
         "account": {
            "nrql": {
               "results": [
                 {
                  "count": 1000
                 }
                ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Looking for details on how to write NRQL queries? See [the NRQL docs section](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql).

## Cross-account queries [#cross-account-query]

With NerdGraph, you can run a query across more than one account, which you can't do in the query builder. You'll need the [account IDs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id) for the accounts you want to query. 

Here's an example of running a cross-account NRQL query: 

```graphql
{ 
   actor {
      nrql(accounts: [ACCOUNT_ID_1, ACCOUNT_ID_2, ACCOUNT_ID_3], 
      options: {}, 
      query: "YOUR_NRQL_QUERY", 
      timeout: 70) 
         {   results}  
   }  
}
```

For how to create a dashboard with data from multiple accounts, see [the NerdGraph dashboard tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-dashboards#cross-account). 

## Create embeddable charts [#embeddable-charts]

In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of [transaction](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-event-attributes-insights#transaction-event), you can create a [chart](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-types) that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add `TIMESERIES` to your query with `embeddedChartUrl`:

```graphql
{
   actor {
      account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES") {
            embeddedChartUrl
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response:

```graphql
{
   "data": {
      "actor": {
         "account": {
            "nrql": {
               "embeddedChartUrl": "https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same [embedded chart rules](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/share-your-data/embed-charts-external-webpages#rules) as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a `chartType` argument to `embeddedChartUrl`.

## Suggested facets [#suggest-facets]

When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the `suggestedFacets` field to return suggested attributes for use in [faceted NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="suggested-facet-rules"
    title="Rules governing suggested facets"
  >
    Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested:

    * **Built-in suggestions.** Each [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#event) comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity.
    * **Usage-based suggestions.** Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes.
    * **Role restriction.** [Restricted users](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles) do not have access to account-related facet suggestions.

      To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, [contact Support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/find-help-or-file-support-ticket#support_tickets).

  <Collapser
    id="example-suggested-query"
    title="Example of returning suggested attributes"
  >
    Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting [transaction](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-event-attributes-insights#transaction-event) counts. The response suggests the `host` attribute. Faceting by `host` can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts.

    ```graphql
    {
       actor {
          account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
             nrql(query: "<a href="/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#state-select">SELECT</a> count(*) from <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-event-attributes-insights#transaction-event">Transaction</a> <a href="/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timeseries">TIMESERIES</a>") {
                suggestedFacets {
                   attributes
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```

    This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this:

    ```graphql
    {
       "data": {
          "actor": {
             "account": {
                "nrql": {
                   "suggestedFacets": [
           	          "attributes": ["host"]
                   ]
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
