With the necessary [security and access set up](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) you can create, manage, and revoke publicly accessible live dashboard URLs using queries and mutations in [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), 
You can also do it from the [New Relic UI](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#dashboard).

<Callout variant="caution"> If a shared dashboard is not password-protected, anyone with the live URL can access and view all the information it contains. To prevent unwanted access, ensure you [create password-protected URLs](#create-dashboard-url-with-psswd-nerdgraph) or [enable password protection for existing shared URLs](#enable-password-dashboard-url-nerdgraph).</Callout>


For creating, updating, or revoking a publicly accessible live dashboard URL from NerdGraph, you need the GUID of the dashboard you want to share.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com//dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**<Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> > Metadata**</DNT>, and copy the entity GUID of the dashboard.

<CollapserGroup>


<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url-nerdgraph" title="Create an URL without password protection">
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardCreateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `GUID`: Enter the entity GUID of the dashboard.
  * `Options`(optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
          * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
          * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
          * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)
  * `url`: Select this to get the live dashboard URL in the response.
  * Select any other fields you want in the response.

  #### Sample mutation [#create-public-link]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(
      options: {ttl: time in seconds}
      guid: "YOUR_DASHBOARD_GUID"
    ) {
      url
    }
  }
  ```
  The live dashboard URL appears in the response. This is a public URL, so you can share it with anyone.

  #### Sample response [#create-public-link-response]

    ```graphql
    {
      "data": {
        "dashboardCreateLiveUrl": {
          "url": "https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/PUBLIC_LINK_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ```

  The `PUBLIC_LINK_ID` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to update or revoke the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph.

  <Callout variant="important">
    Any content update in the dashboard on New Relic platform reflects in the shared dashboard page.
  </Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url-with-psswd-nerdgraph" title="Create an URL with password protection">

To avoid unwanted access to the shared dashboard, you can create a live dashboard URL with password protection.

1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardCreateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `auth` > `factors` > `type`: Select `PASSWORD` to enable password protection for the live dashboard URL.
  * `GUID`: Enter the entity GUID of the dashboard.
  * `Options`(optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
          * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
          * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
          * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)
  * `auth` > `factors` > `password` > `value`: Select this to get the live dashboard password in the response.
  * `url`: Select this to get the live dashboard URL in the response.
  * Select any other fields you want in the response.

  #### Sample mutation [#create-public-link-with-password]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(
      guid: "YOUR_DASHBOARD_GUID"
      options: {ttl: 3600} # Optional: Set a time-to-live for the URL
      auth: {factors: [{type: PASSWORD}]}
    ) {
      url
      uuid
      auth {
        factors {
          type
          password {
            value # REQUEST THE PASSWORD VALUE HERE
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The live dashboard URL and password appear in the response.

  #### Sample response [#create-public-link-with-password-response]

  ```graphql
  {
    "data": {
      "dashboardCreateLiveUrl": {
        "auth": {
          "factors": [
            {
              "password": {
                "value": "pfd-3ZZ46#3a4On5p%&Â¿"
              },
              "type": "PASSWORD"
            }
          ]
        },
        "url": "https://staging-share.newrelic.com/dashboard/f6c730bf-fced-4890-ad6e-86ab6a6e8159",

      }
    }
  }

  ```  

  The `PUBLIC_LINK_ID` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to update or revoke the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph.

  <Callout variant="important">
    Copy and save the password. This password is available only once and can't be retrieved later. Follow our [password management best practices](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#password-management) to manage the password securely.  You need to share the password with the URL to allow external users to access the dashboard.

Make sure you have the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to modify the configuration of the shared dashboard. 

To update the time period for the URL to be live:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardUpdateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `id`: Copy the ID from the shared dashboard URL and enter it.
  * `Options` (optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
      * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
      * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
      * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)

#### Sample mutation [#update-public-link-request]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardUpdateLiveUrl(
      id:"enter the public URL ID"
      options: { ttl: "updated duration in seconds" }
    )
  }
  ```

  The URL appears in the response as follows. Now the URL will remain live for the updated time period.

  #### Sample response [#update-public-link-response]

    ```graphql
    {
      "data": {
        "dashboardUpdateLiveUrl": {
          "url": "https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/PUBLIC_LINK_ID"
