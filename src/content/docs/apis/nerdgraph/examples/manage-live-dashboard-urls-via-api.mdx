With the necessary [security and access set up](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) you can create, manage, and revoke publicly accessible live dashboard URLs using queries and mutations in [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), 
You can also do it from the [New Relic UI](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#dashboard).


<Callout variant="caution"> If a shared dashboard is not password-protected, anyone with the live URL can access and view all the information it contains. To prevent unwanted access, ensure you [create password-protected URLs](#create-dashboard-url-with-psswd-nerdgraph) or [enable password protection for existing shared URLs](#enable-password-dashboard-url-nerdgraph).</Callout>


For creating, updating, or revoking a publicly accessible live dashboard URL from NerdGraph, you need the GUID of the dashboard you want to share.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com//dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**<Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> > Metadata**</DNT>, and copy the entity GUID of the dashboard.

<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url-nerdgraph" title="Create an URL without password protection">
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardCreateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `GUID`: Enter the entity GUID of the dashboard.
  * `Options`(optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
          * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
          * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
          * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)
  * `url`: Select this to get the live dashboard URL in the response.
  * Select any other fields you want in the response.

  #### Sample mutation [#create-public-link]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(
      options: { ttl: TIME_IN_SECONDS }
      guid: "YOUR_DASHBOARD_GUID"
    ) {
      url
    }
  }
  ```
  The live dashboard URL appears in the response. This is a public URL, so you can share it with anyone.

  #### Sample response [#create-public-link-response]

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "dashboardCreateLiveUrl": {
          "url": "https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/PUBLIC_LINK_ID"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  The `PUBLIC_LINK_ID` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to update or revoke the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph.

  <Callout variant="important">
    Any content update in the dashboard on New Relic platform reflects on the shared dashboard page.
  </Callout>

<Collapser id="create-dashboard-url-with-psswd-nerdgraph" title="Create an URL with password protection">

To avoid unwanted access to the shared dashboard, you can create a live dashboard URL with password protection.

1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardCreateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `auth` > `factors` > `type`: Select `PASSWORD` to enable password protection for the live dashboard URL.
  * `GUID`: Enter the entity GUID of the dashboard.
  * `Options`(optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
          * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
          * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
          * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)
  * `auth` > `factors` > `password` > `value`: Select this to get the live dashboard password in the response.
  * `url`: Select this to get the live dashboard URL in the response.
  * Select any other fields you want in the response.

  #### Sample mutation [#create-public-link-with-password]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(
      guid: "YOUR_DASHBOARD_GUID"
      options: { ttl: 3600 } # Optional: Set a time-to-live for the URL
      auth: { factors: [{ type: PASSWORD }] }
    ) {
      url
      uuid
      auth {
        factors {
          type
          password {
            value # REQUEST THE PASSWORD VALUE HERE
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The live dashboard URL and password appear in the response.

  #### Sample response [#create-public-link-with-password-response]

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "dashboardCreateLiveUrl": {
        "auth": {
          "factors": [
            {
              "password": {
                "value": "pfd-3ZZ46#3a4On5p%&¿"
              },
              "type": "PASSWORD"
            }
          ]
        },
        "url": "https://one.newrelic.com/dashboard/f6c730bf-fced-4890-ad6e-86ab6a6e8159",
        "uuid": "f6c730bf-fced-4890-ad6e-86ab6a6e8159"
      }
    }
  }
  ```  

  The `uuid` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to [update](#update-dashboard-url-nerdgraph) or [revoke](revoke-dashboard-url-nerdgraph) the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph. To share the dashboard with external users, copy the URL and password from the response. Passwords can not be retrieved later. If you lose it, you only have to [reset the password](#reset-password-dashboard-url-nerdgraph) and share it again with the users. Follow our [password management best practices](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#password-management) to manage the password securely.

Make sure you have the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to modify the configuration of the shared dashboard. 

To update the time period for the URL to be live:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardUpdateLiveUrl` mutation with following parameters:
  * `id`: Copy the ID from the shared dashboard URL and enter it.
  * `options` (optional) > `ttl`: Enter the time period in seconds for the URL to be live.
      * **Minimum value**: `300` seconds (5 minutes)
      * **Maximum value**: `631152000` seconds (20 years)
      * **Default value**: `2592000` seconds (30 days)

#### Sample mutation [#update-public-link-request]

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardUpdateLiveUrl(
      id: "PUBLIC_URL_ID"
      options: { ttl: TIME_IN_SECONDS }
    )
  }
  ```

  The URL appears in the response as follows. Now the URL will remain live for the updated time period.

  #### Sample response [#update-public-link-response]

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "dashboardUpdateLiveUrl": {
          "url": "https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/PUBLIC_LINK_ID"

Make sure you have the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to modify the configuration of the shared dashboard. 
To enable password protection for a live dashboard URL: 
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the `dashboardUpdateLiveUrlAuth` mutation with following parameters:
  * `auth` > `factors` > `type`: Select `PASSWORD` to enable password protection for the live dashboard URL.
  * `id`: Copy the ID from the shared dashboard URL and enter it.
  * `auth` > `factors` > `password` > `value`: Select this to get the live dashboard password in the response.
  * Select any other fields you want in the response.

#### Sample mutation [#enable-password-protection]
  ```graphql
  mutation {
    dashboardUpdateLiveUrlAuth(
      id: "YOUR_PUBLIC_LINK_UUID"
      auth: { factors: [{ type: PASSWORD }] }
    ) {
      factors {
        password {
          value # A NEW PASSWORD WILL BE GENERATED AND RETURNED
        }
        type
      }

  }
  ```

  #### Sample response [#enable-password-protection-response]
  The password appears in the response as follows.

  ```json

      "dashboardUpdateLiveUrlAuth": {
        "factors": [
          {
            "password": {

            "type": "PASSWORD"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }

    After enabling password for the shared dashboards, you need to share the password with the users. Copy and save the password, as you cann't retrieve it later. If you lose it, you only have to [reset the password](#reset-password-dashboard-url-nerdgraph) and share it again with the users.
