With the necessary [security and access set up](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts) you can create, manage, and revoke publicly accessible live dashboard URLs using queries and mutations in [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), 
You can also do it from the [New Relic UI](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashbords-externally).

<Callout variant="caution">
  Anyone with the live dashboard or chart URLs can view all the information from the dashboard. Share information carefully and in accordance with your company's internal policies and procedures.
</Callout>

For creating, updating, or revoking a publicly accessible live dashboard URL from NerdGraph, you need the GUID of the dashboard you want to share.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com//dashboards)**</DNT>.
2. Open the dashboard you want to share.
3. Navigate to <DNT>**<Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> > Metadata**</DNT>, and copy the entity guid of the dasboard.

## Create a live dashboard URLs [#create-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]

To create a live dashboard URL:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * **Mutation**: `dashboardCreateLiveUrl`
  * **Parameter**: The entity guide of the dashboard
  * **Response**: `url`

  ```
  mutation CreatePublicLink {
    dashboardCreateLiveUrl(guid: "enter the dashboard GUID") {
      url
    }
  }

  ```
The live dashboard URL appears in the response as following. You can share this URL with anyone to render the dashboard publicaly.

  ```
  https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/<public_link_id>

  ```
The `<public_link_id>` is the ID of the shared dashboard. You can use it to update or revoke the shared dashboard URL through NerdGraph.

<Callout variant="important">
  Any content update in the dashboard on New Relic platform reflects in the shared dashboard page.
</Callout>

## Update the expiration date [#update-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]

Make sure you have the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) to modify the shared dashboard URL. To update the time period for the URL to be live:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * **Mutation**: `dashboardUpdateLiveUrl`
  * **Parameter**: The ID of the shared dashboard (Copy it from the shared dashboard URL.)
  * **Options**: The updated time period in seconds
      * **Minimum value**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
      * **Maximum value**: 631152000 seconds (20 years)
      * **Default value**: 2592000 seconds (30 days)

  ```
  mutation UpdatePublicLink{
        dashboardUpdateLiveUrl(
          id:"enter the public link ID"
          options: { ttl: "updated duration in seconds" }
        ) {
          title
          url
        }
  }

  ```
The URL appears in the response as following. Now the URL will remain live for the updated time period.

  ```
  https://share.newrelic.com/dashboard/<public_link_id>

  ```

## Revoke a live dashboard URL [#revoke-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]
Based on the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) you have, you can revoke only the URLs you have created, or all URLs created by users in the account. To revoke a shared dashboard URL:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * **Mutation**: `dashboardRevokeLiveUrl`
  * **Parameter**: The ID of the shared dashboard (Copy it from the shared dashboard URL.)

  ```
  mutation {
    dashboardRevokeLiveUrl(id: "<public_link_id>") {
      id
    }
  }

  ```
The shared dashboard URL is now revoked, and it will no longer be accessible. The response appears as following:

  ```
  {
    "data": {
      "dashboardRevokeLiveUrl": {
        "id": "<public_link_id>" //the one you passed to the mutation
      }
    }
  }

  ```
## List all shared dashboard URLs [#list-dashboard-url-nerdgraph]
Based on the [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/Prerequisites-to-share-dashboards-charts/#permissions-to-custom-role) you have, you can retrieve the list of links you have created, or all links created by users in the account. To get the list of shared dashboard URLs:
1. Go to [NerdGraph API explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql).
2. Construct a [graph API call](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) using the following details:
  * **Query**: `dashboard`
  * **Response**: `liveUrls`

  ```
  {
      actor {
        user {
          name
        }
          dashboard {
          liveUrls(filter: {type: DASHBOARD}) {
            liveUrls {
              createdAt
              type
              uuid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

  ```

  The list of the shared dashboard URLs appears in response.
