You can use [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to create and manage [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

## Overview [#starting-out]

For an introduction to our custom dashboards feature, see [the dashboards docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards). 

When using NerdGraph to configure dashboards, it helps to understand that our <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> are considered [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic), which have their own entity IDs, similar to other things we consider entities, like monitored apps, hosts, and services.

For how to add and configure widgets and charts in a dashboard, see [Configure charts and other widgets](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/create-widgets-dashboards-api).

## Operations [#operations]

We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope.

### Dashboard CRUD operations [#crud-operations]

Here are operations related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD).  

| Operation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              | GraphQL operation type | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actor > entity()`    | query                  | Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID.                                                                                                |
| `dashboardCreate()`   | mutation               | Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration.                                         |
| `dashboardUpdate()`   | mutation               | Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. |
| `dashboardDelete()`   | mutation               | Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard.                       |
| `dashboardUndelete()` | mutation               | Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Custom tags cannot be recovered.                                                                                         |

### Dashboard page operations [#page-operations]

| Operation                          | GraphQL operation type | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dashboardUpdatePage()`          | mutation               | Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. |
| `dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage()` | mutation               | Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration.               |
| `dashboardAddWidgetsToPage()`    | mutation               | Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration.                                    |

### Other operations [#other-operations]

| Operation                          | GraphQL operation type | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl()`   | mutation               | Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. |
| `actor > dashboard > liveUrls()` | query                  | List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data.  |
| `dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl()` | mutation               | Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public.                                                        |

## Cross-account dashboards [#cross-account]

With NerdGraph, you can [create queries of data from more than one New Relic account](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial#cross-account-query). You can also create a dashboard using data from across multiple accounts by adding account IDs to the `accountIds` array.

Here's an example of creating a cross-account dashboard: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cross-account-dashboard"
    title="Dashboard with cross-account query"
  >
```graphql
mutation {
  dashboardCreate(
    accountId: 1
    dashboard: {
      name: "Cross account queries - NerdGraph API - Cross Account Test1"
      description: null
      permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE
      pages: [
        {
          name: "Page 1"
          description: null
          widgets: [
            {
              visualization: { id: "viz.billboard" }
              layout: { column: 1, row: 1, height: 3, width: 4 }
              title: "Cross Account Total Transaction Count"
              rawConfiguration: {
                legend: { enabled: true }
                nrqlQueries: [
                  {
                    <var>accountIds: [1, 1606862, 2212585]</var>
                    query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction"
                  }
                ]
                yAxisLeft: { zero: true }
              }
              linkedEntityGuids: null
            }
            {
              visualization: { id: "viz.pie" }
              layout: { column: 5, row: 1, height: 3, width: 4 }
              title: "Cross Account Pie"
              rawConfiguration: {
                legend: { enabled: true }
                nrqlQueries: [
                  {
                    <var>accountIds: [1, 1606862, 2212585]</var>
                    query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET accountId()"
                  }
                ]
                yAxisLeft: { zero: true }
              }
              linkedEntityGuids: null
            }
            {
              visualization: { id: "viz.line" }
              layout: { column: 9, row: 1, height: 3, width: 4 }
              title: "Cross Account Line"
              rawConfiguration: {
                legend: { enabled: true }
                nrqlQueries: [
                  {
                    <var>accountIds: [1, 1606862, 2212585]</var>
                    query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET accountId() TIMESERIES"
                  }
                ]
                yAxisLeft: { zero: true }
              }
              linkedEntityGuids: null
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Limits [#limits]

We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability.

### Dashboard limits [#dashboard-limits]

| Limit                                     | Value |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Maximum number of pages in a dashboard    | 25    |
| Maximum length of a dashboard name        | 255   |
| Maximum length of a dashboard description | 1024  |

### Dashboard page limits [#page-limits]

| Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page  | 150   |
| Maximum length of a dashboard page name        | 255   |
| Maximum length of a dashboard page description | 1024  |

### Widget limits [#widget-limits]

| Limit                                         | Value |

| Minimum layout height of a widget             | 1     |

## Errors as first class citizens [#errors-first-class]

All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="errors-first-class"
    title="Errors as part of every mutation response"
  >
    ```
    mutation {
        dashboardMutation(guid: "<var>MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID</var>") {
          mutationResult {
            result
          }
          errors {
            description
            type
          }
        }
      }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard [GraphQL errors field](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#response).
