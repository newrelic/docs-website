With our streaming export feature, available with [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus), you can send your data to an AWS Kinesis Firehose as it's ingested by New Relic. We'll explain how to create and update a streaming rule using [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) and how to view existing rules. You can use [the NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer) to make these calls.

## What is streaming export? [#definition]

As data is ingested by your New Relic organization, our streaming export feature sends that data to an AWS Kinesis Firehose. You can set up custom rules, defined using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), that govern what kinds of New Relic data you'll export.

Some examples of things you can use streaming export for:

* To populate a data lake
* Enhance AI/ML training
* Long-term retention for compliance, legal, or security reasons

You can disable or enable streaming export rules whenever you want. But note that streaming export only sends currently ingested data, which means that if you disable it and re-enable it, the data ingested when it was off won't be sent with this feature. For exporting past data, you can use [Historical data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export).

## Requirements and limits [#requirements]

Permissions-related requirements:
* Pro or Enterprise edition with [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus) option
* [Core or full platform users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) with the [streaming data capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities#data-platform).

You must have an Amazon Kinesis Firehose set up to receive New Relic data. If you haven't already done this, you can follow our steps [below](#firehose-setup).

NRQL requirements:
* Must be flat queries, with no aggregation. For example, `SELECT *` or `SELECT column1, column2` forms are supported.
* Applicable for anything in the `WHERE` clause, except subqueries.
* Query cannot have a `FACET` clause, `COMPARE WITH`, or `LOOKUP`.
* Nested queries are not supported.
* Supports [data types stored in NRDB](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data), and not [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data).

## Set up Amazon Kinesis Firehose [#firehose-setup]

To set up streaming data export, you must first set up an Amazon Kinesis Firehose. We'll walk you through that procedure in the next three steps.

### Step 1. Create a Firehose for streaming export [#create-firehose]

Create a dedicated Firehose to stream your New Relic data to:

1. Go to Amazon Kineses Data Firehose.
2. Create a delivery stream.
3. Name the stream (you will use this name later in the rule registration).
4. Use **Direct PUT or other sources** and specify a destination compatible with New Relic's JSON event format (for example, S3, Redshift, or OpenSearch).

### Step 2. Create IAM Firehose write access policy [#create-policy]

1. Go to the IAM and select **Policies**.
2. Create a policy.
3. Select the Firehose service, and then select `PutRecord` and `PutRecordBatch`.
4. For `Resources`, select the delivery stream, add ARN, and select the region of your stream.
5. Enter your AWS account number, and then enter your desired delivery stream name in the name box.
6. Create the policy.

### Step 3. Create IAM role for granting New Relic write access [#iam-role]

To set up the IAM role:

1. Navigate to the IAM and click on **Roles**.
3. Create a role for an AWS account, and then select **for another AWS account**.
4. Enter the New Relic export account ID: `888632727556`.
5. Select **Require external ID** and enter the [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id) of the New Relic account you want to export from.
6. Click **Permissions**, and then select the policy you created above.
7. Add a role name (this will be used in the export registration) and description.
8. Create the role.

When that's done, you can work on setting up your export rules using NerdGraph. For more on that, keep reading.

## Important fields [#fields]

Most of the streaming data export NerdGraph calls we'll be covering use a few fields that are related to your AWS account:

* `awsAccountId`: The [AWS account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html). For example: `10000000000`
* `deliveryStreamName`: The [Kinesis stream name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStream.html). For example: `firehose-test-stream`.
* `region`: The [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html). For example: `us-east-1`.
* `role`: The [AWS IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) for Kinesis Firehose. This will always be `firehose-role`.

## How to create a stream [#create-stream]

First, decide which data you want to export. Then, with a NerdGraph call, you'll create the streaming rules you want using NRQL. We'll give some examples.

### Create a stream [#create-stream]

When you create a new streaming rule, you'll need all of the following fields. Here's an example of creating a streaming rule:

```graphql
mutation {
  streamingExportCreateRule(
    accountId: INSERT_YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID,
    ruleParameters: {
      description: "ADD_RULE_DESCRIPTION",
      name: "PROVIDE_RULE_NAME",
      nrql: "SELECT * FROM NodeStatus"
    },
    awsParameters: {
      awsAccountId: "YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID",
      deliveryStreamName: "INSERT_FIREHOSE_STREAM_NAME",
      region: "SPECIFY_AWS_REGION",
      role: "firehose-role"
    }
  ) {
    id
    status
  }
}
```

You'll get a result immediately with a rule ID and status. The status will be shown as `CREATION_IN_PROGRESS`. You can use the rule id to check if the rule is created successfully.

It can take up to six minutes for the rule to complete creation due to the AWS policy validation taking some time.

Before the rule finishes registering, you can't initiate another mutation action (like `Enable`, `Disable`, or `Update`) because the rule is locked for the creation process. If you try another mutation action before the rule completes the registration process, you'll get a message like, "The export rule is currently being updated by another request, please wait and try again later."

You can use `Delete` at any time.

The creation can finish and change the status at any time within the roughly six minutes required for rule creation. The status will change to `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`, or `CREATION_FAILED`.

See these details on the values:

* `ENABLED` means the rule is created successfully and data has started to be streamed.
* `CREATION_FAILED` means the rule failed on creation. This can happen for several reasons, including AWS policy validation.
* `DISABLED` means the rule is created but is not enabled yet due to reasons such as filter stream limit being reached, or failing on filter stream rule creation. If the status still remains as `CREATION_IN_PROGRESS` after six minutes, that means the rule creation failed due to a system error on our service. You can delete the rule and try to create a new one again.

Once a streaming rule is created, you can [view it](#view-stream).

### Update a stream [#update-stream]

When you update a new streaming rule, you'll need all of the following fields. Here's an example of updating a streaming rule:

```graphql
mutation {
  streamingExportUpdateRule(
    id: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID,
    ruleParameters: {
      description: "ADD_RULE_DESCRIPTION",
      name: "PROVIDE_RULE_NAME",
      nrql: "INSERT_YOUR_NRQL_QUERY"
    },
    awsParameters: {
      awsAccountId: "YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID",
      deliveryStreamName: "INSERT_FIREHOSE_STREAM_NAME",
      region: "SPECIFY_AWS_REGION",
      role: "firehose-role"
    }
  ) {
    id
    status
  }
}
```

When updating, you'll get a message in the message field: “The export rule is being updated and the process may take a few minutes to complete. Please check again later.” It can take up to six minutes to be fully updated.

You can check if the rule is updated by calling `streamingRule` to retrieve the rule. During the period that the rule is under updating, the rule is locked, and no other mutation action can act on the rule. If you are trying to perform another mutation action on the same rule, you will get a message saying, “The export rule is currently being updated by another request, please wait and try again later.” A user can update a rule of any status except a deleted rule.

### Disable a stream [#disable-stream]

To disable a rule, you only need to provide the rule ID. Here's an example of disabling a stream:

```graphql
mutation {
  streamingExportDisableRule(id: INSERT_RULE_ID) {
    id
    status
    message
  }
}
```

You can only disable the rule when the rule has a status of `ENABLED`. If you're trying to disable a rule that's in another state, it returns the error message, "The export rule can't be enabled or disabled due to status not being allowed." You can't disable the rule if the rule is locked due to another mutation being done.

### Enable a stream [#enable-stream]

If you want to enable a rule, you only need to provide the rule ID. Here's an example of enabling a stream:

```graphql
mutation {
  streamingExportEnableRule(id: INSERT_RULE_ID) {
    id
    status
    message
  }
}
```

You can only enable the rule when it has a status of `DISABLED`. If you're trying to enable a rule that's in another state, it returns the error message like, "The export rule can't be enabled or disabled due to status not being allowed." You can't enable the rule if the rule is locked due to another mutation being done.

### Delete a stream [#delete-stream]

You'll need to provide a rule ID to delete a stream. Here's an example:

```graphql
mutation {
  streamingExportDeleteRule(id: INSERT_RULE_ID) {
    id
    ...
  }
}
```

Deleting can be performed on a rule of any status unless it’s already deleted. Once a rule is deleted, it can't be reactivated again. The rule can be still viewed within the first 24 hours after deletion by calling the `steamingRule` API with the rule ID. After 24 hours, the rule won’t be searchable anymore through NerdGraph.


## View streams [#view-stream]

You can query information about a specific stream rule by querying for the account ID and rule ID. Here's an example:

```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      streamingExport {
        streamingRule(id: "INSERT_RULE_ID") {
          aws {
            awsAccountId
            deliveryStreamName
            region
            role
          }
          createdAt
          description
          id
          message
          name
          nrql
          status
          updatedAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also query for all existing streams. Here's an example:

```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      streamingExport {
        streamingRules {
          aws {
            awsAccountId
            region
            deliveryStreamName
            role
          }
          createdAt
          description
          id
          message
          name
          nrql
          status
          updatedAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
