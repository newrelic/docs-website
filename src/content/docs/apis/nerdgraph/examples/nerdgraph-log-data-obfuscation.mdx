---

You control what customer data is logged with our log management service, so be sure to follow your organization's security guidelines to mask, obfuscate, or prevent sending any sensitive data.

Our log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see our [security documentation](/docs/logs/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy) for log management.

You can use NerdGraph at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to create, query, and manage your data obfuscation rules for logs. NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API explorer.

## Parts of an obfuscation rule [#components]

The obfuscation rule is an enriched entity that allows you to apply different regexes to logs. It has three main components:

* **Filter:** NRQL query to filter the logs you want to obfuscate

* **Expressions:** The regex you want to apply; for example:

  ```
  name: email
  regex: [^@ \t\r\n]+@[^@ \t\r\n]+\.[^@ \t\r\n]+
  ```

* **Actions:** Which attribute to apply an expression and which obfuscation method to use

## Obfuscation API fields [#obfuscation-fields]

Available fields for your obfuscation rules include:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: "200px"}}>

## Create obfuscation rule [#create-rule]

Before you can create an obfuscation rule, first create an obfuscation expression:

```
mutation{createObfuscationExpression( 
   			accountId:12345678, 
            expression: { 
            name: "SimpleNumericExpression", 
            description: "", 
            regex: "([0-9])" 
             })
            {id name description regex}}
```

You'll get a response like this example:

```
{
	"data": {
		"createObfuscationExpression": {
			"id": "161",
			"name": "SimpleNumericExpression",
			"description": null,
			"regex": "([0-9])"
		}
	}
}
```

Then, to create an obfuscation rule, follow this example format. Replace the following [fields](#obfuscation-fields) with your values.

* `accountId`
* `name`
* `description`
* `filter`
* `method`
* `expressionId`

```
mutation { createObfuscationRule(accountId: 12345678, rule: {
                   name: "Auth Service Obfuscation Rule",
                   description: "Hashes numbers from auth service logs",
                   filter: "serviceName='AuthService'"
                   enabled: true,
                   actions: [
                       {
                           attributes: ["message"]
                           method: HASH_SHA256,
                           expressionId: 166,
                       }
                   ]
               }) {
                   id,
                   name,
                   description,
                   filter,
                   createdBy,
                   updatedBy,
                   enabled,
                   actions {
                       id,
                       attributes,
                       method,
                       expression {
                           id,
                           name,
                           description,
                           regex,
                           createdBy,
                           updatedBy,
                       }
                   }
               }
            }
```

  You can include any of the following [fields](#obfuscation-fields) in your query:

  * `createdAt`
  * `createdBy`
  * `description`
  * `id`
  * `name`
  * `regex`
  * `updatedAt`
  * `updatedBy`

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update-expression"
    title="Update obfuscation expression"
  >
  This example updates an obfuscation expression for your log data.

  ```
  mutation{updateObfuscationExpression( 
            accountId:12345678, 
            expression: { 
            id:160,
            name: "ModifiedName",  
             }) 
            {id name description regex}}
  ```
  
  Include the following [fields](#obfuscation-fields) as needed in your update. The `id` is required. The others are optional, but at least one must be present:

  * `id` (required)

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

            id:160) 
            {id name description createdBy updatedBy }}
  ```

  **Reviewer:** Are there any guidelines or cautions about what happens when you delete the rule? For example, if they were previously masking something their company requires, how long would it take before logs would start showing that data? Does the deletion take effect immediately?

## Anything else?

**Reviewer:** Anything else to say about this API? For example, the security doc says if they need to opt out of automatic obfuscation, they should contact New Relic Support. Will that still be true with this API?
