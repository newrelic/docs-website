<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


You can use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) mutations to manage [metric normalization rules](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/metric-normalization-rules) in New Relic. By leveraging these mutations, you can create, edit, enable, and disable these rules directly from your New Relic account. This provides a streamlined and programmatic approach to resolve [Metric Grouping Issues (MGIs).](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues)

The metric normalization rules are used to:

    * Group or filter out [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data).
    * Manage high cardinality metrics by renaming, dropping, or transforming them before they're ingested into New Relic. 
    * Prevent [MGIs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues) to ensure that your metrics are well-organized and meaningful.
    * Reduce the number of unique metric names reported to New Relic.


## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* A [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and with that account, you can access your API user key that you need to include with [queries and mutations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

* User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data#user-permissions).


<Callout variant="tip">
    You can also create metric normalization rule by using the New Relic platform. For more information, refer to [Metric normalization rules](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/metric-normalization-rules).
</Callout>


## Retrieve the metric normalization rules [#nerdgraph-query]


Use the `metricNormalizationRules` query to retrieve all metric normalization rules associated with your account. This query provides a comprehensive overview of the existing rules, including their status and configuration.

### Input parameters

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute name</th>
            <th>Data type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`accountId`</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>(Required) The account ID associated with the rule.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`enable`</td>
            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>(Required) If set to `true`, only enabled rules are returned.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

            name
            }
            account(id: xxxxxx) {
            metricNormalization {
                metricNormalizationRules(enabled: true) {
                action
                applicationGuid

                }
            }
            }
        }
    }

```


## Mutations [#nerdgraph-mutations]

Manage your metric normalization rules with the following [NerdGraph mutations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology):

    Use the `metricNormalizationEditRule` mutation to update the value of the existing rule using the `ruleId` parameters. It provides flexibility to adjust the rule as per the new insights or changing requirements. You can fetch `ruleId` information using [`Retrieve the metric normalization rules`](#nerdgraph-query) query.
