You can manage alerts conditions using our NerdGraph API.

<Callout variant="tip">
  See the [NerdGraph introduction](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) for help getting started with NerdGraph and the NerdGraph explorer.

## Steps to create a NRQL condition [#steps]

Follow these steps:

1. Decide which condition type you want to create (see [NRQL Condition threshold types](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries#threshold-types)).
2. Find your relevant `policyID` by doing one of the following:

   * Use the [NerdGraph policies API](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-policies).
   * Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert conditions (Policies)**</DNT>. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name.
3. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like "What does the `valueFunction` field accept?" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation.
</Callout>

## NRQL static condition [#static-condition]

Here's an example of creating a static condition:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: {
    name: "Low Host Count - Catastrophic"
    enabled: true
    nrql: {
      query: "SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='my-app-name'"
    }
    signal: {
      aggregationWindow: 60
      aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW
      aggregationDelay: 120
    }
    terms: {
      threshold: 2
      thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE
      thresholdDuration: 600
      operator: BELOW
      priority: CRITICAL
    }
    valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE
    violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## NRQL baseline condition [#baseline-condition]

Here's an example of creating a baseline condition:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: {
    name: "Baseline Condition"
    enabled: true
    baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY
    nrql: {
      query: "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction"
    }
    signal: {
      aggregationWindow: 60
      aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW
      aggregationDelay: 120
    }
    terms: {
      threshold: 13
      thresholdDuration: 180
      thresholdOccurrences: ALL
      operator: ABOVE
      priority: CRITICAL
    }
    violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400
  }) {
    id
    name
    baselineDirection
  }
}
```

## Update a condition [#update-condition]

Complete the following:

1. Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a `nrqlConditionsSearch` query like this:

   ```graphql
   {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         alerts {
           nrqlConditionsSearch {
             nrqlConditions {
               id
               type
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   <Callout variant="tip">
     The `type` returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is `STATIC`, use `alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate`. If the type returned is `BASELINE`, use `alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate`.
   </Callout>
2. Provide the `id` of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type.

Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched.

## Update mutations

Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, `baselineDirection` returns unchanged, but `name` is updated.

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: {
    name: "Your updated name"
  }) {
    id
    name
    baselineDirection
  }
}
```

## List and filter NRQL conditions [#filtering]

To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the `nrqlConditionsSearch` query in NerdGraph.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="pagination"
    title="Use cursor pagination"
  >
    The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account.

    The `nrqlConditionsSearch` query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty.

    An initial list response will look something like this:

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          alerts {
            nrqlConditionsSearch {
              nextCursor
              nrqlConditions {
                id
                name
                type
              }
              totalCount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This example returns a JSON response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "actor": {
          "account": {
            "alerts": {
              "nrqlConditionsSearch": {
              "nextCursor": "WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==",
              "nrqlConditions": [
                {
                  "id": "4432",
                  "name": "Baseline Condition",
                  "type": "BASELINE"
                },
                {
                  "id": "443",
                  "name": "A static condition",
                  "type": "STATIC"
                },
                // more conditions here in reality
              ],
              "totalCount": 435
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the `nextCursor` returns from the response as `null`:

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          alerts {
            nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: "WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==",
            ) {
              nextCursor
              nrqlConditions {
                id
                name
                type
              }
              totalCount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="specific-fields"
    title="Request type-specific fields"
  >
    Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept.

    For example, `valueFunction` is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and `baselineDirection` is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions.

    But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition:

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          alerts {
            nrqlConditionsSearch {
              nrqlConditions {
                id
                name
                type
                ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition {
                  valueFunction
                }
                ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition {
                  baselineDirection
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type.

    So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the `valueFunction` in the object, and when the returned type is an baseline condition, it will return `baselineDirection` instead. Here is an example response:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "actor": {
          "account": {
            "alerts": {
              "nrqlConditionsSearch": {
                "nrqlConditions": [
                  {
                    "baselineDirection": "UPPER_ONLY",
                    "id": "342",
                    "name": "My baseline condition",
                    "type": "BASELINE"
                  },
                  {
                    "id": "553",
                    "name": "My static condition",
                    "type": "STATIC",
                    "valueFunction": "SINGLE_VALUE"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nrql-conditions"
    title="Filter NRQL conditions"
  >
    You can filter NRQL conditions with the `searchCriteria` argument of the `nrqlConditionsSearch` query:

    Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive.

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          alerts {
            nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: {
              name: "Baseline Condition"
            }) {
              nrqlConditions {
                id
                name
                type
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Singular NRQL condition queries [#singular-condition]

You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the `nrqlCondition` query in the alerts namespace.

Similar to type specific fields on the `nrqlConditionSearch` query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      alerts {
        nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) {
          id
          name
          ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition {
            valueFunction
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Update the description [#description]

This will walk you through the procedure to create a [description](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/alert-condition-descriptions) for a NRQL alert condition.

1. Get all the conditions for a policy:

   ```graphql
   {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         alerts {
           nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: {policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID}) {
             nrqlConditions {
               id
               name
               description
               enabled
               nrql {
                 query
               }
               signal {
                 aggregationWindow
                 aggregationMethod
                 aggregationDelay
                 aggregationTimer
               }
               policyId
               runbookUrl
               terms {
                 operator
                 thresholdDuration
                 threshold
                 priority
                 thresholdOccurrences
               }
               type
               violationTimeLimitSeconds
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Get the details for a single condition:

   ```graphql
   {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         alerts {
           nrqlCondition(id: "YOUR_CONDITION_ID") {
             description
             id
             enabled
             name
             nrql {
               query
             }
             signal {
               aggregationWindow
               aggregationMethod
               aggregationDelay
               aggregationTimer
             }
             policyId
             runbookUrl
             terms {
               operator
               priority
               threshold
               thresholdDuration
               thresholdOccurrences
             }
             type
             violationTimeLimitSeconds
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create a mutation with the description.

   Here's an empty mutation template:

   ```graphql
   mutation {
     alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
       accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, 
       id: "YOUR_CONDITION_ID", 
       condition: { description: "" }
     ) {
       description
     }
   }  
   ```

   Here's an example mutation with an included example description:

   ```graphql
   mutation {
     alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
       accountId: 123456
       id: "123456"
       condition: {
         description: "timestamp : {{timestamp}} \n accountId : {{accountId}} \n type : {{type}} \n event : {{event}} \n description : {{description}} \n policyId : {{policyId}} \n policyName: {{policyName}} \n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \n product : {{product}} \n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \n targetID : {{targetId}} \n targetName : {{targetName}} \n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}"
       }
     ) {
       description
     }
   }

   ```

## Delete conditions

You can use the `alertsConditionDelete` mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the `id` field on a delete mutation; for example:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) {
    id
  }
}
```
