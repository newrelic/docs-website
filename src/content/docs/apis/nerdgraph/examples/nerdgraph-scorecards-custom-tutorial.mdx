<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


A Scorecard serves as a container for various rules that collectively assess adherence to defined standards. Scorecards use rules to monitor compliance across different entities and teams, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with both internal and external requirements. This document provides instruction on how to create and manage Scorecards and its rules in New Relic.

In New Relic, two types of users can manage Scorecards:

* Organization Product Admin
* Scorecard custom role users


This section provides instructions on using NerdGraph GraphQL mutations to create a custom role for managing Scorecards and associated rules.

To create a Scorecards administrator custom role, you need to:

1. [Find the required permission IDs for Scorecards](#retrieve-organization-scoped-capabilities)
2. [Retrieve your organization ID](#retrieve-your-organization-id)
3. [Create the custom role for Scorecards administrator](#create-custom-role)
4. [Add the custom role to a user group](#add-custom-role-to-a-user-group)


**Prerequisites:**

* [General NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication)
* You must be an Organization Product Admin to create a custom role.


## Mutations [#mutations]

New Relic provides various NerdGraph mutations to create custom role for Scorecards managers.

      title="Find the required permission IDs for Scorecards">
    Use the `customerAdministration` query to retrieve a list of capabilities, their permission IDs, and related information.

After you have created the custom role, you must associate this role with a user group on the New Relic platform.  

### Fetch the group ID

You can use `customerAdministration` query to retrieve the list of group IDs.


#### Input parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Is it Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>

      <td>String</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>The organization ID copied in the previous step.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Sample request

```graphql
{
  customerAdministration {
    groups(filter: { organizationId: { eq: "xxx****xxx-xx**00**-xxx-x*x*-xx**XXX**XX" } }) {
      nextCursor
      items {
        id
        name
        users {
          items {
            id
            email
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

From the displayed list of group IDs, copy the desired group ID to associate the custom Scorecard role you created earlier. 
  
### Add the rule to a user group

You can use `authorizationManagementGrantAccess` mutation to add the role to a user group.


#### Input parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Is it Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`groupId`</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>The group ID retrieved in the previous step.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Sample request

```graphql
mutation {
  authorizationManagementGrantAccess(
    grantAccessOptions: {
      organizationAccessGrants: { roleId: "99999999" }
      groupId: "xxx****xxx-xx**00**-xxx-x*x*-xx**XXX**XX"
    }
  ) {
    roles {
      id
      name
      organizationId
      roleId
      groupId
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "authorizationManagementGrantAccess": {
      "roles": [
        {
          "displayName": "Scorecards manager",
          "groupId": null,
          "id": "99999999",
          "name": "scorecards_manager",
          "organizationId": "xxx****xxx-xx**00**-xxx-x*x*-xx**XXX**XX",
          "roleId": 99999
        }
      ]
    }
  }

## Check the new role in New Relic platform [#check-role]

You can validate if the scorecard role is reflecting in the New Relic platform. 

**To check the role:**
