<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


A Scorecard serves as a container for various rules that collectively assess adherence to defined standards. Scorecards use rules to monitor compliance across different entities and teams, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with both internal and external requirements. This document provides instruction on how to create and manage Scorecards and its rules in New Relic.

In New Relic, two types of users can manage Scorecards:

* Organization Admin
* Scorecard custom role users


This section provides instructions on using NerdGraph GraphQL mutations to create a custom role for managing Scorecards and associated rules.

To create a Scorecards administrator custom role, you need to:

* [Retrieve all the organization-scoped capabilities](#retrieve-organization-scoped-capabilities)
* [Retrieve your organization ID](#retrieve-your-organization-id)
* Find the required permission IDs for Scorecards
* [Create the custom role for Scorecards administrator](#create-custom-role)
* [Add the custom role to a user group](#add-custom-role-to-a-user-group)


**Prerequisites:**

* [General NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication)
* You must be an Organization Admin to create a custom role.


## Mutations [#mutations]

New Relic provides various NerdGraph mutations to create custom role for Scorecards managers.

After you have created the custom role, you must associate this role with a user group on the New Relic platform.  

### Fetch the group ID

You can use `customerAdministration` mutation to retrieve the list of group ID's.


#### Input parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Is it Required?</th>

{
  customerAdministration {
    groups(filter: {organizationId: {eq: "xxx****xxx-xx**00**-xxx-x*x*-xx**XXX**XX"}}) {
      nextCursor
      items {
        id
        name
        users {
          items {
            id
            email
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

From the displayed list of group IDs, copy the desired group ID to associate the custom Scorecard role you created earlier. 
  
### Add the rule to a user group

You can use `authorizationManagementGrantAccess` mutation to add the role to a user group.


#### Input parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Is it Required?</th>

    roles {
      id
      name
      organizationId
      roleId
      groupId
      displayName
    }
  }

#### Sample response

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "authorizationManagementGrantAccess": {
      "roles": [
        {
          "displayName": "Scorecards manager",
          "groupId": null,
          "id": "99999999",
          "name": "scorecards_manager",
          "organizationId": "xxx****xxx-xx**00**-xxx-x*x*-xx**XXX**XX",
