For New Relic applied intelligence, you can create and manage [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows) using our NerdGraph API.

## List and filter workflows [#filtering]

The `workflows` query allows you to paginate through all of your workflows per account. It also allows some filtering functionality on the account workflows. Here are some example use cases: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="account"
    title="Listing all workflows for an account"
  >
    
```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiWorkflows {
        workflows(filters: {}) {
          entities {
            id
            name
            workflowEnabled
            destinationConfigurations {
              channelId
              name
              type
              notificationTriggers
            }
            enrichments {
              configurations {
                ... on AiWorkflowsNrqlConfiguration {
                  query
                }
              }
              id
              name
            }
          }
          nextCursor
          totalCount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="pagination"
    title="Paginating through policies with cursor pagination:"
  >

In order to paginate through your workflows, you must request the `nextCursor` field on your initial query.

With cursor pagination, you continue to make a request through the result set until the `nextCursor` that's returned from the response comes back empty. This indicates you've reached the end of your results.

First call: 

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiWorkflows {
        workflows(filters: {}) {
          entities {
            id
            name
          }
          nextCursor
          totalCount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response: 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "actor": {
      "account": {
        "aiWorkflows": {
          "workflows": {

              },
              {
                "id": <WORKFLOW ID>, 
                "name": <WORKFLOW NAME>
              },
              // ... more workflows would be here 
            ]
          }

<Collapser
    id="destination-type"
    title="Find workflows by destination type"
  >
Finds all the workflows that have at least a single destination configuration of a certain type.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiWorkflows {
        workflows(filters: {destinationType: DESTINATION_TYPE}) {
          entities {
            id
            name
            destinationConfigurations {
              type
            }
          }
          nextCursor
          totalCount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


## Create a workflow [#create-workflow]

In order to create a workflow you should first [create destinations and channels](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-channels).

<Callout variant="note">
A channel ID is unique and so can't be used in multiple workflows or used multiple times in the same workflow.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="issues"
    title="Create a workflow to catch all issues"
  >

The `issuesFilter` attribute decides which issue events will be caught by the workflow.

By keeping the `predicates` attribute's value as an empty list, the workflow will catch all the possible issue events. When you select an attribute value you can then filter issue events.

For example, we can choose an attribute that only filters issues that are relevant to a specific team: 

```graphql
mutation {
  aiWorkflowsCreateWorkflow(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, createWorkflowData: {destinationsEnabled: true, workflowEnabled: true, name: "API Demo Workflow", issuesFilter: {name: "team specific issues", predicates: [{ attribute: "accumulations.tag.team", operator: EXACTLY_MATCHES, values:["security"]}], type: FILTER}, destinationConfigurations: {channelId: "CHANNEL_ID", notificationTriggers: ["ACTIVATED", "ACKNOWLEDGED", "CLOSED"]}, enrichmentsEnabled: true, enrichments: {nrql: []}, , mutingRulesHandling: DONT_NOTIFY_FULLY_MUTED_ISSUES}) {
    workflow {
      id
      name
      destinationConfigurations {
        channelId
        name
        type
        notificationTriggers
      }
      enrichmentsEnabled
      destinationsEnabled
      issuesFilter {
        accountId
        id
        name
        predicates {
          attribute
          operator
          values
        }
        type
      }
      lastRun
      workflowEnabled
      mutingRulesHandling
    }
    errors {
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Update a workflow [#update-workflow]

When you update a workflow, note the only mandatory attributes you need to supply are the workflow ID and account ID. The rest are optional. For example, you only need to supply the name if you only intend to update the name.

To get the workflow ID, go to the workflow table and click **...** at the end of the row. Then, choose **Copy workflow id to clipboard**.

Here's an example of updating a workflow: 
```graphql
mutation {
  aiWorkflowsUpdateWorkflow(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, updateWorkflowData: {name: "UPDATED_API_DEMO_WORKFLOW", id: WORKFLOW_ID}) {
    workflow {
      id
      name
      destinationConfigurations {
        channelId
        name
        type
        notificationTriggers
      }
      enrichmentsEnabled
      destinationsEnabled
      issuesFilter {
        accountId
        id
        name
        predicates {
          attribute
          operator
          values
        }
        type
      }
      lastRun
      workflowEnabled
      mutingRulesHandling
    }
    errors {
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```


## Delete a workflow [#delete-workflow]

Here's an example of deleting a workflow: 

```graphql
mutation {
  aiWorkflowsDeleteWorkflow(id: WORKFLOW_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
    id
    errors {
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Test a workflow [#test-workflow]

The test searches for previous issues that match your inputs and creates a fake notification based on that. If no previous issue matching your inputs has been found it will return an error.

For example: 

```graphql
mutation {
  aiWorkflowsTestWorkflow(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, testWorkflowData: {destinationConfigurations: {channelId: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, type: SLACK}, issuesFilter: {predicates: [], type: YOUR_FILTER}}) {
    status
    notificationResponses {
      status
      evidence
      channelId
    }
    errors {
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```
