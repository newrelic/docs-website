To allow data sharing between accounts within an organization, an account must opt in to the 'cross-account alerting' feature. Follow these instructions on how to use the NerdGraph API Explorer to update account settings by enabling cross-account alerting.

  Only users with the "Data-sharing access control" permission can update cross-account elections for data sharing. By default, this permission is granted only to users with the "Organization Manager" role.

## Steps to update a cross-account alerting election

mutation {
  alertsUpdateCrossAccountElections(

    electionStatus: true
  ) {
    electionStatus
