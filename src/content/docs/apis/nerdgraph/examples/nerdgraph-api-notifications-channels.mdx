In addition to managing your [applied intelligence notification channels in the UI](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications), you can use our NerdGraph API.

<Callout variant="important">
This document refers to using Nerdgraph APIs for the new notification platform using destinations and notification messages. Notification messages are also referred to as channels, which are different from legacy notification channels.

## List and filter channels [#list-and-filter]

The `channels` query allows you to paginate through all of your channels per account. It also allows some filtering functionality.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="list-all-channels"
    title="Listing all channels for an account"
  >
    Here's an example:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels {
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
              error {
                details
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="paginate"
    title="Paginating through channels with cursor pagination"
  >
    In order to paginate through your channels, you must request the `nextCursor` field on your initial query.

    With cursor pagination, you continue to make a request through the result set until the `nextCursor` that is returned from the response comes back empty. This signifies that you reached the end of your results.

    Here's an example:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(cursor: "") {
              nextCursor
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
              totalCount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The code above returns a set of results like this:

    ```
    {
      "data": {
        "actor": {
          "account": {
            "aiNotifications": {
              "channels": {
                "nextCursor": "/8o0y2qiR54m6thkdgHgwg==:jZTXDFKbTkhKwvMx+CtsPVM=",
                "entities": [
                  {
                    "id": "01c0cbe7-3d70-47c1-99e0-adf906eed6c2",
                    "name": "Channel Name"
                  },
                  {
                    "id": "05db0207-c137-4985-8cb5-f21e7e57b8cc",
                    "name": "Another Channel Name"
                  },
                  // ... more channels here in reality
                ],
                "totalCount": 807
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    So, in your subsequent request, provide the cursor like so, until the cursor is empty:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(cursor: "") {
              nextCursor
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
              totalCount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="find-channels-by-name"
    title="Find all channels by name"
  >
    The API allows channel queries by name. The `name` filter returns exact matches and partial matches. It's case insensitive. This will only return the information for the channels that match the name supplied.

    In this example, we want to find channels with "DevOps" in the name:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(filters: {
              name: "DevOps"
            }) {
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="find-by-id"
    title="Find channel by id"
  >
    The API lets you query by channel ID:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(filters: {id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID}) {
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="find-by-destination-id"
    title="Find all channels by destination id"
  >
    The API lets you query channels by destination ID:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(filters: {destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID}) {
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="find-by-type"
    title="Find all channels by type"
  >
    The API lets you query by channel type. The following query will return all email channels on the chosen account:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          aiNotifications {
            channels(filters: {type: EMAIL}) {
              entities {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Create a channel [#create-channel]

In order to create a channel, different inputs must be supplied for each channel type. Each channel is connected to a destination. For information on destinations, see the [NerdGraph tutorial on destinations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-destinations).

The best practice is to use the `channelSchema` endpoint to see which fields must be sent under `properties` like so:

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiNotifications {
        channelSchema(
          channelType: CHANNEL_TYPE,
          destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
          product:  YOUR_PRODUCT,
          constraints: []
        ) {
          schema {
              fields {
                mandatory
                label
                key
                component
              }
            }
            result
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="jira"
    title="Atlassian Jira"
  >
Jira is a configurable ticketing system, and therefore there's no static way to create this channel.

There are two static fields - `project` and `issuetype`.

Fetch the `project` suggestions, and use one of the values as the constraint for `issuetype`, as shown here:

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiNotifications {
        channelSuggestions(
          channelType: JIRA_CLASSIC,
          destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
          key: FIELD_NAME
          constraints: [
            {
              key: "project",
              value: YOUR_PROJECT_VALUE
            }
          ]
        ) {
          entities {
            value
          }
          error
        }
      }
    }
```
The chosen values will be used as constraints to fetch the schema:
```
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiNotifications {
        channelSchema(
          channelType: JIRA_CLASSIC,
          destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
          product:  YOUR_PRODUCT,
          constraints: [
            {
              key: "project",
              value: YOUR_PROJECT_VALUE
            },
            {
              key: "issuetype",
              value: YOUR_ISSUE_TYPE_VALUE
            }
         ]
        ) {
          schema {
              fields {
                mandatory
                label
                key
                component
              }
            }
            result
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
After you've fetched each field and chosen a value from the suggestions or as free text, you can create a channel:
```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsCreateChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channel: {
    type: JIRA,
    name: "Channel Name",
    destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
    product: YOUR_PRODUCT,
    properties: [
      {
        key: YOUR_FIELD_NAME,
        value: YOUR_FIELD_NAME,
      },
      // ... And so forth with the rest of the fields
    ]
  }) {
    channel {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="servicenow"
    title="ServiceNow (Incident-Management)"
  >
ServiceNow is a configurable ticketing system, and therefore there's no static way to create this channel.

The schema must be fetched like shown above, then each field must be filled with free text or by using suggestions:

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      aiNotifications {
        channelSchema(
          channelType: SERVICE_NOW,
          destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
          product:  YOUR_PRODUCT,
          constraints: []
        ) {
          schema {
              fields {
                mandatory
                label
                key
                component
              }
            }
            result
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

After you've fetched each field and chosen a value from the suggestions or as free text, you can create a channel:

```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsCreateChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channel: {
    type: SERVICE_NOW,
    name: "Channel Name",
    destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
    product: YOUR_PRODUCT,
    properties: [
      {
        key: YOUR_FIELD_NAME,
        value: YOUR_FIELD_NAME,
      },
      // ... And so forth with the rest of the fields
    ]
  }) {
    channel {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

    destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
    product: YOUR_PRODUCT,
    properties: [
      {
        key: "channelId",
        value: YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID

    properties: [
      {
      key:"payload",
      value: "{\"key\":\"value\"}"}
    ]

PagerDuty has two types of integrations, service level and account level. For more information see the [PagerDuty integration docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations#pagerduty).

Service level:
```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsCreateChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channel: {
    type: PAGERDUTY_SERVICE_INTEGRATION,
    name: "Channel Name",
    destinationId: YOUR_DESTINATION_ID,
    product: YOUR_PRODUCT,
    properties: [
      {

        value: YOUR_PAGE_SUMMARY
      }
    ]
  }) {
    channel {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Account level:
```

    channel {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Update a channel [#update-channel]

When you update a channel, note that you don't need to supply all of the attributes on the channel. For example, if you only want to update the name, that's the only attribute you need to update, as shown here:

```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsUpdateChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channelId: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, channel: {
    name: "Updated channel Name"
  }) {
    channel {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing a channel [#test-channel]

You can test channels via the NerdGraph API. This can be done before or after creating the channel.

```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsTestChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channel: {
    type: PAGERDUTY_SERVICE_INTEGRATION,
    name: "Channel Name",
    properties: [
      {
        key: "summary",
        value: YOUR_PAGE_SUMMARY
      }
    ]
  }) {
    error {
      details
    }
    details
    result
  }
}

```

```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsTestChannelById(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channelId: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) {
    error {
      details
    }
    details
    result
  }
}

```
## Delete a channel [#delete-channel]

You can delete channels via the NerdGraph API.

```
mutation {
  aiNotificationsDeleteChannel(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, channelId: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) {
    ids
    error {
      details
    }
  }
}
```
