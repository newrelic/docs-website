You can use NerdGraph at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to create, query, and manage your [data partition rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/) for logs. NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API explorer.

This document includes:

* [The data partition rule schema](#data-partition-schema)
* [An example query of data partition rules](#query-data-partition-rules) 
* [How to create a data partition rule](#create-data-partition-rules)
* [How to update a data partition rule](#update-data-partition-rules)
* [How to delete a data partition rule](#delete-data-partition-rules)

## Data partition rule schema [#data-partition-schema]

Available data partition rule fields include:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
      Fields
    </th>
    <th>
      Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>Unique data partition rule identifier.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>targetDataPartition</td>
    <td>The name of the data partition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>description</td>
    <td>A description of what this data partition rule represents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>matchingCriteria</td>
    <td>The matching criteria for this data partition rule. Once the rule is enabled, logs matching this criteria will be routed to the specified data partition.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>retentionPolicy</td>
    <td>The retention policy of the data partition data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createdAt</td>
    <td>The date and time the rule was created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createdBy</td>
    <td>The user who created the rule.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>updatedAt</td>
    <td>The date and time the rule was last changed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>updatedBy</td>
    <td>The user who last updated the rule.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>enabled</td>
    <td>Whether or not this data partition rule is enabled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>deleted</td>
    <td>Whether or not this data partition rule has been deleted. Deleting a data partition rule does not delete the
      already routed logs.
    </td>
  </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Example query of data partitions rules [#query-data-partition-rules]

This NerdGraph API request example gets all of the data partition rules for a given account. In this example, only a few fields are requested.

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: 123456) {
      logConfigurations {
        dataPartitionRules {
          id
          targetDataPartition
          description
          matchingCriteria {
            attributeName
            matchingOperator
            matchingExpression
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create data partitions rules [#create-data-partition-rules]

This example creates a new data partition rule. Before creating the rule, be sure to review our documentation about [organizing data with partitions](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/).

```
mutation {
	logConfigurationsCreateDataPartitionRule(
	  accountId: 1123456,
    rule: {
      targetDataPartition: "Log_aNewDataPartitionRule",
      description: "Example data partition rule",
      matchingCriteria: {
        attributeName: "attribute",
        matchingMethod: LIKE,
        matchingExpression: "'%example%'"
      },
      retentionPolicy: STANDARD,
      enabled: true
    }) {
   	rule {
      id
      targetDataPartition
      description
    }
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Update data partitions rules [#update-data-partition-rules]

This example updates the data partition rule with the given id `"123"`. The fields that can be updated are `description`, `matchingCriteria`, and `enabled`. All of them are optional, so you only need to use the ones you want to update.

```
mutation {
	logConfigurationsUpdateDataPartitionRule(
	  accountId: 1123456,
    rule: {
      id: "123",
      description: "Example data partition rule",
      matchingCriteria: {
        attributeName: "attribute",
        matchingMethod: LIKE,
        matchingExpression: "'%example%'"
      },
      enabled: true
    }) {
   	rule {
      id
      targetDataPartition
      description
    }
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Delete data partitions rules [#delete-data-partition-rules]

This example deletes a data partition rule. Deleting a data partition rule doesn't delete data that has already been partitioned. That data is retained for a given period of time defined by the `retentionPolicy` field.

```
mutation {
logConfigurationsDeleteDataPartitionRule(id: "1111", accountId: 123456) {
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```
