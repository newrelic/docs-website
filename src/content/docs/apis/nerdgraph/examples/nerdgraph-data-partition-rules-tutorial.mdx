You can use NerdGraph at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to create, query, and manage your [data partition rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/) for logs. NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API explorer.

## Data partition rule schema [#data-partition-schema]

Available data partition rule fields include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
        Fields
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        id
      </td>

      <td>
        Unique data partition rule identifier.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        targetDataPartition
      </td>

      <td>
        The name of the data partition.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        description
      </td>

      <td>
        A description of what this data partition rule represents.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        matchingCriteria
      </td>

      <td>
        The matching criteria for this data partition rule. Once the rule is enabled, logs matching this criteria will be routed to the specified data partition.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        retentionPolicy
      </td>

      <td>
        The retention policy of the data partition data.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        createdAt
      </td>

      <td>
        The date and time the rule was created.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        createdBy
      </td>

      <td>
        The user who created the rule.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        updatedAt
      </td>

      <td>
        The date and time the rule was last changed.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        updatedBy
      </td>

      <td>
        The user who last updated the rule.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        enabled
      </td>

      <td>
        Whether or not this data partition rule is enabled.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        deleted
      </td>

      <td>
        Whether or not this data partition rule has been deleted. Deleting a data partition rule does not delete the
        already routed logs.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Example query of data partitions rules [#query-data-partition-rules]

This NerdGraph API request example gets all of the data partition rules for a given account. In this example, only a few fields are requested.

```
{
  actor {
    account(id: 123456) {
      logConfigurations {
        dataPartitionRules {
          id
          targetDataPartition
          description
          matchingCriteria {
            attributeName
            matchingOperator
            matchingExpression
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create data partitions rules [#create-data-partition-rules]

This example creates a new data partition rule. Before creating the rule, be sure to review our documentation about [organizing data with partitions](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/).

```
mutation {
	logConfigurationsCreateDataPartitionRule(
	  accountId: 1123456,
    rule: {
      targetDataPartition: "Log_aNewDataPartitionRule",
      description: "Example data partition rule",
      matchingCriteria: {
        attributeName: "attribute",
        matchingMethod: LIKE,
        matchingExpression: "'%example%'"
      },
      retentionPolicy: STANDARD,
      enabled: true
    }) {
   	rule {
      id
      targetDataPartition
      description
    }
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Update data partitions rules [#update-data-partition-rules]

This example updates the data partition rule with the given id `"123"`. The fields that can be updated are `description`, `matchingCriteria`, and `enabled`. All of them are optional, so you only need to use the ones you want to update.

```
mutation {
	logConfigurationsUpdateDataPartitionRule(
	  accountId: 1123456,
    rule: {
      id: "123",
      description: "Example data partition rule",
      matchingCriteria: {
        attributeName: "attribute",
        matchingMethod: LIKE,
        matchingExpression: "'%example%'"
      },
      enabled: true
    }) {
   	rule {
      id
      targetDataPartition
      description
    }
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Delete data partitions rules [#delete-data-partition-rules]

This example deletes a data partition rule. Deleting a data partition rule doesn't delete data that has already been partitioned. That data is retained for a given period of time defined by the `retentionPolicy` field.

```
mutation {
logConfigurationsDeleteDataPartitionRule(id: "1111", accountId: 123456) {
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```
