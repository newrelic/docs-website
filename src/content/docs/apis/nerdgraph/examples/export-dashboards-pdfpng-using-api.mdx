Do you need to schedule reports that contain charts or dashboards? Do you want to automate how you share dashboards? You can obtain your dashboards as PDF or PNG files programmatically with a [GraphQL](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) mutation.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also [export dashboards as PDF files using the UI](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard#dash-export).
</Callout>

## Export single-page dashboards [#dash-single]

If your dashboard has [a single page](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard#add-pages):

1. Obtain the dashboard's GUID: Click the <Icon name="fe-info"/>
   icon by the dashboard's name to access the **See metadata and manage tags** modal and see the dashboard's GUID.
2. Run the **dashboardCreateSnapshotURL** mutation in the [NerdGraphQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) with the GUID as a parameter.
3. Get the link to retrieve your dashboard as a PDF. The link looks similar to:
```
https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=PDF&width=2000&height=2000
```
4. [Configure](#configure) the exported file, if necessary.

## Export multiple-page dashboards [#dash-multiple]

For dashboards with multiple pages, first you need to obtain the GUID for each individual page:

1. Obtain the parent GUID (that is, the GUID in the **See metadata and manage tags** modal).
2. Get the individual pages' GUIDs using the query below:

   ```
   {
    actor {
       entitySearch(query: "parentId ='<var>YOUR_PAGE_GUID</var>'") {
         results {
           entities {
             guid
             name
             ... on DashboardEntityOutline {
               guid
               name
               dashboardParentGuid
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Run the mutation for each page to get the PDF for all dashboards.

## Configure the file you retrieve [#configure]

Edit the returned link to change the format of your export (PDF or PNG), or resize it.

For example, if you obtain the link:

```
https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=<mark>PDF</mark>&<mark>width=2000&height=2000</mark>
``` 

You could:

* Substitute `PDF` for `PNG` to get an image.
* Modify the width and height fields to adjust the size to your needs. The maximum value is `2000`.
