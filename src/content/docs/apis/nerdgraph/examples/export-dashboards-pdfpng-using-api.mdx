Do you need to schedule reports that contain charts or dashboards? Do you want to automate how you share dashboards? You can obtain your dashboards as PDF or PNG files programmatically with a [GraphQL](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) mutation. You can also [export dashboards as PDF files using the UI](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard#dash-export).

For example, You can generate static, snapshot versions of your New Relic dashboards and send them to Slack or download as files. To learn how, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 4 minutes).

## Export dashboard pages [#dash-multiple]

1. Obtain the dashboard's GUID: Click the <Icon name="fe-info"/>
   icon by the dashboard's name to access the **See metadata and manage tags** modal and see the dashboard's GUID.
2. Get the individual pages' GUIDs using the query below:

   ```
   {
    actor {
       entitySearch(query: "parentId ='<var>YOUR_PAGE_GUID</var>'") {
         results {
           entities {
             guid
             name
             ... on DashboardEntityOutline {
               guid
               name
               dashboardParentGuid
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Run the **dashboardCreateSnapshotURL** mutation in the [NerdGraphQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) as many times as dashboard pages you want to export. You just need to provide the desired dashboard page GUID as a parameter.
4. Get the link to retrieve your dashboard page as a PDF. The link looks similar to:
```
https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=PDF&width=2000&height=2000
```
5. [Configure](#configure) the exported file, if necessary.

## Configure the file you retrieve [#configure]

Edit the returned link to change the format of your export (PDF or PNG), or resize it.

For example, if you obtain the link:

```
https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=<mark>PDF</mark>&<mark>width=2000&height=2000</mark>
``` 

You could:

* Substitute `PDF` for `PNG` to get an image.
* Modify the width and height fields to adjust the size to your needs. The maximum value is `2000`.
