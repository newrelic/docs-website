Do you need to schedule reports that contain charts or dashboards? Do you want to automate how you share dashboards? You can obtain your <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> as PDF or PNG files programmatically with a [GraphQL](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) mutation. You can also [export dashboards as PDF files using the UI](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard#dash-export).

For example, you can generate static, [snapshot versions](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-dashboards/#other-operations) of your New Relic dashboards and send them to [Slack](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations/#slack) or [download as files](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/export-dashboards-pdfpng-using-api/).

## Export dashboard pages [#dash-multiple]

1. Obtain the dashboard's GUID: Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon by the dashboard's name to access the metadata widget and see the dashboard's GUID.

2. Get the individual pages' GUIDs using the query below:

   ```graphql
   {
    actor {
       entitySearch(query: "id ='YOUR_PAGE_GUID' OR parentId ='YOUR_PAGE_GUID' AND tags.isDashboardPage = 'true'" ) {
         results {
           entities {
             guid
             name
             ... on DashboardEntityOutline {
               guid
               name
               dashboardParentGuid
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run the <DNT>**dashboardCreateSnapshotURL**</DNT> mutation in the [NerdGraphQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) as many times as dashboard pages you want to export. You just need to provide the desired dashboard page GUID as a parameter.

4. Get the link to retrieve your dashboard page as a PDF. The link looks similar to:

   ```
   https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=PDF&width=2000&height=2000
   ```

5. [Configure](#configure) the exported file, if necessary.

## Configure the file you retrieve [#configure]

Edit the returned link to change the format of your export (PDF or PNG), or resize it.

For example, if you obtain the link:

```
https://gorgon.nr-assets.net/image/e0c22263-2d88-40bc-940a-b885dbc1d98d?format=PDF&width=2000&height=2000
```

You could:

* Substitute `PDF` for `PNG` to get an image.
* Modify the width and height fields to adjust the size to your needs. The maximum value is `2000`.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

Here's what to do if you experience any of the following errors while trying to export a dashboard:

* From New Relic UI: <DNT>**We ran into an error while creating the PDF. Please try again**</DNT>

* From New Relic NerdGraph: <DNT>**Operation on dashboard entity failed with guid:YOUR_GUID with cause: Error 504 calling Gorgon with url [https://chart-image.service.newrelic.com/dashboard-url-from-guid/YOUR_GUID](https://chart-image.service.newrelic.com/dashboard-url-from-guid/YOUR_GUID): upstream request timeout**</DNT>

These errors can be caused if the generation of the PDF exceeds the API max response time. If you encounter these errors, check if any of the widgets on your dashboard have a large time window. For example, you might compare data from an entire month versus previous months. If you see a large time window, try decreasing the window.

Another possible cause of these errors is that your dashboard may have a large number of widgets. If you have widgets you don't use, you might try removing some to see if this resolves the error.
