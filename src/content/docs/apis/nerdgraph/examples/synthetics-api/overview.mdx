Synthetic monitors help you proactively check your applications, services, and endpoints to ensure they're working properly. You can automate the management of your [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/), [private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations/), [secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests/), and [monitor downtimes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/) using [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).

With the appropriate permissions and access, you can programmatically manage your entire synthetic monitoring setup through queries and mutations in NerdGraph. Alternatively, you can perform these operations via the [New Relic UI](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/).

<Callout variant="important">
  As of August 26, 2024, you can no longer create new monitors using legacy runtimes on public or private locations. On October 22, 2024, we will [end of life](/whats-new/2024/04/whats-new-04-09-eol-synthetics-runtime-cpm) the containerized private minion (CPM) and legacy synthetics runtime versions.

  * For public locations, use [the runtime upgrade UI](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/runtime-upgrade-ui/) to update your monitors to the newest runtimes.
  * For private locations, please review our [recommended migration steps](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/#monitorMigration) to avoid monitor degradation.
</Callout>

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include:

* A [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). You'll need your API user key from this account to authenticate [mutations and queries](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).
* [General NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication).
* Relevant user permissions: You need the same [synthetic monitoring permissions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/user-roles-synthetic-monitoring) for NerdGraph as you do for the synthetics UI.

## Get started [#get-started]

To start using the NerdGraph API for synthetic monitoring:

1. Go to the [NerdGraph GraphQL Explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql)
2. Obtain your [API user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key) for authentication
3. Choose your monitor type or operation from the guides below
4. Use the provided GraphQL mutations and queries to manage your synthetic monitoring infrastructure

## Monitor types [#monitor-types]

New Relic provides several monitor types to suit different testing needs. Each monitor type has specific capabilities and use cases:

### Browser-based monitors

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Monitor Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Use Cases</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[Ping monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/ping-monitor)</td>
      <td>Simple availability checks that verify an endpoint is accessible</td>
      <td>Basic uptime monitoring, health checks, API availability</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Simple browser monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/simple-browser-monitor)</td>
      <td>Browser-based page load test without custom scripting</td>
      <td>Website availability, page load performance, basic user experience</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Scripted browser monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/scripted-browser-monitor)</td>
      <td>Custom JavaScript to simulate complex user interactions in a real browser</td>
      <td>Login flows, multi-step user journeys, complex web application testing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Step monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/step-monitor)</td>
      <td>Codeless, multi-step browser testing using predefined actions</td>
      <td>Common workflows without scripting, click-through testing, form submissions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### API and certificate monitors

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Monitor Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Use Cases</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[Scripted API monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/scripted-api-monitor)</td>
      <td>Custom JavaScript to test APIs without a browser</td>
      <td>REST API testing, GraphQL endpoints, backend service monitoring</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Certificate check monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/certificate-check-monitor)</td>
      <td>Monitors SSL/TLS certificate validity and expiration</td>
      <td>SSL certificate expiration alerts, security compliance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Broken links monitor](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/broken-links-monitor)</td>
      <td>Crawls a website to identify broken links</td>
      <td>Website health checks, SEO maintenance, link validation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Supporting entities [#supporting-entities]

In addition to monitors, you can manage supporting infrastructure and configuration:

* [Private locations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/private-locations) - Create monitoring locations behind your firewall for internal applications
* [Secure credentials](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/secure-credentials) - Store sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely
* [Monitor downtimes](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/monitor-downtimes) - Schedule maintenance windows when monitors should pause

## Query operations [#query-operations]

Each monitor type and supporting entity page includes query examples to retrieve information about your synthetic monitoring setup:

* **Monitor queries**: Each monitor type page includes examples for querying monitors, retrieving scripts/steps, and mapping monitor IDs to entity GUIDs
* **Private location queries**: The [private locations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/private-locations) page includes examples for querying location configurations
* **Secure credential queries**: The [secure credentials](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/secure-credentials) page includes examples for listing credential metadata
* **Monitor downtime queries**: The [monitor downtimes](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/synthetics-api/monitor-downtimes) page includes examples for viewing scheduled downtimes
