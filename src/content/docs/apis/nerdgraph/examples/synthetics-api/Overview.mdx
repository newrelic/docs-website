Synthetic monitors help you proactively check your applications, services, and endpoints to ensure they're working properly. You can automate the management of your [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/), [private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations/), [secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests/), and [monitor downtimes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/) using [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).

With the appropriate permissions and access, you can programmatically manage your entire synthetic monitoring setup through queries and mutations in NerdGraph. Alternatively, you can perform these operations via the [New Relic UI](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/).

<Callout variant="important">
  As of August 26, 2024, you can no longer create new monitors using legacy runtimes on public or private locations. On October 22, 2024, we will [end of life](/whats-new/2024/04/whats-new-04-09-eol-synthetics-runtime-cpm) the containerized private minion (CPM) and legacy synthetics runtime versions.

  * For public locations, use [the runtime upgrade UI](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/runtime-upgrade-ui/) to update your monitors to the newest runtimes.
  * For private locations, please review our [recommended migration steps](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/#monitorMigration) to avoid monitor degradation.

To get started with NerdGraph synthetic monitoring operations, go to [GraphQL Explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql) and follow these instructions.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include:

* A [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). You'll need your API user key from this account to authenticate [mutations and queries](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).
* [General NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication).
* Relevant user permissions: You need the same [synthetic monitoring permissions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/user-roles-synthetic-monitoring) for NerdGraph as you do for the synthetics UI.
