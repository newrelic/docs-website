As an alternative to [using the New Relic UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts), you can use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to view your organization's accounts, as well as create, rename, or cancel accounts.

## Requirements [#requirements]

For requirements to manage organization-level settings via NerdGraph, see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

## Before you start [#concepts]

Before you use NerdGraph to manage your accounts, it will probably help you to understand:

* [What accounts are and what they're used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure)
* That you can also [manage and add accounts via the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).
* [The basics of using NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph)
* That you can [track changes to your New Relic account](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent)

## Tips on terms and fields [#field-definitions]

Some tips about some of the fields used in these requests:

* The `managedAccount` and `managedAccounts` fields are simply terms for the accounts in an organization. They're synonymous with "accounts."
* The `regionCode` field refers to [the data center used by an account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center). Valid values are `us01` and `eu01` which map to the US and EU regions respectively.

Note that the [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#explorer) has built-in docs that defines fields.

## View accounts [#view-accounts]

Here's an example of returning the accounts in your organization:

```graphql
{
  actor {
    organization {
      accountManagement {
        managedAccounts {
          name
          id
          regionCode
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create accounts [#create-accounts]

Here's an example of how to create an account. Before creating an account, make sure you understand [what an account is used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementCreateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "NEW_ACCOUNT_NAME"}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

If you have a complex account structure you may use the optional `regionCode` parameter to target a specific data center.

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementCreateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "NEW_ACCOUNT_NAME", regionCode: "eu01"}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Rename an account [#rename-accounts]

Here's an example of how to rename an account.

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementUpdateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "UPDATED_ACCOUNT_NAME", id: 101010101}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Cancel an account [#cancel-an-account]

If you no longer want to keep an account active, you can cancel it using NerdGraph. The option to cancel an account is only available with NerdGraph. You can't cancel an account in the UI.

Before you cancel an account, review the effects of [cancelling an account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account). Once you're sure you want to cancel an account, you can use this mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementCancelAccount(id: $accountId) {
    id
    isCanceled
    name
    regionCode
  }
}
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  As an alternative to cancelling an account, consider [removing a monitored entity](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/#delete-entities).

## Errors [#errors]

Here are some errors and what they mean:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="fcenter">
        <DNT>
          **Error message**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th className="fcenter">
        <DNT>
          **Likely cause**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ```"unauthorized", {
              extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "ACCESS_DENIED" } }
            }
        ```
      </td>

      <td>
        This points to a problem with your organization structure (for example, an account that is outside the boundaries of an organization). If you get this message, contact [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal) or your account representative.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ```
        cannot create subaccount -- multiple parent account ids found. Please use Partnership API.", {
                extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "SERVER_ERROR" } }
              }
        ```
      </td>

      <td>
        This is a message returned when your organization has more than one "parent account," which is an indicator that your organization has a complex account structure that was set up with the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api) and requires the use of that API. Have questions? Contact [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal) or your account representative.
