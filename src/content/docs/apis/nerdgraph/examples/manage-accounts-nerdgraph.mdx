As an alternative to [using the New Relic UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts), you can use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to view your organization's accounts, create accounts, and rename accounts. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

For requirements to manage organization-level settings via NerdGraph, see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

## Before you start [#concepts]

Before you use NerdGraph to manage your accounts, it will probably help you to understand:

* [What accounts are and what they're used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure)
* That you can also [manage and add accounts via the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts). 
* [The basics of using NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph)
* That you can [track changes to your New Relic account](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent)  

This tutorial will show you how to: 

* View accounts 
* Rename accounts
* Add accounts

## Tips on terms and fields [#field-definitions]

Some tips about some of the fields used in these requests: 
* The `managedAccount` and `managedAccounts` fields are simply terms for the accounts in an organization. They're synonymous with "accounts."
* The `regionCode` field refers to [the data center used by an account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center). Valid values are `us01` and `eu01` which map to the US and EU regions respectively.

Note that the [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#explorer) has built-in docs that defines fields.

## View accounts [#view-accounts]

Here's an example of returning the accounts in your organization: 

```graphql
{
  actor {
    organization {
      accountManagement {
        managedAccounts {
          name
          id
          regionCode
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create accounts [#create-accounts]

Here's an example of how to create an account. Before creating an account, make sure you understand [what an account is used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementCreateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "NEW_ACCOUNT_NAME"}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

If you have a complex account structure you may use the optional `regionCode` parameter to target a specific data center.

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementCreateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "NEW_ACCOUNT_NAME", regionCode: "eu01"}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Rename an account [#rename-accounts]

Here's an example of how to rename an account. 

```graphql
mutation {
  accountManagementUpdateAccount(managedAccount: {name: "UPDATED_ACCOUNT_NAME", id: 101010101}) {
    managedAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Errors [#errors]

Here are some errors and what they mean: 

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th className="fcenter">
            **Error message**
          </th>

          <th className="fcenter">
            **Likely cause**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
```"unauthorized", {
      extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "ACCESS_DENIED" } }
    }
```
</td>

<td>
This points to a problem with your organization structure (for example, an account that is outside the boundaries of an organization). If you get this message, contact [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal) or your account representative. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>
```
cannot create subaccount -- multiple parent account ids found. Please use Partnership API.", {
        extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "SERVER_ERROR" } }
      }
```
          </td>

          <td>
This is a message returned when your organization has more than one "parent account," which is an indicator that your organization has a complex account structure that was set up with the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api) and requires the use of that API. Have questions? Contact [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal) or your account representative. 
</td>
        </tr>
        
<tr>

          <td>

</td>
        </tr>        
</tbody>
</table>

## Delete an account [#delete]

You currently cannot delete accounts using NerdGraph. Instead, try these related options: 

* [Downgrade or canceling accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account)
* [Remove a monitored entity](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/#delete-entities)
