When you're working with New Relic, you might need to store sensitive information like API keys and application credentials. In New Relic, these are called secrets. The <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> provides a secure way to store and retrieve these secrets in a centralized location through our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).

<Callout variant="important">

You can store secrets only in string format.

</Callout>

The key features of the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> are:

* **Unique keys for secrets**: You can prevent accidental exposure of secrets by assigning a unique key to each one when storing. Use the key to retrieve and manage the secrets.

* **Secrets stored  at [account or organization level](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/)**:
To access and use a secret across multiple accounts, you can store it at the organization level. If a secret is specific to a single account, you can store it at the account level.

* **Versions of secrets**: You can update a secret without losing the previous version. The <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> tracks all versions of a secret.

* **Controlled deletion and recovery of secrets**: The service allows recoverable deletion of secrets. Users without the Purge permission can soft-delete secrets. Permanent deletion is restricted to users with the Purge permission.

* **Standard secrets with role-based access**: Standard secrets are accessible to all users with permissions in the account or organization. Admins control access by assigning custom roles with permission levels ranging from <DNT>**View**</DNT> to <DNT>**Purge**</DNT>.

* **Sharable secrets with fine-grained access**: Sharable secrets are private by default to the creator, who can grant specific permissions (read, update, delete) to individual users, groups, or system identities. Organization admins retain full access to all sharable secrets for oversight and management.

## Secrets management services billing [#secrets-management-services-billing]

The <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when NerdGraph queries are executed to store, retrieve, or manage secrets.

## Standard secrets access control [#security-and-access-control]

Users with [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) can access the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> specific to the accounts they have access to, with the following permissions.

* **Read Only**: Users can only retrieve secrets. They can't create, update, or delete secrets.

* **Standard User**: Users can create, update, retrieve, and soft-delete secrets.

* **All Product Admin**: Users have full access to the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT>. They can create, update, retrieve, soft-delete, permanently delete, and fetch the list of secrets.

* **Billing User**: Users can only fetch the list of secrets.


To manage secrets at the account level with a non-standard role, ask your admin to [create a custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) with the necessary permissions, and assign them to your user group.

For managing secrets at the organization level, ask your admin to create an [org-scoped custom role via the NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#create-role), add the required permissions, and assign it to the user group. [Organization Manager](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) have default permissions at the organization level, but to allow them to manage secrets, ask your admin to assign them a custom role specific to the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT>.

<Callout variant="important">

Setup and configure the users, roles, permissions, and access to the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> at the account and organization level, in accordance with your organization policies and requirements.

</Callout>

## Sharable secrets with fine-grained access [#sharable-secrets]

While standard secrets are accessible to all users with permissions in an account or organization, enterprises with multiple teams often need to restrict secrets to specific individuals. Sharable secrets address this need.

<Callout variant="important">
To work with sharable secrets, users must first have the base permissions described in [Standard secrets access control](#security-and-access-control). The fine-grained access permissions described below are **in addition to** those base requirements.
</Callout>

When you create a sharable secret, you automatically become its owner with full control. You can grant access to users, groups, or system identities by assigning individual permissions or by using roles that bundle multiple permissions together.

**Individual permissions (granted on top of base access):**

* **Read**: Retrieve the secret value
* **Update**: Change the secret value
* **Delete**: Remove the secret

**Predefined roles (granted on top of base access):**

* **Secret Owner**: Full control (read, update, delete, grant/revoke)
* **Secret Reader**: Read-only access

You can also [create custom roles]((/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles)) that combine specific permissions based on your needs. Organization admins retain full access to all sharable secrets for oversight.

When you need a synthetic monitor, workflow, or other automated process to access your secret, you grant access to its system identity. A system identity is a unique identifier assigned to each automated process in New Relic. When you link a secret to a monitor or workflow through the New Relic UI, the system identity for that automated process is used to control access at runtime.

<Callout variant="important">
Standard secrets cannot be converted into sharable secrets. To migrate an existing standard secret, create a new sharable secret with the same value, grant appropriate access, update your applications, and delete the old secret.
</Callout>

## Pre-requisites [#prerequisites]
 
To use the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT>, you need:

 * The [Advanced Compute](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) pricing plan
 * A [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
 * Your API user key for [queries and mutations]((https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology))
 * Appropriate permissions to create and manage secrets. Refer to [Standard secrets access control](#security-and-access-control) and [Sharable secrets with fine-grained access](#sharable-secrets) for details on required roles and permissions.

User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, refer [Factors affecting access](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions).

## Use the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> [#use-secrets-management-service]
From the [NerdGraph Explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer/), use [mutations and queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions) to interact with the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT>.

Here are the common attributes you will use in the mutations and queries:

### Operations[#operations]

The operations you can perform with the <DNT>Secrets management service</DNT> are organized into two categories:

<Callout variant="tip">
**Choosing between standard and sharable secrets:**

* Use **standard secrets** (`secretsManagementCreateSecret`) when you want to share a secret with all users who have access to the account or organization.
* Use **sharable secrets** (`secretsManagementCreateShareableSecret`) when you need to control exactly who can access a secret by granting permissions to specific users, groups, or system identities.

Use the `secretsManagementDeleteSecret` mutation to delete all versions of a secret. Only All Product Admins or a user having a custom role with `purge` permission can choose to delete secrets permanently. Other users can't delete secrets permanently. If you have not deleted the secret permanently, you can [recover it](#recover-secrets) using the `secretsManagementRecoverSecret` mutation.

Use `secretsManagementRecoverSecret` mutation to recover secrets that you have deleted using the `secretsManagementDeleteSecret` mutation before with the `purge` attribute set to `false`. If a secret is permanently deleted, you can't recover it.
