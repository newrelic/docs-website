When you're working with New Relic, you might need to store sensitive information like tokens, API keys, passwords, or certificates. In New Relic, these sensitive pieces of information are called secrets. The <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service provides a secure way to store and retrieve these secrets in a centralized location through our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/). You can store secrets only in string format.

For accessing external services and supported integrations, New Relic applications may need authentication credentials like API tokens or OAuth client details. These credentials must be securely stored in the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service to ensure that applications can access necessary functionality without compromising security.

<Callout variant="important">

Customer-specific secrets that are unrelated to New Relic approved functionality and integrations, such as third party or personal passwords, must never be stored in the secrets management service.

</Callout>

Following are the key features of the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service:

* **Assign unique keys to secrets**: Assign a unique key to each secret you store. This key is used to identify the secret when you want to retrieve or manage it later.

* **Store secrets at [account or organization level](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/)**: Choose to store a secret at the organization level if it needs to be accessed and used across multiple accounts. Alternatively, store it at the account level if the secret is specific to an account and doesn't need to be accessed or used when you're in another account.

* **Maintain multiple versions of secrets**: Update a secret without losing the previous version. The Secrets Management service tracks all versions of a secret, allowing you to retrieve up to 10 previous versions.

* **Soft delete and recover secrets**: Soft delete a secret to temporarily remove it, with the option to recover it later. This is useful if you accidentally delete a secret or need to restore a previous version. You can also purge a secret, which permanently removes it from the system.

* **Control access**: As an admin, you can define who can access the secret by setting custom roles and permissions, and specifying the scope of access. The scope can range from basic read-only access to purge access.

The <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when NerdGraph queries are executed to store, retrieve, or manage secrets.

## Access control[#security-and-access-control]
Users with [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) can access the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service specifc to the account they have access to, with the following permissions.

* **Read Only**: Users can only retrive secrets. They can not create, update or delete secrets.

* **Standard User**: Users can create, update, retrive and delete (soft delete) secrets.

* **All Product Admin**: Users have full access to the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service. They can create, update, retrive, delete (soft delete), purge, and fetch list of secrets.

* **Billing User**: Users can only fetch the list of secrets.

As a Full Platform Admin, you can [create custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) with the specific permissions to use the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service.

If you want a group of users to manage secrets at the organization level, assign the [Organization Manager](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) permission to them. This role allows users to create, update, retrieve, delete (soft delete), purge, and fetch the list of secrets at the organization level.

## Requirements[#review-requirements]
 
To use the secrets management service, you need:

 * A [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
 * Your API user key for [queries and mutations]((https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#terminology)).
 * User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, refer [Factors affecting access](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions).

## Use the secrets management service [#use-secrets-management-service]
From the [NerdGraph Explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer/), you need to use [mutations and queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions) to interact with the <dnt>Secrets management</dnt> service.

Here are the common attributes you will use in the mutations and queries:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Attribute name**

            <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

            String
            </td>
            <td>
             Description of the secret for easy identification.

            </td>
            <td>
             An unique key for the secret that you want to store. This key is used to identify the secret when you want to retrieve or manage it later.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
            `namespace`

            String
            </td>
            <td>
             Serves as a logical grouping of secrets, organizing and categorizing them to enhance management and prevent conflicts. This attribute is particularly beneficial in environments with multiple teams or projects using New Relic, as it streamlines organization and reduces the risk of overlap or confusion.

            </td>
            <td>
            
            
            The scope specifies the level at which your secret is stored and accessed, as well as the particular entity from which you can retrieve it. The scope is defined by two attributes:
             * `type`: determines the level at which your secret will be stored. If the secret is specific to a single account and doesn't need to be accessed from other accounts, select `Account`. If the secret needs to be accessed and used across multiple accounts, select `Organization`.  The `Organization` option will be available only when you have the [Organization Manager](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) permission.
             * `id`: Enter the corresponding ID of the account or organization from which you want to retrieve the secret.
            </td>
        </tr>

            <td>
             Functions as key-value pairs that add metadata to your entities, including applications, services, and hosts. By using tags, you enhance your ability to organize, filter, and manage these entities effectively. This organizational tool is particularly useful for sharing secrets within related entities, ensuring seamless integration and management.

            Deletes all versions of the secret. If set to `true`, it deletes the secret permanently; if set to `false`, you can recover the secret later with all its versions. You need necessary permissions to have this option. For more details, refer to the [Access control](#security-and-access-control) section.

            </td>
            <td>
            As you can store multiple versions of a secret, it identifies the version number of the secret for retrival or deletion.

Use the `secretsManagementDeleteSecret` mutation to delete all versions of a secret permanently or temporarily. Your assigned permissions determine the availability of these options. For more details, refer to the [Access control](#security-and-access-control) section. If you delete a secret temporarily, you can recover it using the `secretsManagementRecoverSecret` mutation. Review the data type and description of each attribute to understand their usage.
