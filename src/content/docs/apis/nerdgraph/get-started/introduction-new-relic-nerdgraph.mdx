NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you [sign up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and [install](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/install-new-relic/) any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph.

## What is NerdGraph? [#overview]

NerdGraph is one of several New Relic [APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis/). NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations ([learn more about features](#tutorials)). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic's various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph.

<Callout variant="important">
  NerdGraph isn't used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our [data ingest APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis/#data-type-apis).
</Callout>

NerdGraph is built using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Before you get started:

* You need a New Relic account, and with that account, you can access your API <InlinePopover type="userKey"/> that you need to include with queries and mutations.
* User type and assigned roles can affect your NerdGraph permissions. For more details, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data#user-permissions).

## Endpoints [#endpoints]

The API endpoint you use depends on your [data center region](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center):

<CONTRIBUTOR_NOTE>
  Do NOT change these GraphQL endpoints below unless you have the approval of the Unified API team.
</CONTRIBUTOR_NOTE>

* Main endpoint: `https://api.newrelic.com/graphql`
* Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: `https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql`

To access the endpoint, you could make calls from your code, use the [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer), or make a `curl` command similar to this:

<CONTRIBUTOR_NOTE>
  Do NOT change the GraphQL endpoint in this `curl` request unless you have the approval of the Unified API team.
</CONTRIBUTOR_NOTE>

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \
     -d '{ "query":  "{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }" }'
```

## Use the NerdGraph API explorer [#explorer]

An easy way to experiment with the NerdGraph API is to use the NerdGraph API explorer. For help getting started with this tool, see [NerdGraph API explorer tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer).

## NerdGraph functionality [#tutorials]

NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories:

* <DNT>**Querying data.**</DNT> You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a [New Relic app](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps) for custom data visualizations.
* <DNT>**Configuring features.**</DNT> There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize "golden metrics."

You can use NerdGraph to return and configure a wide range of data. One way to see what NerdGraph can do is to start building queries and exploring the schema using the [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer).

These are some of the most commonly used NerdGraph features:

* [Get data about your monitored entities](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial)
* [Query your data using NRQL](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial) (our query language)
* [Create dashboards](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/create-widgets-dashboards-api)

## NerdGraph terminology [#terminology]

The following are terms that originate with GraphQL, the API format NerdGraph uses.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Term
      </th>

      <th>
        Definition
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Queries and mutations
      </td>

      <td>
        There are two classes of GraphQL operations:

        * [Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries) are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema).
        * [Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword `mutation`, as well as the `name` of the mutation.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Type
      </td>

      <td>
        Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be [scalars](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types.

        An [object type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called `User` may represent a user in a system.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Field
      </td>

      <td>
        A [field](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a `User` object type could have a string field called `name`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Interface
      </td>

      <td>
        An [interface](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can `implement`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
