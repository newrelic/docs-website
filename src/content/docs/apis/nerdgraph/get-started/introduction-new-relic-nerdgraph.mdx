NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features.

## What is NerdGraph? [#overview]

New Relic has several [APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis/). NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations ([learn more about features](#tutorials)). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. 

<Callout variant="important">
NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our [data ingest APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis/#data-type-apis). 
</Callout>

NerdGraph is built using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. 

For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video:

## Use the GraphiQL explorer [#explorer]

To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. 
 
To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s **API key** dropdown.  
 
To find the GraphiQL explorer: 
 
* If your New Relic account uses an [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers), go to [api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql). 
* Otherwise use [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

For tips on how to build queries, see [Build queries](#make-query).

## Requirements and endpoints [#authentication]

To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic [user key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys), which can be generated and accessed from the [GraphiQL explorer](#explorer).

The endpoints are:
* Main endpoint: `https://api.newrelic.com/graphql`
* Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: `https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql`

To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command:

```
curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'API-Key: <var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</var>' \
-d '{ "query":  "{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }" } '
```

## What can you do with NerdGraph? [#tutorials]

NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: 

* **Querying New Relic data.** You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a [New Relic One app](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps) for custom data visualizations. 
* **Configuring New Relic features.** There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize "golden metrics."

You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases:

## NerdGraph terminology [#terminology]

The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Term
      </th>

      <th>
        Definition
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Queries and mutations
      </td>

      <td> 
There are two classes of GraphQL operations: 

* [Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
* [Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword `mutation`, as well as the `name` of the mutation. 

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Type
      </td>

      <td>
        Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be [scalars](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types.

        An [object type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called `User` may represent a user in a system.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Field
      </td>

      <td>
        A [field](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a `User` object type could have a string field called `name`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Interface
      </td>

      <td>
        An [interface](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can `implement`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer [#make-query]

You can make queries with the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-account-user"
    title="Query accounts a New Relic user can access"
  >
    You can query for the name of an account that an `actor` (a New Relic authorized user) has access to:

    ```
    query {
       actor {
          account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
             name
          }
       }
    }
    ```

    The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want.

    ```
    {
      "data": {
          "actor": {
             "account": {
                "name": "<var>Data Nerd</var>"
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-multiple-requests"
    title="Query user, account, and NRQL in one request"
  >
    The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints.

    ```
    query {
       actor {
          account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
             name
             nrql(query: "<a href="/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#state-select">SELECT</a> * <a href="/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-from">FROM</a> Transaction") {
                results
             }
          }
          user {
             name
             id
          }
       }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
