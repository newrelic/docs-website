NerdGraph is our main API for querying data and making configurations to New Relic features. One popular way to use NerdGraph and make API requests is with our NerdGraph explorer. 

## Find the explorer [#find]

To find the NerdGraph explorer: 

* In the EU: If your New Relic account uses an [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers), go to [api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql).
* Outside the EU: If your account is outside the EU, use [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

## What is the NerdGraph explorer? [#overview]

Our NerdGraph API is built using GraphQL, a third-party query language. Our NerdGraph explorer is built using GraphiQL, which is an open source graphical interface for forming and making GraphQL requests. 

You can use the NerdGraph explorer to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries.

To watch a short video showing how to use the explorer, see [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

## Before you begin 

Before you do the lessons here, be sure you've reviewed [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). 

Go to [the explorer](#find) and log in using your New Relic user ID and password.

Make sure you have a valid [New Relic user key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key). You can create one from the NerdGraph explorer or view and create them in the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

Next we'll walk you through some steps that will help you learn to use the explorer. 

## Step 1. Build a query to retrieve your name [#build-query]

Let's start with a simple NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database:

1. Erase everything in the query editor.
2. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: `actor`, `user`, `name`.

This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2. Click the play button to see the result [#click-play]

With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the `name` field, which is nested within the `user` field. This refers to the user who owns the [API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key), which in turn is nested within `actor`.

Click the **Play** button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the query builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the **Docs** button, or hover over a field in the editor.

  alt="NerdGraph docs and tooltips"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphInternalDocs}
/>

## Step 3. Add more fields to your query [#add-fields]

Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the query builder: The explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account `id` and `email` fields.

Running the query returns only the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching data. Notice that the `id` field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: 12345678)
  }
}
```

## Step 4. Experiment with mutations [#mutations]

In GraphQL, [mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (in REST APIs, these are commonly referred to as CRUD operations).

Ready for your first mutation?

1. Erase what's in the editor.
2. Scroll down the query builder and expand `mutation`.
3. Select the fields in the following screenshot:

<img
  title="Mutation example"
  alt="Mutation example"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphMutationExample}
/>


In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select `errors`: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses).

<Callout variant="tip">
Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get.
</Callout>

## Step 5. Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal [#query-terminal]

Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations:

1. Select the **Tools** menu.
2. Copy the query as a curl call or as a [New Relic CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/newrelic-cli) command.

<img
  title="NerdGraph tools menu"
  alt="NerdGraph tools menu"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphToolsMenu}
/>

```bash
# curl version
curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \
  --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  actor {\n    user {\n      name\n      email\n    }\n    account(id: 12345678)\n  }\n}\n", "variables":""}'

# New Relic CLI version
newrelic nerdgraph query '{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: 12345678)
  }
}'
```

## Next steps [#next-steps]

Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation.

Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the query builder (be careful with mutations though, as they could result in changes to your account). Check out some of the example requests in the section below.

## Other example requests [#more-examples]

Here are some other examples of NerdGraph requests that may be helpful: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-account-user"
    title="Query accounts a New Relic user can access"
  >
    You can query for the name of an account that an `actor` (a New Relic authorized user) has access to:

    ```graphql
    query {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want.

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "actor": {
          "account": {
            "name": "Data Nerd"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-multiple-requests"
    title="Query user, account, and NRQL in one request"
  >
    The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints.

    ```graphql
    query {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          name
          nrql(query: "SELECT * FROM Transaction") {
            results
          }
        }
        user {
          name
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
