Deprecated

Currently New Relic supports two versions of the REST API. Version 1 is **deprecated** and has been replaced with the newer v2. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications are being made to v1.

<Callout variant="important">
  Start new projects by referring to [Getting started with API v2](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) and the [New Relic REST API v2 examples](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2). Also, begin migrating your v1 scripts to their v2 equivalent.
</Callout>

To use the REST API v1 in any way, your [API key](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/api-key) is required. Then, from the command line, you can use:

```
curl -gH "x-api-key:REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY" 'ENDPOINT_URL'
```

OR

```
wget -qO- --header "x-api-key:REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY" 'ENDPOINT_URL'
```
