New Relic has several different [APIs](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis) that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them.

## Manage API keys in UI [#find]

Here's [a direct link to the API keys UI page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher). To find this from the New Relic UI:

1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**.
2. Select **API keys**.

## Overview of API keys [#types]

The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses.

<Callout variant="important">
  Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended.
</Callout>

## User key [#user-api-key]

New Relic user keys (previously referred to as "personal API keys") are required for [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api) (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2), with restrictions based on your permissions.

The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see [Manage keys with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-user-keys).

</Callout>

## License key [#ingest-license-key]

New Relic [license keys](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key) allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended.

The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see [Manage keys with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-user-keys).

    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Browser key [#ingest-browser-key]

The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring).

The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see [Manage keys with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-user-keys).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser

    <Callout variant="important">
      You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, [contact New Relic support](https://support.newrelic.com/).
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## REST API key

<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend using a [user key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key) to use the REST API because that key has fewer limitations.
</Callout>

You can use a REST API key with our [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2) and the [API Explorer](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/introduction-new-relics-rest-api-explorer). For parent accounts with sub-accounts, each [sub-account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/mastersub-account-structure) must use its own REST API key.

**Availability**: Each New Relic account can have only **one** REST API key.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="activate-rest-api"
    title="Activate or change REST API key"
  >
    1. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **REST API key**.
    2. Click **Regenerate REST API key**.
    3. Click **(Show key)** to view your account's new REST API key.
    4. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="view-rest-api"
    title="View REST API keys"
  >
    To view REST API keys:

    1. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **REST API key**.
    2. Click **(Show key)** to view your account's new REST API key.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-admin-key"
    title="Delete REST API key"
  >
    To delete your account's REST API key:

    1. Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account.
    2. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **REST API key**.
    3. Select the **delete** <Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       icon for the REST API key.
    4. Confirm the deletion by typing `DELETION IS FOREVER` in the text field.
    5. Select **Delete**.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Insights insert key

The Insights insert key (aka the "Insert key") is required for the ingestion of data via our [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api), [Log API](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs-http-input), [Metric API](/docs/introduction-new-relic-metric-api), and [Trace API](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-new-relic-trace-api), or via tools that use those APIs.

Tips on availability and access:

* Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it.
* As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="insert-key-create"
    title="Generate an Insights insert key"
  >
    1. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **Insights insert keys**.
    2. Next to the **Insert keys** heading, select the **<Icon name="fe-plus"/>** button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field.
    3. Edit the **NRQL** query field.
    4. Add comments in the **Notes** field if desired.
    5. Click **Save your notes**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="insert-key-edit-delete"
    title="Edit or delete an Insights insert key"
  >
    1. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **Insights insert keys**.
    2. Under **Insert Keys**, find the key you want to modify. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Insights query key

The Insights query key is used for our [Insights query API](/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api): w**e now recommend using [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) for querying New Relic data.**

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="x-query-key-create"
    title="Generate an Insights query key"
  >
    You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it.
    </Callout>

    To register this key:

    1. Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **Insights query keys**.
    2. Next to the **Query Keys** heading, select the **<Icon name="fe-plus"/>** button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field.
    3. Edit the **NRQL** query field.
    4. Add comments in the **Notes** field if desired.
    5. Click **Save your notes**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="x-query-key-edit-delete"
    title="Edit or delete an Insights query key"
  >
    To edit or delete this key:

    1. Go to the [API keys UI page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **Insights query keys**.
    2. Under **Query Keys**, find the key you want to modify. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Admin key [#admin_key]

<Callout variant="important">
  **As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys.**

  You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow.

  All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.
</Callout>
