Here is an example of how to use the New Relic API Explorer (v2) to get your application's average response time over a specified time period.

## Average response time [#average_response]

The average response time (milliseconds) is the value that appears on the main chart for your app on the [APM **Summary** page](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview). New Relic uses this formula to calculate response time:

```
Response time = HttpDispatcher:average_call_time + ((WebFrontend/Queue:call_count * WebFrontend/Queue:average_response_time) / HttpDispatcher:call_count)
```

To obtain the metric values, use the following two commands.

In these examples, the same time period has been used for each, and they are both summarized (averaged).

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml" \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}" -i \
     -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true'
```

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml" \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}" -i \
     -d 'names[]=WebFrontend/QueueTime&values[]=call_count&values[]=average_response_time&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true'
```

Your application may have zero queuing time for the time period in question. In that case, the `WebFrontend/QueueTime` metric will have a zero value.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If your app has **never** reported a queuing time, the metric `WebFrontend/QueueTime` will not exist.
</Callout>

## Response time [#app_rep_time]

On the [APM **Summary** page](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview), [Response time](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/response-time) is the overlaid line within the main chart for your app. To obtain the metric values shown by this line, use the same formula and two commands described above, but remove `summarize=true` from the commands.
