## Problem

Your REST API call returns a `301` error message that may include some or all of this information:

```
curl -X GET 'http://rpm.newrelic.com/v2/applications/1234567890.json' \
     -H 'X-Api-Key:REDACTED' -i
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Status: 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://rpm.newrelic.com/v2/applications/1234567890.json
...
You are being redirected https://rpm.newrelic.com/v2/applications/1234567890.json
```

OR

```
curl -X GET 'http://rpm.newrelic.com/v2/applications/1234567890.json' \
     -H 'X-Api-Key:REDACTED'
You are being redirected https://rpm.newrelic.com/v2/applications/1234567890.json
```

## Solution

New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to <InlinePopover type="apm"/> and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, change your script or program to HTTPS.
