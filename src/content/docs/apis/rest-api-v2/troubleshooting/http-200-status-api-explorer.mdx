## Problem

You received an `HTTP 200` status code, but the message body is empty.

## Solution

To correct this, add an `Accept` header containing `application/json` or `application/xml` to your `GET` request. For example:

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/metrics/data.json'
     -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i
     -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

## Cause

This may occur when using a default `GET` header that does not specify the accepted content type. For more information on HTTP headers, see this tutorial on [Content negotiation using HTTP headers](https://restfulapi.net/content-negotiation/).
