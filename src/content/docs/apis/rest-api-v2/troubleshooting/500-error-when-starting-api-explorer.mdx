## Problem

A `500` error appears when starting the API Explorer.

## Solution

To correct this, make sure you have a default account:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > ([user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings)) > User preferences**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Default account**</DNT> dropdown, select your choice, then save.

## Cause

This occurs when you do not have a current or valid default New Relic account associated with your login. This keeps the Explorer from displaying the API keys available to you.
