## Problem

A `500` error appears when starting the API Explorer.

## Solution

To correct this, make sure you have a default account:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > ([account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#account-dropdown)) > User preferences**.
2. From the **Default account** dropdown, select your choice, then save.

## Cause

This occurs when you do not have a current or valid default New Relic account associated with your login. This keeps the Explorer from displaying the API keys available to you.
