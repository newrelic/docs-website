New Relic's REST API Explorer (v2) makes it easy to test and send requests for any available API endpoint. After you select your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, etc.), the user interface provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. It also provides a live source of documentation about the API values.

## Provide your API key

Before you can use the API Explorer, API access must be activated and an [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key) must be generated for your account.

* If you are signed in to New Relic as an admin user on your account, when you use the API Explorer your API key will appear automatically in the **Request** and **Parameters** sections of the user interface.
* If you are not signed in to New Relic when you use the API Explorer, or you are not an Admin user but have been given the API Key, you can [paste your API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys#viewing) into the API Explorer's **Parameters**.

  For master accounts with [sub-accounts](/docs/subscriptions/creating-sub-accounts), each sub-account has its own API keys. Make sure you are using the correct one.
</Callout>
