To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string.

If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string.

## Prerequisites [#h2_prereqs]

This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include:

* Publicizing your integration code on Github.
* Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like [WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
* Offering an "as a service" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like [Runscope's integration](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/newrelic#connecting).

## User agents [#h2_user_agents]

When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an <DNT>**integration**</DNT> in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field <DNT>**User-Agent**</DNT>.

When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a <DNT>**User-Agent**</DNT> header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom <DNT>**User-Agent**</DNT> string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs.

By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track:

* Usage statistics for your integration.
* Potentially buggy or abusive API usage.

## Set a user agent [#h2_setting]

To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header <DNT>**User-Agent**</DNT>.

Examples:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={125}>
        <DNT>
          **Language**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **Example**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        cURL
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Java  
                                        (using GET)
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        get.setHeader("User-Agent", "my-integration/1.2.3");
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        PHP
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3');
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: `name/version`. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is:

```
name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​
```

For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration.

* <Icon name="fe-x"/>
  Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration
* <Icon name="fe-check"/>
  Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic

For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions.

Wrap comments in parentheses `()` as a semi-colon separated list;

Helpful comments to include:

* The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration.
* Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title="Set custom user-agent for your integration">
    You have an integration with the following identifying information:

    * Name: MetricMeter
    * Version: 3.2
    * URL: meter.me/info
    * Contact: [help@meter.me](mailto:help@meter.me)

      The custom user agent string would be:

      ```
      MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me)
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## User agent strings and New Relic [#h2_user_agent_usage]

New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source.

Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.
