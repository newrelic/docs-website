<Callout variant="tip">
  The use of the REST API for labels/tags is **deprecated**. For how to add tags, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).
</Callout>

## Create labels [#create_labels]

**The use of the REST API for labels/tags is deprecated.** For how to add tags, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).

Creating or applying a label with the REST API requires:

* The <var>NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</var> in the examples represents your [user key](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/rest-api-alerts/rest-api-calls-alerts#personal-api-key).
* The label must be applied to an existing [application ID](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/listing-your-app-id-metric-data-v2).
* The label must conform to the [guidelines for category labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/organize-your-data/labels-categories-organize-apps-servers-monitors#guidelines).

Use a command similar to the following example to apply a label to an application that exists in your account. Substitute your user key and the [application id](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/identification-code) in the example.

You can use this command to apply the same label to applications and hosts simultaneously. You can also omit the `"applications":` section if not needed.

```
curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels.json' \
     -H "Api-Key:<var>NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</var>" -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d \
'{
  "label": {
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Web01",
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        123456,7898765     <---<< application ids
      ],
    }
  }
}'
```

### Create label: View the output [#create_label_output]

The output for creating or applying a label will appear similar to the following example for a single application. The label output includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Production:Main`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and the application IDs for the label in each category; for example, the health status for app ID 546917 is green (the app is fine)
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Production:Main` has been applied to one application (546917)

```
{
  "label": {
    "key": "Production:Main",
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Main",
    "application_health_status": {
      "green": [
        546917        <---application id
      ],
      "orange": [],
      "red": [],
      "gray": []
    },
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        546917        <--- application id
      ],
    }
  },
...
}
```

### Create label return status [#return_status]

There are two possible return statuses when creating labels:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Return status
      </th>

      <th>
        Definition
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        201 Create
      </td>

      <td>
        A label was successfully created.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        304 Not Modified
      </td>

      <td>
        There was an attempt to re-create an existing label, but no change was needed or made.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## List existing labels [#list_labels]

**The use of the REST API for labels/tags is deprecated.** For how to use tags, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).

To list the labels that exist in your account, use this command:

```
curl 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels.json' \
     -H "Api-Key:<var>NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</var>" -i
```

### View the output [#list_label_output]

The output for the label includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Staging:Test1`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and application IDs for the label in each category
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Staging:Test1` has been applied to one application (4937390) and two hosts (3801143 and 5879721)

The output for a label listing will appear similar to this:

```
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "key": "Production:Main",
      "category": "Production",
      "name": "Main",
      "application_health_status": {
        "green": [],
        "orange": [],
        "red": [],
        "gray": []
      },
      "links": {
        "applications": [],
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "Staging:Test1",
      "category": "Staging",
      "name": "Test1",
      "application_health_status": {
        "green": [],
        "orange": [],
        "red": [
          4937390
        ],
        "gray": []
      },
      "links": {
        "applications": [
          4937390
        ],
      }
    },
...
}
```

## Delete labels [#delete_labels]

**The use of the REST API for labels/tags is deprecated.** For how to use tags, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).

<Callout variant="caution">
  This API call will remove **all** instances of the label from both applications and hosts. If you want to remove a label from a specific application or host, you must use the [New Relic UI](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).
</Callout>

Use a command similar to the following example to delete a label from your account.

```
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels/Production:Main.json' \
     -H "Api-Key:<var>NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</var>" -i
```

You can also use the New Relic REST API Explorer (v2) to [delete labels](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/labels/delete).

### Deleting: view the output [#delete_label_output]

The output for deleting a label will appear similar to the following example for a single application. This example will delete the label `Production:Main` from all locations where it was applied for the account's [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key).

The output for deleting labels includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Production:Main`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and the IDs for the label in each category; for example, the health status for app ID 546917 is green (the app is fine)
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Production:Main` has been removed from one application (546917)

```
{
  "label": {
    "key": "Production:Main",
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Main",
    "application_health_status": {
      "green": [
        546917
      ],
      "orange": [],
      "red": [],
      "gray": []
    },
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        546917
      ],
    }
  },
  ....
}
```

### Delete return status [#return_status]

There are two possible return statuses when deleting labels:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Return status**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Definition**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        200 OK
      </td>

      <td>
        An attempt to delete a label was successful.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        404 Not Modified
      </td>

      <td>
        An attempt was made to delete a non-existent label.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
