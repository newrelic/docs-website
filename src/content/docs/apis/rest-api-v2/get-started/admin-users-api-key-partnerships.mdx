This approach adds a new authentication method to the customer-facing [New Relic REST API (v2)](https://api.newrelic.com/) that allows partners (and enterprise-scale customers that use the partnership structure to manage their multiple accounts) to use their partnership credentials to authorize all REST API (v2) calls. It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users.

When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the <InlinePopover type="userKey" />, New Relic suggests you use the described [authentication method](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/admins-api-key-partnerships#Partners).

## Custom headers and API calls [#Partners]

When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your [partner API key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partner-api-reference#the-api-key), [partner ID](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partner-api-reference#partner-id), and your [account ID](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id):

* `X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY`
* `NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID`
* `NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID`

Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key.

This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

## Known limitations

This partner-only authentication method will only work with the [New Relic REST API (v2)](https://api.newrelic.com/). It **does not** work with the following:

* [Deployment API](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/deployment-notifications#api)
* [Infrastructure API for alerts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts)
* [Partner API](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partner-api-reference)
* [Synthetic monitoring API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api)
