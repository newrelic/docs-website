With the [synthetic monitoring REST API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api), you can make API calls to change or retrieve [secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers) data. This document explains the API requirements and contains API curl command examples.

For general guidelines for setting secure credentials and setting them in the UI, see [Secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers).

<Callout variant="important">
  You can now manage your secure credentials with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial#manage-your-secure-credentials).
</Callout>

## Requirements and rules [#requirements]

For general rules about this feature, see the [secure credentials requirements](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers#requirements).

API requirements and rules include:

* See general [synthetic monitoring REST API requirements](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api).
* An account's rate of requests is limited to three requests per second. Requests that exceed this threshold will return a 429 response code.
* A key's value cannot be accessed via the API; an unauthorized user would not have access to the secure key values.

## API examples

    id="add-secure-credential"
    title="Add a secure credential"
  >
    To send a secure credential to your New Relic account, send a POST request to `https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials` with a JSON payload that describes the secure credential. Here's an example:

    ```
    {
      "key": string [required, 1-64 characters uppercase],
      "value": string [required, 1-3,000 characters],
      "description": string [optional]
    }
    ```

    Here's an example of doing this with a curl command:

    ```
    curl -v \
         -X POST -H "Api-Key:<a href='/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api'>$API_KEY</a>" \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials \
         -d  '{ "key": "MYKEY", "value": "my value", "description": "Description of MYKEY" }'
    ```

    A successful request will return a `201 Created` response, with the URI of the newly-created secure credential specified in the `location` header. Possible error codes include:

    * `303 See Other`: The specified key already exists. The returned location header will contain the URI to the key.
    * `400 Bad Request`: Key too long or missing, value too long or missing, non-parsable JSON payload.

    title="Get all secure credentials"
  >
    To view a list of all the secure credentials in your New Relic account, send a GET request to `https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials`. For example:

    ```
    curl -v \
         -H "Api-Key:<a href='/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api'>$API_KEY</a>" https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials
    ```

    A successful request will return a `200 OK` response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format:

    ```
    {
      "secureCredentials": [
        {
          "key": "MYKEY1",
          "description": "Description of MYKEY1",
          "createdAt": "2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000",
          "lastUpdated": "2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000"
        }, {
          "key": "MYKEY2",
          "description": "Description of MYKEY2",
          "createdAt": "2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000",
          "lastUpdated": "2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000"
        }
      ],
      "count": 2
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="get-secure-credential"
    title="Get a specific secure credential"
  >
    To view a single secure credential, send a GET request to `https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/`$KEY.

    ```
    curl -v \
         -H "Api-Key:<a href='/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api'>$API_KEY</a>" https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY
    ```

    A successful request will return a `200 OK` response. The [data returned](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/payload-attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes) will be a JSON object in the following format:

    ```
    {
      "key": string,
      "description": string,
      "createdAt": date,â€‹
      "lastUpdated": date
    }
    ```

    An invalid key will return `404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update-secure-credential"
    title="Update an existing secure credential"
  >
    To update an existing credential in New Relic, send a PUT request to `https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/`$KEY.

    ```
    curl -v \
         -X PUT -H "Api-Key:<a href='/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api'>$API_KEY</a>" \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY \
         -d  '{ "key": "MYKEY", "value": "my value", "description": "Description of MYKEY" }'
    ```

    An invalid key will return `404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-secure-credential"
    title="Delete an existing secure credential"
  >
    To delete an existing credential in New Relic, send a DELETE request to `https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/`$KEY.

    ```
    curl -v \
         -H "Api-Key:<a href='/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api#use-api'>$API_KEY</a>" \
         -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY
    ```

    Please note that if the specified key does not exist, no error will occur.
