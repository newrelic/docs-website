Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the [New Relic Dashboards API](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-api/) with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. To learn how to easily make this transition, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 6:30 minutes).

The Insights Dashboard API reached end of life in 2021.

* As of July 28, 2021, the `CREATE` and `UPDATE` endpoints are not available.
