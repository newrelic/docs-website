You can set alert [thresholds](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-threshold) that trigger when they're violated by any of your Java app's instances. Scoping the condition to instances of your app is helpful for detecting anomalies that occur only in a subset of your app's instances.

These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. By looking at each instance, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating.

## Example

In this example, you set up a policy for a Java app with three instances. You want to open a violation when the condition's critical threshold for any instance's error rate is greater than .02% **for at least** five minutes.

During a five-minute time period the three instances have these error rates:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        **App instance**
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        **4:45pm**
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        **4:50pm**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Violation opened?**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        A
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        No. This instance remained below the target threshold the entire time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        B
      </td>

      <td>
        0.02%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.03%
      </td>

      <td>
        Yes. The alert threshold exceeded the 0.02% threshold for this instance for at least five minutes.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        C
      </td>

      <td>
        0.10%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        No. The threshold value must be breached for [at least five consecutive minutes](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert#threshold-triggers) to open a violation.

        However, if you had set the threshold for **at least once** in five minutes, then the threshold value must be breached [at least once](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/minimum-maximum-values#violation) during the five-minute period.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create instance-based alert condition [#procedure]

To create a policy that triggers notifications for violations by your app's individual instances:

1. Follow the [basic workflow process](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow#alert-policy-process) to set up a policy.
2. When creating a [condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) (step 2), select [**APM**](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition).
3. Select **Application metric** as the type of condition.
4. To calculate alert threshold violations **individually** for each of the app's selected instances, select **Scope to Java application instances**.
5. Select **Next, select entities**, then identify one or more apps for this condition.
6. Optional: Change the time when New Relic Alerts will force-close the violation (default is 24 hours).
7. Use **By condition** or **By condition and signal** [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
8. Continue the rest of the [policy workflow process (step 3)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow#alert-policy-process).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To open violations based on the **average** of all instances for your apps, select **Scope to the application** instead of **Scope to Java application instances**.
</Callout>

## Use "By condition" incident preference [#targets]

When setting the [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) for policies containing instance-based conditions, we recommend that you select **By condition** instead of **By condition and signal**. Although apps are the selected entities for this condition, we evaluate each JVM as a separate entity.

If you set your **Incident preference** to **By condition and signal**, a separate incident will be opened for each JVM that breaches the critical threshold. When an app fails across multiple JVMs, this can lead to alert "fatigue" and frustration.

## Use REST API for instance alerts

To create instance-based [alert conditions with the New Relic REST API](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/rest-api-alerts/manage-entities-alerts-conditions), include these items with your REST API call:

* Your [API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key).
* The numeric [`entity_id`](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#entity) for the [entity](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#entity) being monitored
* The [`condition_id`](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-condition) (available from the API Explorer: [**Alerts Conditions > GET > List**](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/alerts_entity_conditions/list))
* The `entity_type` (set to `"application"`)
* The `condition_scope` (set to `"instance"` for a Java application instance or `"application"` for a Java app)

Here is an example of the API request format and JSON response.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="instance-api"
    title="Instance alert API call"

    Use this format for your API call:

    ```
    curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_entity_conditions/<var>12345</var>.json' \
         -H 'Api-Key:<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key"><var>$API_KEY</var></a>' -i \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -G -d 'entity_type=<var>application</var>&condition_id=<var>234567</var>'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="instance-json"
    title="Instance alert JSON response"

    The API returns the response as JSON.

    ```
    {
      "condition": [
        {
         "id": 234567,
