Let's see how to define the parameters that are going to be part of a condition and get an alert that triggers an incident.

## Create a condition from the guided mode [#guided-mode]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation pane.
2. Click **+New alert condition**.
3. Choose **Use guided mode**, which is the recommended option.

  title="Alerts Conditions main page"
  alt="Alerts Conditions main page"
  src={alertsCreateConditionGuided}
/>

4. Select the part of the system you want to create the alert condition.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Select the entities to watch. There is a maximum of 20.
7. Select a metric to monitor. You can choose **[Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial)** or select a defined metric.
8. Click **Next**.
9. Set thresholds and adjust your signal. 
      * **Configure the [data aggregation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/)**.
      * **Gap filling strategy**. [Gap-filling](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#data-gaps) is a feature that fills blank periods in data reporting with user-defined synthetic value. If you believe the data reporting will be sporadic, you can avoid false alerts by filling in empty aggregation windows with this data. For your first alert, select **None**.
      * **[Evaluation delay](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#evaluation-delay)**. If used, this option enables a period of time for New Relic to wait before evaluating a new signal against your set threshold. It's useful for preventing false positive incidents when a data stream begins to report. For your first alert, you can leave it to the disabled toggle unless you know that this option applies to your data.
      * **Set condition [thresholds](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/)**. 

10. Click **Next**.
11. Name your alert condition. Make sure that you use a clear and meaningful name. Later, you can [modify this name](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/overview/#change-condition).
12. Connect the condition to a policy. You can choose an existing policy or [create a new one](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/).
12. You can add a runbook URL so that personnel handling the incident that triggered the alert will know what to do.
13. Click **Save condition**.


## Create a condition writing your own query [#own-query]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation pane.
2. Click **+New alert condition**.
3. Choose **Write your own query**.

<img

  alt="Alerts Conditions main page"
  src={alertsCreateConditionOwnQuery}
/>

4. Write your query and click **Run** to see the chart. See [How to use NRQL: the mechanics of querying](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/) if you need help for adding a query. 
5. Click **Next**.
6. Set thresholds and adjust your signal. 
      * **Configure the [data aggregation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/)**.
      * **Gap filling strategy**. [Gap-filling](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#data-gaps) is a feature that fills blank periods in data reporting with user-defined synthetic value. If you believe the data reporting will be sporadic, you can avoid false alerts by filling in empty aggregation windows with this data. For your first alert, select **None**.
      * **[Evaluation delay](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#evaluation-delay)**.

It's useful for preventing false positive incidents when a data stream begins to report. For your first alert, you can leave it to the disabled toggle unless you know that this option applies to your data.
      * **Set condition [thresholds](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/)**. 

7. Click **Next**.
8. Name your alert condition. Make sure that you use a clear and meaningful name. Later, you can [modify this name](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/overview/#change-condition).
9. Connect the condition to a policy. You can choose an existing policy or [create a new one](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/).
10. You can add a runbook URL so that personnel handling the incident that triggered the alert will know what to do.
11. Click **Save condition**.

See [NRQL and alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/nrql-alert-conditions) if you want to know more about it.

## Create a condition from a chart [#from-chart]

Most of our charts, with the exception of a few older ones, allow you to create a condition from them. When you create a condition from a chart, the query mode opens.

To create an alert condition from a chart, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Create alert condition**.

<img
  width="70%;"
  title="Create a condition from a chart"
  alt="Create a condition from a chart"
  src={alertsCreateConditionFromChart}
/>

If the chart includes multiple queries, you'll have the option of selecting one of them to create an alert on your selected query.

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Create a condition from a chart, selecting a query"
  alt="Create a condition from a chart, selecting a query"
  src={alertsFromChartSelectQuery}
/>

<Callout variant="important">
  Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, `0.01` is the smallest possible value.
