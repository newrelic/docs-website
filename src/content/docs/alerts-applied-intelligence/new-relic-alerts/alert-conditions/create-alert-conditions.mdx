## Create a condition [#create-condition]

To create a condition:

1. [Create a policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-or-rename-alert-policy#alert-policy-name) and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition.

   OR

   From an existing [policy page](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-or-rename-alert-policy#alert-policy-view), select **Create/add a condition.**
2. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include:
   * Selecting a product/data-source
   * Selecting a [condition type](#condition-types)
   * Defining [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert)
3. Optional: After you finish creating a condition, [copy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions) it and add it to other policies.

<Callout variant="important">
  Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, `0.01` is the smallest possible value.
</Callout>

## Types of conditions [#condition-types]

Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="nrql-conditions"
    title="NRQL query conditions"
  >
    Use the UI or [NerdGraph API](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-nrql-conditions) to create NRQL conditions for [basic NRQL queries that return a number](/docs/new-relic-alerts-alert-nrql-queries).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm-conditions"
    title="APM metric alert conditions"
  >
    See [APM metric alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/apm-metric-alert-conditions) for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="anomaly-conditions"
    title="Anomaly conditions"
  >
    [Anomaly alerting](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-anomaly-alert-conditions) allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-apm) and [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) apps, as well as [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="synthetics-multi-location"
    title="Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions"
  >
    With [multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/multi-location-synthetics-alert-conditions), you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-transactions"
    title="Key transaction metrics conditions"
  >
    For APM, you can set up conditions for [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/introduction-key-transactions).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="instance-violations"
    title="Java instance conditions"
  >
    You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics.

    By [scoping thresholds to specific instances](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/scope-alert-thresholds-specific-instances), you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="jvm-metrics"
    title="JVM health metric conditions (Java apps)"
  >
    For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set [thresholds](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-threshold) that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range.

    We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's [selected instances](#instance-violations). When creating your condition, select **JVM health metric** as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds:

    * Deadlocked threads
    * Heap memory usage
    * CPU utilization time
    * Garbage collection CPU time

      Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a [violation](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-violation) force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="app-response-percentiles"
    title="Web transaction percentile conditions"
  >
    We include the option to define a percentile as the [threshold](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-threshold) for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's **overall** [web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) response time rather than the **average** web response time.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a [non-web app transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction), use the [NRQL queries](#nrql-conditions) feature.
    </Callout>

    To define the percentile threshold:

    1. Select **Web transactions percentiles** as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual **Web transactions percentiles** condition for each.)
    2. To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the **Percentile nth** response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value).

       We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dynamic-targeting-labels"
    title="Dynamic targeting with labels for apps"
  >
    By applying [labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/organize-your-data/labels-categories-organize-apps-servers-monitors#labels) to applications, you can automatically link these [entities](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-entity) to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the [agent configuration file](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/organize-your-data/labels-categories-organize-apps-servers-monitors#config) to best maintain entity labels.

    A single label identifies **all** entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels.

    Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a [violation close timer](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/how-alert-condition-violations-are-closed#time-limit).

    To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition:

    1. Select **APM > Application metric** as the product type.
    2. When identifying entities, select the **Labels** tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories.

       You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="infrastructure"
    title="Infrastructure conditions"
  >
    You can [create conditions for your resources](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) directly in Infrastructure.

    For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the [host not reporting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition) condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Apdex and response time conditions [#alert_response]

You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, [Apdex scores](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score) are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience.

## Change a condition name [#rename-condition]

If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc.

* Use camel case or dotted decimal notation.
* Describe the essence of what is being violated.

To change an existing condition's name:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (policies) > (select a policy)**.
2. Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition.

You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type.

## Maintain policies and conditions [#condition-setup]

After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can:

* Repeat the steps to [add more conditions](#create-condition) to the policy.
* Continue the policy setup process by [adding one or more notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) to it.
* Change the [condition's name](#rename-condition), the [entities](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition) it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert).
* [Copy the condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions) and add it other policies in the selected account.
* [Rename the policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/name-or-rename-alert-policy).
* [Disable](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions) any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions.

You may also manage your policies via [the policies NerdGraph API](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-policies).

## View existing conditions [#alert-condition-view]

The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (policies)**.
2. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions.

To view [policy and condition information for a specific entity](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/view-policy-conditions-new-relic-products): From that entity's product UI, select **Settings**, then click **Alert conditions**.
