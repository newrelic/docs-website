Alert [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) include the option to identify the URL for your [runbook](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-runbook) instructions. This allows you to link to information or standard procedures for handling an incident opened when a situation breaches the condition's [critical threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert).

In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, **(select a policy)**, then **(select a condition)**: You can add a runbook URL so that personnel handling the incident that triggered the alert will know what to do.

To edit the runbook URL associated with a condition:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, **(select a policy)**, then **(select a condition)**.
2. On the **Edit conditions** page, click **Add runbook URL**, then provide the full path for your runbook URL (runbook URL, URL to internal wiki page, etc.), and then save.
3. Optional: To change or delete an existing runbook URL from the alert condition, click **Remove**.

We'll include your runbook URL in **Incident** details and in email notifications so that personnel will know exactly what to do.
