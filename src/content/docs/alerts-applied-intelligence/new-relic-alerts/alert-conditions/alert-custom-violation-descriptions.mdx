For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL.

## Requirements

The custom violation description feature is available for:

* NRQL alert conditions
* Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions

The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000.

## What is a custom violation description? [#description]

For some [types of conditions](#requirements), you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can:

* Capture the reason for the condition
* Define the signal being monitored
* Define next steps
* Add metadata to downstream systems

The **Custom violation description** field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, [substitutes the generic sections with specific values](#substitution-format). For example, let's say you used this in a description:

```
This is my condition name : {{conditionName}}
The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}}
```

A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this:

```
This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition
The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal
```

## Create a custom violation description [#create-description]

  In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, **(select a policy)**, then **(select a condition)**: Click **+ Add custom violation description** to open the field.

For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field.

## Custom violation description template example [#example]

Here's a custom violation description template example:

```
this is my condition name : {{conditionName}}
The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}}
Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}}
Product: {{tag.label.product}}
ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}}
Service name : {{tag.label.Name}}
AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}
AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}}
Department : {{tag.label.department}}
Environment: {{tag.label.environment}}
Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}}
Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}}
EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}}
EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}}
EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}}
EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}}
```

Here's how that data might appear in a notification:

## How to use attributes [#attributes-tags]

The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the [violation event](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes). Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them:

* Violation event attributes: For any of the [standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes), use the format `{{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}`. For example:

  ```
  The target name is : {{targetName}}
  ```
* Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format `{{tag.TAG_NAME}}`. There are two types of tags:
  * Entity-related tags: **For Infrastructure conditions only.** You can find available [entity-related tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor#) by going to the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) and looking under a service's **Metadata and tags**, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description:

    ```
    The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}
    Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}}
    ```
  * Facet clause tags: **For NRQL conditions only.** If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use `tag` formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included `FACET hostName, cluster`, you could then use this:

    ```
    The host is : {{tag.hostName}}
    The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}}
    ```

Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves.

## Create a custom violation description with NRQL [#create-description-nrql]

You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description.

Here's an empty mutation template:

```
mutation {
     alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, id: "<var>YOUR_CONDITION_ID</var>", condition: {description: ""}) {
       <var>YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION</var>
     }
    }
```

Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description:

```
mutation {
     alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: "123456", condition: {description: "timestamp : {{timestamp}} \n accountId : {{accountId}} \n type : {{type}} \n event : {{event}} \n description : {{description}} \n policyId : {{policyId}} \n policyName: {{policyName}} \n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \n product : {{product}} \n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \n targetID : {{targetId}} \n targetName : {{targetName}} \n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}"}) {
       description
     }
    }
```

* For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to [NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-nrql-conditions).
* For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when [creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
* To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the [example template](#example) and the [attribute/tag instructions](#attributes-tags).

## Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack [#mention-in-slack]

When creating a description that you know will be sent to [Slack](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts#slack), you may wish to **@mention** a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. **@here** or **@channel**). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by `<` and `>` characters.

Here's an example for mentioning a user:

```
Attention <@LewCirne>
```

Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification:

```
Attention <!channel>
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a **!** prefix instead of **@**

  e.g. **!here** or **!channel**
</Callout>
