To alert on custom metrics, follow standard procedures to [add a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) to a policy. The condition's [Thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) section includes the option to select **Custom > Search metric name**, where you define your specific metric values. You can start typing the custom metric name or select from the list that automatically appears.

## Requirements for custom metrics [#custom-metrics-requirements]

Use the policy's **Thresholds** section to define the custom metric values. These include:

* The exact custom metric name for the selected product category and [targets](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition). Note: wildcard characters are not allowed.
* Selected threshold value function. The options are average, minimum, maximum, count, and rate.
* Selected threshold level. The options are above, below, and equal to.
* Critical (required) and Warning (optional) threshold value and duration that will open a violation. For example, `5 units for at least 5 minutes`.
* Condition name (required) for the custom metric.

## Create a custom metric condition [#custom-metrics-threshold]

To define the custom metric values for your condition:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, then **(select a policy)** or [add a new alert policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/name-or-rename-alert-policy).
2. From the policy's **Alert conditions** page, click **Add a condition**.
3. From the **Categorize** section, select the [product and type of condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) for the custom metric.
4. From the **Select entities** section, add one or more [targets (entities)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition) that use your custom metric.
5. From the **Define thresholds > When target application** section, select **Custom > Search metric name**, and begin typing the custom metric name, select from the list, or type the exact metric name.
6. Provide the [required threshold values](#custom-metrics-requirements) for your custom metric.
7. From the **Define thresholds > Condition name** section, provide a [meaningful name](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions#best-practices-conditions) for your custom metric condition, maximum 100 characters.
8. Optional: Include the [URL with runbook instructions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/provide-runbook-instructions-alerts) for handling the situation.
9. Click **Create condition**.

Repeat these steps as necessary to create additional conditions for custom metrics.

## View or update custom metric conditions [#viewing-updating-custom]

After you save the condition, you can view the selected policy's **Alert conditions** page with a list of each condition. From here you can follow standard procedures to select and update the [custom metric condition](#custom-metrics-threshold).

The **Condition name** does not appear in the **Thresholds** section for a saved condition. If you want to [change the condition name](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions#rename-condition) for a custom metric, edit it from the selected policy's **Alert conditions** page:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, then **(select a policy)**.
2. Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition.
