When you create a condition, you set personalized **thresholds** that determine what will open an incident. This document explains what thresholds are and how to set them.

## What is a threshold? [#threshold-definition]

For a [condition](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-condition), thresholds are the settings that determine what opens an [incident](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-violation). Depending on a policy's [issue creation preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents), and any [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) you may have configured, an incident may result in:

* The creation of an issue.
* Notifications being sent.

### There are two types of thresholds: [#threshold-types]

* **Static** - one value set by you.
* **Anomaly** - An [Anomaly](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/other-condition-types/create-anomaly-alert-conditions/#set-anomaly-thresholds) threshold uses past data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. This will adjust over time as it learns the patterns of your data. 


### Examples of thresholds: [#threshold-examples]

* An application's average web response time is greater than 5 seconds for 15 minutes.
* An application's error rate per minute hits 10% or higher at least once in an hour.
* An application's AJAX response time deviates a certain amount from its expected behavior.

Besides a critical threshold level, you can also set thresholds for a less serious [warning level](#threshold-levels).

## View and set thresholds [#viewing-thresholds]

Thresholds are set during the process of [creating a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "220px" }}>
        Goal
      </th>

      <th>
        Instructions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Set thresholds for a new condition
      </td>

      <td>
        Set thresholds as part of the process of [creating a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#create-condition).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View and update thresholds for existing conditions
      </td>

      <td>
        To view a condition’s thresholds: [find that condition in the UI](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#alert-condition-view). To update thresholds, select a condition’s thresholds and make changes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To learn more about specific alert condition types (like anomaly and NRQL), see [Types of conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#condition-types).

    You can list and edit conditions with [the alerts API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="threshold-levels"
    title="Set thresholds"

    You can set thresholds for two levels: critical and warning. At least one threshold must be set.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Threshold level
          </th>

          <th>
            Details
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img title="Alerts v3: Critical alert icon" alt="icon-alert-critical.png" src={accountsAlertsCritical}/> Critical (red)
          </td>

          <td>
            Optional. When an incident occurs, it may send notifications depending on the policy's [issue creation preference setting](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) and any [workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) you may have configured.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <img title="Alerts v3: Warning alert icon" alt="icon-alert-warning.png" src={accountsAlertWarning}/> Warning (yellow)
          </td>

          <td>
            Optional. Will open warning-level incident and may send notifications depending on the policy's [issue creation preference setting](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) and any [workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) you may have configured. Use a warning threshold if you want to monitor when a system behavior is concerning or noteworthy but not important enough to require a critical-level threshold.

  <Collapser
    id="signal-loss"
    title="Loss of signal (NRQL only)"
  >
    A [loss of signal](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#signal-loss) is a period of time when no data is received by New Relic. This could be the result of an entity or service going offline, a problem with an agent or collector, or networking problems in a data center or the internet. You can use loss of signal detection to create a new incident if a signal stops and you expect a service to be stable. You may also want to use this to determine when an ephemeral service stops and set the action to close any open incidents that exist for this condition.
    
    You may also need to configure loss of signal if you're using `count(*)` or `uniqueCount(*)` in your query. See [NRQL conditions and query order of operations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#query-order) for more details.

  <Collapser
    id="time-intervals"
    title="Set time intervals"
  >
    Different condition types have different minimum time intervals. For example, some condition types have a minimum time interval of 5 minutes (for example, <InlinePopover type="apm" /> metric alert conditions), and others have a minimum time interval of 1 minute (for example, NRQL alert conditions). The same happens with the maximum time interval, where the amount is 120 minutes.
