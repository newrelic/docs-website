You can view [events](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology) and other activity for a specific entity from the New Relic product index. For example, to find more information about a specific app in APM: Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM**</DoNotTranslate>, then mouse over the listed apps, or select an event from the <DoNotTranslate>**Applications activity**</DoNotTranslate> list.

For instructions on how to view these details in Infrastructure, see the [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#view-alerts) documentation.
