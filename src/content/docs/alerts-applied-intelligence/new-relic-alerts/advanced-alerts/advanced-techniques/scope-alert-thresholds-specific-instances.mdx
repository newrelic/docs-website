You can set alert [thresholds](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-threshold) that trigger when they're breached by any of your Java app's instances. Scoping the condition to instances of your app is helpful for detecting anomalies that occur only in a subset of your app's instances.

These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. By looking at each instance, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating.

## Example [#example]

In this example, you set up a policy for a Java app with three instances. You want to open an incident when the condition's critical threshold for any instance's error rate is greater than .02% <DoNotTranslate>**for at least**</DoNotTranslate> five minutes.

During a five-minute time period the three instances have these error rates:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        <DoNotTranslate>**App instance**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        <DoNotTranslate>**4:45pm**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>
        <DoNotTranslate>**4:50pm**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DoNotTranslate>**Incident opened?**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        A
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        No. This instance remained below the target threshold the entire time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        B
      </td>

      <td>
        0.02%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.03%
      </td>

      <td>
        Yes. The alert threshold exceeded the 0.02% threshold for this instance for at least five minutes.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        C
      </td>

      <td>
        0.10%
      </td>

      <td>
        0.00%
      </td>

      <td>
        No. The threshold value must be breached for [at least five consecutive minutes](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert#threshold-triggers) to open an incident.

        However, if you had set the threshold for <DoNotTranslate>**at least once**</DoNotTranslate> in five minutes, then the threshold value must be breached [at least once](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/minimum-maximum-values#violation) during the five-minute period.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create instance-based alert condition [#procedure]

<img
    title="Create alerts based on threshold instances"
    alt="A screenshot showing what to select to create alerts based on threshold instances"
    src={alertsThresholdsInstances}
/>

To create a policy that triggers notifications for incidents by your app's individual instances:

1. Follow the [basic workflow process](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow#alert-policy-process) to set up a policy.
2. When creating a [condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) (step 2), select [<DoNotTranslate>**APM**</DoNotTranslate>](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition).
3. Select <DoNotTranslate>**Application metric**</DoNotTranslate> as the type of condition.
4. To evaluate alert threshold incidents <DoNotTranslate>**individually**</DoNotTranslate> for each of the app's selected instances, select <DoNotTranslate>**Scope to Java application instances**</DoNotTranslate>.
5. Select <DoNotTranslate>**Next, select entities**</DoNotTranslate>, then identify one or more apps for this condition.
6. Optional: Change the time when <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> will force-close the incidents (default is 24 hours).
7. Use <DoNotTranslate>**By condition**</DoNotTranslate> or <DoNotTranslate>**By condition and signal**</DoNotTranslate> [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
8. Continue the rest of the [policy workflow process (step 3)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow#alert-policy-process).


<Callout variant="tip">
  To open incidents based on the <DoNotTranslate>**average**</DoNotTranslate> of all instances for your apps, select <DoNotTranslate>**Scope to the application**</DoNotTranslate> instead of <DoNotTranslate>**Scope to Java application instances**</DoNotTranslate>.
</Callout>

## Use "By condition" incident preference [#targets]

When setting the [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) for policies containing instance-based conditions, we recommend that you select <DoNotTranslate>**By condition**</DoNotTranslate> instead of <DoNotTranslate>**By condition and signal**</DoNotTranslate>. Although apps are the selected entities for this condition, we evaluate each JVM as a separate entity.

If you set your <DoNotTranslate>**Incident preference**</DoNotTranslate> to <DoNotTranslate>**By condition and signal**</DoNotTranslate>, a separate incident will be opened for each JVM that breaches the critical threshold. When an app fails across multiple JVMs, this can lead to alert "fatigue" and frustration.

## Use REST API for instance alerts

To create instance-based [alert conditions with the New Relic REST API](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/rest-api-alerts/manage-entities-alerts-conditions), include these items with your REST API call:

* Your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key).
* The numeric [`entity_id`](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#entity) for the [entity](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#entity) being monitored
* The [`condition_id`](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-condition) (available from the API Explorer: [<DoNotTranslate>**Alerts Conditions > GET > List**</DoNotTranslate>](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/alerts_entity_conditions/list))
* The `entity_type` (set to `"application"`)
* The `condition_scope` (set to `"instance"` for a Java application instance or `"application"` for a Java app)

Here is an example of the API request format and JSON response.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="instance-api"
    title="Instance alert API call"
  >
    Use this format for your API call:

    ```sh
    curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_entity_conditions/12345.json' \
         -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -G -d 'entity_type=application&condition_id=234567'
    ```

    * Replace `$API_KEY` with your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key).
