You can use targeted entities to monitor the types of data that matter most to your business.

A targeted entity is a specific [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) you can create, view, and update. Learn more about these three options below.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Before you get started, make sure you create an [alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) first.
</Callout>

## Add entities to a condition [#adding-targets]

For your convenience, the user interface organizes targeted entities into logical folders. You can use these folders to edit entities anytime. If applicable, the target folders reflect what your organization has defined for [labels and rollup categories](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).

<Callout variant="important">
  With the exception of [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information), there's a [limit](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/minimum-maximum-values) to the number of entities you may add to a condition.
