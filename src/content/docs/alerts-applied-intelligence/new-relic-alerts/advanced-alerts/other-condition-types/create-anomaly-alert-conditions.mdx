You can use anomaly conditions to define violation [thresholds](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-threshold) that adjust to the behavior of your data.

Anomaly alerting is useful for creating [conditions](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-condition) that:

* Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally.
* Dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, including daily or weekly trends.

In addition, anomaly alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors.

## How it works [#anomaly-overview]

When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for an anomaly  condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior.

The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called an **anomaly.** It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the anomaly condition UI.

You'll use the anomaly alert condition UI to:

* Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source.
* Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: "deviating for more than five minutes").
* Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.

When your data escapes the predicted "normal" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification.

To create an anomaly condition, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition**: When you start to create a [condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#create-condition), choose one of the following [data sources](#availability):

* NRQL: Create a NRQL condition and then choose anomaly
* APM: Application metric anomaly
* Browser: Metric anomaly

Here are some tips for setting anomaly thresholds:

* Set the [anomaly direction](#upper-lower) to monitor violations that happen either above or below the anomaly.
* Set the preview chart to either [2 days or 7 days](#days) of displayed data. (Not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).)
* Use the slider bar to adjust the <img title="Alerts v3: Critical alert icon" alt="icon-alert-critical.png" src={iconAlertCritical}/> **Critical** threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the anomaly. The tighter the band around the anomaly, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate.
* Optional: You can create a <img title="Alerts v3: Warning alert icon" alt="icon-alert-warning.png" src={iconAlertWarning}/> [**Warning** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/set-thresholds-alert-condition#threshold-levels) (the darker gray area around the anomaly).
* For NRQL alerts, see the [allowed types of NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries#threshold-types).
* If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.)

## Faceted anomaly conditions [#anomaly-facets]

<img

<figcaption>
  NRQL alerts conditions support faceted anomaly. In the chart legend, click a time series to scope it to a single facet.
</figcaption>

Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a anomaly condition, you can scope your results to a single anomaly.

<img

The single time series shows the anomaly, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any.

## Anomaly rules and settings [#anomaly-algorithm]

Here are some details about how the UI works:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="anomaly-rules"
    title="Rules governing creation of anomalies"
  >
    The algorithm for anomaly conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Data trait
          </th>

          <th>
            Anomaly rules
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Age of data
          </td>

          <td>
            On initial creation, the anomaly is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and anomaly type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data.

            For data that has only existed for a short time, the anomaly will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the anomaly and thresholds will become.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Consistency of data
          </td>

          <td>
            For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the anomaly. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Regular fluctuations
          </td>

          <td>
            For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the anomaly algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="upper-lower"
    title="anomaly direction: select upper or lower ranges"
  >
    You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the anomaly ("upper") or that goes below the anomaly ("lower"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the **Anomaly direction** selector.

    Example use cases for this:

    * You might use the **Upper** setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down.
    * You might use the **Lower** setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem.

      Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different anomaly direction settings. The red areas represent violations.

  >
    Not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries). When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying **Since 2 days ago** or **Since 7 days ago**. These selections are **not** the time period used to compute anomaly; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the anomaly, see the [algorithm rules](#anomaly-rules).
