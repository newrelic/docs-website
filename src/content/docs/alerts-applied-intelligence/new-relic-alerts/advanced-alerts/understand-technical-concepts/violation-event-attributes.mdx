The violation of a condition generates a violation event, which passes important information downstream.

For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see [Alerts concepts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology).

## What is a violation event? [#definition]

The violation of a [condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology) generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features.

<Callout variant="important">
  The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event.
</Callout>

## Violation event attributes [#attributes]

This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in [NrAiIncident](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAiIncident).

<Callout title="BETA FEATURE">
`NrAiIncident` is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out!
</Callout>

You may be wondering why we're using `NrAiIncident` as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as "violations," they'll be called "incidents" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions.

All attributes are available for use in a [description](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/alert-condition-descriptions). Read about attributes available for [muting rules](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/muting-rules-suppress-notifications).
