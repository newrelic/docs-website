Alert [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) include the option to identify the URL for your [runbook](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-runbook) instructions. This allows you to link to information or standard procedures for handling an incident opened when a situation breaches the condition's [critical threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert).

To edit the runbook URL associated with a condition:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (policies) > (select a policy) > (select a condition)**.
2. On the **Edit conditions** page, click **Add details**, and then scroll down to **Runbook URL**. Provide the full path for your runbook URL (runbook URL, URL to internal wiki page, etc.).
3. Toggle **Enable on save** and click **Save**. 
3. Optional: To change or delete an existing runbook URL from the alert condition, click **Remove**.

We'll include your runbook URL in **Incident** details and in email notifications so that personnel will know exactly what to do.
