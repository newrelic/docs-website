With alerts you can easily tell whether an entity (the target for the notification) has one or more conditions associated with it:

* If **yes**, its health status indicator on the selected index (APM, browser, etc.) will be color-coded to the current state. To view a summary of current alert incidents, mouse over its health status indicator.
* If **no**, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey.

<Callout variant="important">
  To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see [alerting concepts and terms](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/basic-alerting-concepts/).
</Callout>

## Exceptions

The health status indicator doesn't apply for:

* Infrastructure entities
* [Dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards)
* Entities targeted by labels

## Color-coded health status [#colors]

Entities in New Relic are automatically color-coded with their health status. For example, to view the health of your <InlinePopover type="apm" /> apps, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **APM**. The **Applications** index lists all <InlinePopover type="apm" /> product entities and their current health status.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={250}>
        **Color**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Health status**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src={accountsAlertsGreen}/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert incidents are currently reported for it.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-yellow.png" src={accountsAlertsYellow}/> Yellow
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is degraded. A [warning threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src={accountsAlertsRed}/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        A [critical threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated:

        * [Notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) have been sent based on the selected [incident rollup preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
        * The incident appears in the [**Incidents** index](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src={accountsAlertsGray}/> Gray
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Health status transitions [#health-status-tranistions]

The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **From...**
      </th>

      <th width={150}>
        **To...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Transition explanation**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src={accountsAlertsGray}/> Gray
      </td>

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src={accountsAlertsGreen}/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no incidents present.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src={accountsAlertsGreen}/> Green /

        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src={accountsAlertsRed}/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src={accountsAlertsGray}/> Gray
      </td>

      <td>
        Possible explanations:

        * The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report.
        * The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report.
        * The entity has stopped reporting data.
        * There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the [New Relic status page](https://status.newrelic.com/) for updates.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src={accountsAlertsGreen}/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-yellow.png" src={accountsAlertsYellow}/> Yellow /

        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src={accountsAlertsRed}/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        There's at least one open incident at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-yellow.png" src={accountsAlertsYellow}/> Yellow /

        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src={accountsAlertsRed}/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src={accountsAlertsGreen}/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        The last open incident associated to the entity has been closed.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Example: App without conditions [#example-v3-no-policies]

Here's an example of an app listed on the <InlinePopover type="apm" /> index that **is not** associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity.

<img
  title="032715crop-events-no-v3.png"
  alt="032715crop-events-no-v3.png"
  src={accountsEventAlerts}
/>

<figcaption>
  Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Explorer**: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions.
</figcaption>

Follow [standard procedures](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions) to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it.

## Example: App with conditions [#example-v3-yes-policies]

Here's an example of an app listed on the <InlinePopover type="apm" /> index that **is** associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) incidents.

<img
  title="032715crop-events-green.png"
  alt="032715crop-events-green.png"
  src={accountsCropAlertEventsGreen}
/>

<figcaption>
  Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Explorer**: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.
