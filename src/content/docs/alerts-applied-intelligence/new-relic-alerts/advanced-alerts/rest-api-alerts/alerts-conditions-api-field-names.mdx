The [REST API endpoints](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts) allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition.

## Required and optional fields [#required]

The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions:

* APM
* External services
* Synthetic monitoring
* Plugins

All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields:

* `enabled` (defaults to `false`)
* `runbook_url`
* `user_defined`

## Field definitions [#field-names]

Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="aggregation_window"
    title="aggregation_window"
  >
    Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable.

    The default is `1` minute. The maximum is 15 minutes.

    Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points.

    In the UI, under **Advanced signal settings**, this is the **Aggregation window** field.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="close_violations_on_expiration"
    title="close_violations_on_expiration"
  >
    When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the `expiration_duration` time.

    The default is `False`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="condition-scope"
    title="condition_scope"
  >
    This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings:

    * instance
    * application

    Used for:

    * Conditions
    * Entity conditions

    For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also [`violation_close_timer`](#violation_close_timer).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="enabled"
    title="enabled"
  >
    This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is `false`.

    This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods.

    Used for:

    * Conditions
    * External service conditions
    * Synthetic monitoring conditions
    * Plugin conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="entities"
    title="entities"
  >
    This is an array of [entity](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-entity) IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc.

    These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one.

    Used for:

    * Conditions
    * External service conditions
    * Plugin conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="evaluation_offset"
    title="evaluation_offset"
  >
    The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is `3` minutes.

    In the UI, under **Advanced signal settings**, this is the **Offset evaluation by** field.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="expected_groups"
    title="expected_groups"
  >
    This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the [`ignore_overlap`](#ignore_overlap) option.

    Used for:

    * NRQL outlier conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="expiration_duration"
    title="expiration_duration"
  >
    How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="external_service_url"
    title="external_service_url"
  >
    This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must **not** include the protocol. For example, use `example.com`, not `https://example.com`.

    Used for:

    * External service conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="fill_option"
    title="fill_option"
  >
    For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. 

    * `none`: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation.
    * `static`: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of `fillValue` that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0.
    * `last_value`: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours.

    In the UI, under **Advanced signal settings**, this is the **Fill data gaps with** field.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="fill_value"
    title="fill_value"
  >
    This is the value used by the `fill_option` custom value. The default is `0`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ignore_overlap"
    title="ignore_overlap"
  >
    If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching.

    Used for:

    * NRQL outlier conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metric"
    title="metric"
  >
    The **metric** field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the [type](#type) field. These are listed below according to their alert [type](#type) field.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="alerts_plugin_conditions"
        title="Alerts plugin conditions"
      >
        For Plugin conditions this is the **metric**, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="alerts_conditions"
        title="Alerts conditions"

    This determines what comparison will be used between the **value_function** and the **terms\[threshold]** value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when [adding a threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert#adding-thresholds) in the UI. It must be one of the following strings:

    * above
    * below
    * equal

    This is the name of a user defined custom **metric** to be used to determine if an event should be triggered.

    The **user_defined\[value_function]** associated with the metric is compared with the **terms\[threshold]** value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by **terms\[operator]**.

    Used for:

    * Conditions
    * External service conditions
    * Synthetic monitoring conditions
    * Plugin conditions
  </Collapser>

    This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by **user_defined\[metric]**.

    It is compared with the **terms\[threshold]** value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by **terms\[operator]**.

    One of these value functions must be specified:

    * average
    * min
    * max
    * total
    * sample_size

    Used for:

    * Conditions
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="value_function"
    title="value_function"

    This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings:

    * min
    * max
    * average
    * sample_size
    * total
    * percent

    Used for:

    * Plugin conditions

    When used for a [NRQL condition](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts#nrql-condition), the options are:

    * single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value)
    * sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration)
  </Collapser>
