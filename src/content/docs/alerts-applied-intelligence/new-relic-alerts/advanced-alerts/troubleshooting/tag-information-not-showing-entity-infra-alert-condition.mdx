## Problem

[Custom violation description tags](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/alert-custom-violation-descriptions#example) are not being replaced by the values from the event.

## Solution

Tags are only available for events that are indexed by New Relic.

The easiest way to know whether an event is indexed is to run the query `SELECT nr.entityType FROM ${EventSampleName}`, replacing `${EventSampleName}` with the name of the event in question.

If there are values in the column `nr.entity Type` of the result, then the event is indexed. Otherwise it is not.

## Cause

It is not possible to add a description to any sample that does not get indexed in New Relic.
