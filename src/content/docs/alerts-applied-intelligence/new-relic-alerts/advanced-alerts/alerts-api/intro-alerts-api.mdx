We have two options for using APIs for programmatically managing New Relic's alerting and applied intelligence features: 

* NerdGraph (GraphQL): this is New Relic's primary and recommended API for querying data and making configurations. We're always adding functionality to NerdGraph. [See the alerting-related NerdGraph docs.](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-api-examples)
* REST API: this is New Relic's original API. We do minimal work on this API and that's why we recommend using NerdGraph. If you're currently using the REST API, we recommend switching to NerdGraph. [See the alerting-related REST API docs.](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/rest-api-alerts/rest-api-calls-alerts)
