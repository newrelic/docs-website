You can manage your policies, conditions, and muting rules programmatically using our GraphQL-format [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). This is a powerful alternative to managing them within New Relic or with our older [REST API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts).

## Alerts features you can manage with NerdGraph [#what-you-can-do]

Here are links to the alerts-related NerdGraph docs: 

* [Manage policies](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-policies)
* [Use NRQL conditions](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-nrql-conditions)
* [Add muting rules to suppress notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/muting-rules-suppress-notifications)
* [Manage notification channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-api-notification-channels)
* [Customize loss of signal and gap filling](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-api-loss-signal-gap-filling)

The easiest way to discover alerts queries and mutations is through the NerdGraph API explorer.
