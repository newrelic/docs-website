When violations of the [threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) set in a [condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) occur, depending on the policy's **[Incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents)** settings, Alerts may create an incident. You can review information about incidents in several ways:

* [View the incidents index](#view-violations) so you can scan for patterns in a list of incidents.
* [View the violations](#view-log) included in a specific incident to examine associated performance details.
* [View the events](#violation-time) included in a specific incident to review the timestamps for [events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#event), such as a violation opening or closing, notifications, and acknowledgments.

  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI > Incidents > (select an incident)**: Notice that the condition's threshold was violated around 2pm (the blue line went over the red dotted line), but the alert wasn't triggered until the violation occurred for more than five minutes, as specified in the condition.

## View the incidents index and violation details [#view-violations]

Violations are grouped together into incidents. If you want to change how violations are grouped, open the associated policy and change the [**Incident preference**](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) setting.

To view violation details:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Incidents**, then click **Open incidents** or **All incidents**.
2. Select an incident row.
3. Click **Violations** to view a list of the violations included in this incident.
4. Select one of the violations to see a chart and details for it.

Details for individual violation charts include:

* **Timing information**: The shaded red area on the chart shows you the time period when the violation occurred, where the preceding shaded pink area represents the [degradation period](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#degradation-period). If you select a violation that lasted longer than two hours, the timeline on the bottom of the chart will be jagged. To provide context for events in the incident, the chart also shows the time frame surrounding the violation.
* **Chart guidelines**: The red dotted line marks the threshold for the condition. The blue line depicts performance information.
* **Anomalous behavior:** If Alerts detects [anomalous behavior](#anomalous-behavior) near the time of the violation, you'll see a notification in the violation details.

From this page, you can take action regarding the incident:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={250}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>

      </td>

      <td>
        [Acknowledge the incident](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/acknowledge-alert-incidents) by selecting the acknowledge ![040815-icon-ack.png](./images/040815-icon-ack.png "Alerts v3: alert icons") icon or button.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          Anyone in the account who can view the violation can also close it.

## View the events in an incident [#view-log]

If you want to view alerting [events across all products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/review-events-across-products), go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, then click **Explorer**. To view the events for just one incident:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, then click **Explorer.**
2. Select an entity row.
3. In the left nav under **Events**, click **Violations**.
4. Select one of the events to view a chart and details for it.

## Time between violation and notification [#violation-time]

There may be a difference of up to three minutes between the violation event time and the initial notification time due to variances in data processing time.

* **Notification time:** The time in the notification reflects the timestamp of when we received the request to deliver a notification.
* **Violation time:** The time you see on the **Events** page for the violation reflects the timestamp of data collection for the last data point that contributed to opening the violation.

## Anomalous behavior detection [#anomalous-behavior]

When we detect large changes in key signals in the alerting entity and/or upstream/downstream applications of the alerting entity, an "anomalous behavior detected" notification appears on the violation's page and in notification channels. You can:

* Expand the notification for details about the detected anomaly (web only).
* See upstream/downstream anomalies (Slack only).
* Select a link to go to the relevant product chart for further investigation.
