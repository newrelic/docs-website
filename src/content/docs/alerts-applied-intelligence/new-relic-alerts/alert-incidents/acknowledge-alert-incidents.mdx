![Alerts v3: Alert incidents acknowledge](./images/040815incidents-ack.png "Alerts v3: Alert incidents acknowledge")

When you acknowledge an [incident](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology), this indicates you're taking ownership of it. This is useful to let others who've received the notification know that you've taken responsibility for it.

## What "acknowledge" means [#ack-role]

Follow your organization's guidelines for what responsibilities you are agreeing to own when you acknowledge an incident. By acknowledging the incident, this simply flags your name and notifies others.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To provide a quick reference to your organization's standard operating procedures for handling an alert, you can include a [runbook URL in the condition thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/provide-runbook-instructions-alerts) for the alert policy. The UI will include the runbook URL in **Incidents** pages and in email notifications as applicable.
</Callout>

Only one person can acknowledge an incident. Once you acknowledge it, you can't undo it. If others try to acknowledge the same incident (for example, from their email notification), the [incident's **History** page](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-incident-dashboard-details#view-violations) will appear, showing that the incident has been acknowledged.

## How to acknowledge incidents [#ack-incident]

The user interface allows you to view incidents and acknowledge them, either from the [**Incidents**](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) index or from the selected incident itself. The **Incidents** page provides details about the incident history so you can more easily analyze the chain of events and their timeline throughout an incident.

To acknowledge an incident from the user interface:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Incidents**, then click **Open incidents** or **All incidents**.
2. From the selected incident row, check whether someone else's name or avatar already appears in the **Acknowledge** column. To find out the user's name, mouse over the avatar.
3. To acknowledge the incident, yourself, select the **Acknowledge** icon. ![040815-icon-ack.png](./images/040815-icon-ack.png "Alerts v3: alert icons")

This automatically notifies everyone who has been set up to receive the notification. The UI also automatically adds your name (or avatar if applicable) to the incident's **Acknowledge** column.

## What happens to additional violations [#view-more-violations]

Your [incident rollup preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) determines whether and how Alerts will group the additional violations in the [**Incidents** page](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history). If you acknowledge an incident and new [violations](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-violation) occur that roll up into the incident you just acknowledged, no further notifications will be sent out until the incident closes.

## Where to view your acknowledged incidents [#view-incident]

To view any incidents you have acknowledged:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Incidents**, then click **Open incidents**.
2. Optional: Use any available search or sort options to refine the index results (not available for the **Acknowledge** column).
3. Select any row that shows your name or avatar to view the [incident's history and details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history).

## What other options to acknowledge are available [#ack-email-mobile]

You can use additional methods (channels) to acknowledge notifications. For example:

* If your notification channel includes email, you can acknowledge the alert at the time you receive it by selecting the email's **Acknowledge** link.
* If you've registered and linked your iOS or Android mobile app to your account, you can add mobile as a notification channel in your policies. For example, Android users can then acknowledge an alert by using the notification bar. You do not need to open the New Relic app.
