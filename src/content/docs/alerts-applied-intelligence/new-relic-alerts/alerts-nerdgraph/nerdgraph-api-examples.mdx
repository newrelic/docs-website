You can manage your policies, conditions, and muting rules programmatically using our [GraphQL NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). This is a powerful alternative to managing them in New Relic One or through the [REST API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts).

## Alerts features you can manage with NerdGraph [#what-you-can-do]

Here's what you can do in NerdGraph:

* [Manage policies](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-policies)
* [Use NRQL conditions](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-alerts-nrql-conditions)
* [Muting rules: suppress notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/muting-rules-suppress-notifications)

The easiest way to discover alerts queries and mutations is through the NerdGraph API explorer.

## NerdGraph API explorer

Our [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) is a GraphiQL editor where you can prototype queries and mutations. Here are some examples showing how to find fields for queries and mutations.
