A [policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology) is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the [REST API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts).

For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).

<Callout variant="tip">
  The [basic setup process](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow) is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source.
</Callout>

## Best practices for naming policies [#best-practices-policies]

We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies:

* Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being
* Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture
* Individual policies for specific users

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Policies organized by...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Architecture
      </td>

      <td>
        Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the **environment** type (production, staging, integration, development) or the **target or resource** type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.).

        To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example:

        * Product A website (production)
        * Product B website (staging)
        * Mobile product app (iOS)
        * Hosts (production)
        * Databases (production)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Teams
      </td>

      <td>
        Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy `Team: Site engineering`, `Team: Website development`, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Individuals
      </td>

      <td>
        Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others.

        To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, `User: John Doe's metrics`, `User: Jane Doe (production)`, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create an alert policy [#alert-policy-name]

As part of the [policy workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow), start by giving the policy a meaningful name:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert conditions (Policies).**
2. On the policy index page, click <Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   **New alert policy**.
3. Type a [meaningful name](#best-practices-policies) for the policy (maximum 64 characters).
4. Select the [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
5. Select **Create alert policy**.

You can continue from here to [define the conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) and [assign one or more notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels). If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the **Alert policies** index.

## Change a policy name [#rename-policy]

For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name.

To rename an existing policy:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert conditions (Policies)**, and then (**select a policy)**.
2. Click the policy name to edit it, then type a [meaningful name](#best-practices-policies) for the policy (maximum 64 characters).

Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels.

## View existing policies [#alert-policy-view]

The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert conditions (Policies).**
2. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list.
3. To view detailed information, click a policy name.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To view [policy and condition information for a specific entity](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/view-policy-conditions-new-relic-products), select the **Settings > Alert conditions** page from the entity's product UI.
</Callout>

## Policy maintenance quick reference [#quick-reference-policies]

After you create a policy, you can:

* Add more conditions to the policy.
* Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds.
* Disable conditions.
* Add one or more notification channels to a policy.
* Rename or delete the policy.

The user interface shows a **Last modified** timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels.

Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies.

  <Collapser
    id="disable-policy"
    title="Disable a policy"
  >
    You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can [disable all of the policy's conditions](#).

    When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the **Alert policies** index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-policy"
    title="Delete a policy"

    If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove **all** policies for the entity, its [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies) indicator will appear light green with an icon.

    If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary.

    To delete a policy completely:

    1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert conditions (Policies).**
    2. From the policy row, click the delete <Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       icon.

       Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must [delete notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/delete-alert-notification-channels) or [remove them](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) individually as necessary.

       In a deleted policy, [incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) and [event violations](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/review-events-across-products) are provided as a read only resource.

    1. Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.).
    2. From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-q-green.png" src={iconAlertsQGreen}/>
