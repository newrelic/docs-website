<Callout variant="important">
  In this document, we use the new terms "issue" and "incident." Please see [this article](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-terminology-coming-for-alerts/163727) for a full explanation of these new terms.
</Callout>

An issue is a collection of one or more incidents.

Issues determine when you are notified about incidents disrupting your business. These incidents occur when your given alert conditions (like CPU overage, synthetic monitoring crashes, or slow web app response times) are met.

Control which policy conditions create issues. This ensures that you are notified about important ongoing or recurring problems and not bombarded by unnecessary notifications.

Learn how to set issue preferences by your policy, condition, or condition and signal combination.

## Critical and warning incidents [#incident-types]

Choose from two threshold types when a policy condition is met:

* Critical (red)
* Warning (yellow)

When a policy condition violates a threshold, an incident is opened and an issue record can be created with detailed information to help you respond efficiently. The issue record may also include any other incidents occurring after the opening incident.

Notifications are sent to every notification channel on the policy as well as all destinations on any workflow that is properly configured when an issue opens, if and when an issue is acknowledged, and when an issue closes.

## Issue preference options [#preference-options]

Each issue preference option has its own advantages. You can select any preference for any policy.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Issue preference**
      </th>

        [One issue per policy (default)](#preference-policy)
      </td>

      <td>
        Only one issue will be open at a time for the entire policy.

        * Fewest number of notifications
        * Requires immediate action and closing the issues to be effective

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [One issue per condition](#preference-condition)
      </td>

      <td>
        One issue will be open at a time for each condition in your policy.

        * More notifications
        * Useful for policies containing conditions that focus on [entities](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#alert-target) that perform the same job; for example, hosts that all serve the same application(s)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [One issue per incident](#preference-target)
      </td>

      <td>
        An issue will be created for every incident in your policy.

        * The most notifications
        * Useful if you need to be notified of every incident or if you have an external system where you want to send alert notifications
      </td>
    </tr>

</table>

## Select your issue preference [#preference-procedures]

By default, a single issue record will be created for each policy.

To change the issue preference for the selected policy:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, and then (**select a policy)**.
2. Click **Issue creation preference**, select your choice of available [options](#preference-options), and then save.

Repeat these steps for each policy as needed.

(Default is **By policy**). To choose a different option for this policy, clickÂ **Issue creation preference**.

## One issue per policy (default) [#preference-policy]

<img

  alt="A diagram showing how the By policy issue preference works"
  src={alertsByPolicy}

<figcaption>
  When you select the default (**One issue per policy**) as your issue preference, it will group all condition incidents into the same issue.
</figcaption>

If additional conditions open incidents after the issue opens, the incidents are added to the same issue. Only one issue appears on your **Issues & activity** page for the selected policy.

Choose the **One issue per policy** preference if your policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like monitoring one entity).

## One issue per condition [#preference-condition]

<img
  title="A diagram showing how the By condition issue preference works"
  alt="A diagram showing how the By condition issue preference works"
  src={alertsByCondition}
/>

<figcaption>
  When you select **One issue per condition** as your issue preference, it will group all incidents by any target for a specific condition into separate issues.
</figcaption>

Choose the **One issue per condition** option when you want an individual issue record to focus on a specific condition. If the policy has multiple conditions, separate issue records for each condition will appear on your **Issues & activity** page.

* If a target violates a condition for the alert policy, an incident will open and an issue record will be created.
* If the same target violates another condition for the alert policy, another incident will open and another issue record will be created.
* If additional targets open incidents on the same condition after the issue opens, these incidents will be added to the issue record already open for that condition.

## One issue per incident [#preference-target]

<img

<figcaption>
  When you select **One issue per incident** as your issue preference, it will not group incidents at all. A new issue will be created for every incident that occurs in your policy.
</figcaption>

The **One issue per incident** option is the most granular level for creating issue records. Choose this issue preference when you want to closely monitor anything that is occurring anywhere across your infrastructure.
