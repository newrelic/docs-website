After you create a policy, you can:

* Add more conditions to the policy.
* Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds.
* Disable conditions.
* Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it.
* Rename or delete the policy.

The user interface shows a **Last modified** timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels.

## Disable or delete policies and conditions [#delete]

If you disable or delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove **all** policies for the entity, its [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies) indicator will appear light green with an icon.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="condition-on-off"
    title="Disable or re-enable a condition"
  >
    You can enable ![041715icon-condition-on](./images/041715icon-condition-on.png "Alerts v3: Condition enabled") or disable ![041715icon-condition-off](./images/041715icon-condition-off.png "Alerts v3: Condition disabled") any policy conditions, and the policy will continue to apply. To disable or re-enable a condition:

    1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, then **(select a policy)**. Then, from the list of **Alert conditions**, **(select a condition)**.
    2. Click the **On/Off** switch to toggle it.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      For Infrastructure conditions, use the checkbox at the bottom of the condition edit screen, then save the condition.
    </Callout>

    If you [copy a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions), it is automatically saved in the new policy as disabled (**Off**), even if the condition was enabled (**On**) in the original policy.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="disable-policy"
    title="Disable a policy"
  >
    You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can [disable all of the policy's conditions](#).

    When you disable all of the conditions, the policy will continue to appear on the **Alert policies** index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-condition"
    title="Delete policy conditions"
  >
    If a policy has multiple conditions, you can delete any or all of them, and the remaining conditions for the policy will continue to apply. To turn a condition off but keep it with the policy, [disable](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions#condition-on-off) it. To delete one or more conditions:

    1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, then **(select a policy)**.
    2. From the list of **Alert conditions**, **(select a condition)**, then click **Delete**.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you don't see the delete button, your account admin may have disabled condition deletion for your organization.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-policy"
    title="Delete a policy"
  >
    If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary.

    To delete a policy completely:

    1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert policies.**
    2. From the policy row, click the delete <Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       icon.

    Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must [delete notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/delete-alert-notification-channels) or [remove them](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) individually as necessary.

    You will still be able to view [incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) and [event violations](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/review-events-across-products) related to the deleted policy. However, these records will be read only.
