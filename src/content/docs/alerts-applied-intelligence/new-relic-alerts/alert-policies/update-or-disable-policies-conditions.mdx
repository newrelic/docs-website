Here's a quick reference for maintaining conditions. This includes the condition's entities (targets), Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) thresholds, and runbook URL.

## Add conditions to a policy [#add-conditions]

To [add more conditions to a policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions):
1.  Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert Policies**
2. Delect a policy.
3. Click **Add a condition**.

To [create a new NRQL condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions): 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert Conditions**
2. Click **Add a condition**.

## Copy a condition [#copy-condition]

To copy an existing condition, including its [targets](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#alert-target) and [thresholds](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#alert-threshold), and add it to another policy for the selected account:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, then select a policy.
2. From the policy's list of one or more **Alert conditions**, click **Copy**.
3. From the **Copy alert condition** list, search or scroll the list to select the policy where you want to add this condition.
4. Optional: Change the condition's name if necessary.
5. Select **Save**.

    By default, the selected alert policy will add the copied condition in the **Disabled** state. Follow standard procedures to [add](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) or copy more conditions to the alert policy, and then [**Enable** the condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions#condition-on-off) as needed. Additionally, the new condition will not copy any [tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-via-ui-api) added to the original condition.

## Configure an existing condition [#configure-condition]

To change a condition, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert Conditions** and click a condition.

* To [change the condition's name](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions#rename-condition) select **Edit** in the ellipses (...) menu for the condition in the list.
* To update the values for the required Critical (red) or optional Warning (yellow) [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert), select **Edit** in the ellipses (...) menu for the condition in the list..
* To update the condition's [runbook URL](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/provide-runbook-instructions-alerts), select **Edit** in the ellipses (...) menu for the condition in the list.


## Enable/disable a condition [#disable-conditions]

You can enable <img title="Alerts v3: Condition enabled" alt="041715icon-condition-on" src={accountsConditionOn}/> or disable <img title="Alerts v3: Condition disabled" alt="041715icon-condition-off" src={accountsConditionOff}/> any conditions, and the policy will continue to apply. To disable or re-enable a condition:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert Conditions**. Then, from the list of **Alert conditions**, use the toggle to enable or disable the condition.
2. Click the **On/Off** switch to toggle it.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      For infrastructure conditions, use the checkbox at the bottom of the condition edit screen, then save the condition.
    </Callout>

If you [copy a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions), it automatically saves it in the new policy as disabled (**Off**), even if the condition was enabled (**On**) in the original policy.
 
## Delete a condition [#delete-conditions]

If a policy has multiple conditions, you can delete any number of them, and the remaining conditions for the policy will continue to apply. To turn a condition off but keep it with the policy, [disable](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions#condition-on-off) it. To delete one or more conditions:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert Conditions**.
2. From the list of **Alert conditions**, select a condition, then click **Delete** from the ellipses menu (...).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you don't see the delete button, your account admin may have disabled condition deletion for your organization.
    </Callout>
