Here's a quick reference for maintaining conditions. This includes the condition's entities (targets), Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) thresholds, and runbook URL.

## Condition maintenance quick reference [#quick-reference-conditions]

    To [add more conditions to a policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions): Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, select a policy, then click **Add a condition**.

    OR

    To [copy a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions) from any policy and add it to another policy: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, select a policy, then click **Copy**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="copy-conditions"

    To copy an existing condition, including its [targets](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#alert-target) and [thresholds](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#alert-threshold), and add it to another policy for the selected account:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, then select a policy.
    2. From the policy's list of one or more **Alert conditions**, click **Copy**.
    3. From the **Copy alert condition** list, search or scroll the list to select the policy where you want to add this condition.
    4. Optional: Change the condition's name if necessary.
    5. Select **Save**.

       By default, the copied condition will be added to the selected alert policy in a **Disabled** state. Follow standard procedures to [add](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) or copy additional conditions to the alert policy, and then [**Enable** the condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions#condition-on-off) as needed. Additionally, any [tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-via-ui-api) added to the original condition will not be copied to the new condition.

## Disable or delete conditions [#delete]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser

    title="Disable or re-enable a condition"
  >
    You can enable <img title="Alerts v3: Condition enabled" alt="041715icon-condition-on" src={accountsConditionOn}/> or disable <img title="Alerts v3: Condition disabled" alt="041715icon-condition-off" src={accountsConditionOff}/> any policy conditions, and the policy will continue to apply. To disable or re-enable a condition:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, then select a policy. Then, from the list of **Alert conditions**, select a condition.
    2. Click the **On/Off** switch to toggle it.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         For infrastructure conditions, use the checkbox at the bottom of the condition edit screen, then save the condition.
       </Callout>

       If you [copy a condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/copy-alert-conditions), it is automatically saved in the new policy as disabled (**Off**), even if the condition was enabled (**On**) in the original policy.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-condition"
    title="Delete conditions"
  >
    If a policy has multiple conditions, you can delete any or all of them, and the remaining conditions for the policy will continue to apply. To turn a condition off but keep it with the policy, [disable](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions#condition-on-off) it. To delete one or more conditions:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions (Policies)**, then select a policy.
    2. From the list of **Alert conditions**, select a condition, then click **Delete**.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         If you don't see the delete button, your account admin may have disabled condition deletion for your organization.
