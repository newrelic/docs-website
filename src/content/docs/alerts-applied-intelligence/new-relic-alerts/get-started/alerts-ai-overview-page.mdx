On the Alerts & AI **Overview** page, you’ll find a consolidated view of your current alerts violations. The **Issues & activity** page has views of your active issues, recent incidents, and anomalies.

## Why it matters [#why]

The **Overview** and **Issues & activity** pages provide analytics on how your system is (or isn't) performing. You can quickly switch between the [**Overview**](#summary), [**Issues**](#issues), [**Incidents**](#incidents), and [**Anomalies**](#anomalies) to scan for critical problems affecting your systems.

## Overview page [#summary]

The overview page shows a high-level view of recent and current alerts violations. With this page, you'll get quick insight into how many critical violations you have, how many have been closed, and which policies are creating the most violations. This page also shows the top sources of your muted violations.

      <td>
        A distribution of how long each violation was open (duration), before being closed. Generally, it's better to have shorter durations for your violations. If you're seeing a lot of long duration violations, you may want to write a custom filter to investigate those more deeply.

## Issues

On the **Issues & activity** page, issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, incident intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. An issue will contain arrays of all the tags (metadata) from all the incidents it contains.

The issues feed includes all of your issues and can be searched and filtered using the top of page component.

By default, the issues feed is filtered to only show the active issues. You can also filter by issue priority, source, alert condition, alert policiy, entity, or issue ID.

By default, issues are sorted by most recently created issue.

Click an issue to open its issue page.

## Incidents

On the **Issues & activity** page, incidents are events that describe the symptoms affecting your system over time. These symptoms are detected by your monitoring tools, which evaluate your data streams and events.

New Relic incident metadata comes from any of the following sources:
- Inheriting all the tags from the alert condition that triggered it
- All the facets, values, and where conditions are added as tags if the NRQL alert condition contains a facet or where condition 
- All the tags from an entity are added if the result of the NRQL alert condition can be mapped to that single entity

[External incident](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/incident-event-rest-api/) medadata is what was received as tag.*.

The incidents feed includes all of your incidents: New Relic incident and external incidents.

You can filter the feed by source, incident state, and priority.

### Default behavior [#default]

By default, the feed is sorted by last updated at the top.

By default, this page shows a list of all your recent anomalies in the selected account. Select an anomaly to view a detailed analysis and more context.
