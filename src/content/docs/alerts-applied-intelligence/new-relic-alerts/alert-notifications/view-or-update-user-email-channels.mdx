Alerts automatically includes the [email addresses](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#email) for all users in the selected account as individual notification channels. If this is a [sub-account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/creating-sub-accounts), the list shows only the sub-account users, not all the users in the master account.

## View account email channels [#view-users]

To view or search the list of user names and emails: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Notification channels**. In the search field, search for 'user'.

## Add or update user channels [#account-users]

Users can't unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. The account Owner or Admin must remove them from the policy's notification channel.

To add or update account users as notification channels for a policy:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, click **Policies**, and then choose the policy you want to change.
2. Optional: You can update notification channels for specific users. On the **Notification channels page,** select a user, select any policy subscription already associated with the user as applicable to view policy details.
3. Click **Notification channels**, then follow [standard procedures](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) to add notification channels.
4. Click **Update policy**.
