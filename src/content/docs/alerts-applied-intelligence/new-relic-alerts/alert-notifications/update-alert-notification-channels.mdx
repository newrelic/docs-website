To keep alert notifications consistent with your business needs, manage your channels.

When you make updates, you can rename a channel, add policies to an existing channel, create a new channel entirely, and more.

 <Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
   We're replacing notification channels with more powerful workflows. Existing notifications will be automatically migrated to workflows that provide      more options, flexibility, and control and you can enrich notifications with additional data.
  [Learn about workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/)

    Alerts automatically includes the [email addresses](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#email) for all users in the selected account as individual notification channels. If the account is a [child account](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), the list shows only the users on the child account, not the users in the parent account.

    To view or search the list of user names and emails: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Channels**. In the search field, search for 'user'.
