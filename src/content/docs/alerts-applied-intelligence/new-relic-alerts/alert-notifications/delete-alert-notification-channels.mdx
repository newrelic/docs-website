You can delete a notification channel when your alerts needs change, for example, when you're no longer monitoring a condition.

 <Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
   We're replacing notification channels with more powerful workflows. Existing notifications will be automatically migrated to workflows that provide      more options, flexibility, and control and you can enrich notifications with additional data.

## Delete a channel [#delete]

To delete a channel permanently:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Channels**.
2. Optional: To find the notification channel easily, search the **Notification channels** index.
3. From the **Notification channels** index, select the channel's delete icon, and then select the confirmation prompt to cancel or continue.

When you delete (or remove) a channel, any policies associated with it will still remain. You must [delete policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions) separately.
