You can delete a notification channel when your alerts needs change, for example, when you're no longer monitoring a condition.

<Callout variant="caution">
  If you delete a channel, you cannot restore it. If you want to keep the notification channel, you can [remove](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) it from any associated policy.
</Callout>

## Delete a channel [#delete]

To delete a channel permanently:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Notification channels**.
2. Optional: To find the notification channel easily, search the **Notification channels** index.
3. From the **Notification channels** index, select the channel's delete icon, and then select the confirmation prompt to cancel or continue.

When you delete (or remove) a channel, any policies associated with it will still remain. You must [delete policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/updating-alert-policies/disable-or-delete-alert-policies-conditions) separately.
