You can use [alerts](/docs/alerts) to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to [policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow#terminology). Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team.

Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up.

   <Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
   We're replacing notification channels with more powerful workflows. Existing notifications will be automatically migrated to workflows that provide      more options, flexibility, and control and you can enrich notifications with additional data.

## View notification channels [#view-channels]

To see all notification channels in your account: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Channels**.

## Add or remove notification channels [#add-channel]

To set up a new notification channel:

1. On the **Notification channels,** click **New notification channel**.
2. Select the [type of channel](#channel-types) and complete other required steps for it.

To add or remove a notification policy or channel:

* Select a specific [notification channel](#view-channels), select **Alert policies**, and add or remove a policy.

  OR
* Select a specific [policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-or-rename-alert-policy#alert-policy-view), select **Notification channels**, and add or remove a channel.

## Instructions for specific notification channels [#channel-types]

These are the available notification channel types.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="user"
    title="User"
  >
    **Requirement**: This feature is not available for users on our newer user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about [user model differences](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models)). As a workaround, you can use the [email notification channel](#email).

    Use the **User** notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the **Users** list or to [add users to alert policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/view-or-update-user-email-channels): Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Channels**.

    If a user has [configured the New Relic mobile app](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-mobile-apps/authentication-alerts/alerting-new-relic-mobile-apps/), the user notification channel also sends [push notifications](#mobile-push) to any of the user's registered mobile devices.

    If your account has one or more [child accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts), the notification channel includes only users for the [currently selected parent or child account](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/use-multiple-accounts).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="email"
    title="Email"
  >
    We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the [**User** notification channel](#user) and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the **Email** channel.

    To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width={200}>
            Field
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Email (required)
          </td>

          <td>
            In general, use the **Email** notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are **not** already on the selected account. For example, if you have a `dev-ops@company.com` email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the **Email** channel. Otherwise, use the [**User** notification channel](#user) to select specific users on your DevOps team.

            For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the [email channel](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/view-or-update-user-email-channels) for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account.

            Users can [unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails](/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/unsubscribe-new-relic-emails), but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or [add-on manager](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/add-roles-permissions) must [remove users](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/view-or-update-user-email-channels) from the policy's email notification channel.

    Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to [customize the payload](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/customize-your-webhook-payload) in the POST message for further integration into your system.

      If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident.

## Receive mobile push notifications [#mobile-push]

<Callout variant="important">
  In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in **(account) > User preferences**. If the device is not listed in **User preferences**, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed.
</Callout>

To receive mobile push notifications:

1. Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.
<InlineSignup/>
2. [Add the user channel](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/view-or-update-user-email-channels#account-users) to the alert policy.
3. Switch push notifications **On** for the device.

## Acknowledge alert notifications [#ack-notification]

Anyone in your account can [acknowledge notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/acknowledge-alert-incidents) through the user interface or email notification.

Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in [PagerDuty](#pagerduty).
