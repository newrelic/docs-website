<Callout title="BETA FEATURE">
This feature is currently in beta.
</Callout>

With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.

## Add a Workflow

The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu.

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com), click **Alerts & AI**, in the left navigation under **Enrich and Respond** click **Workflow**, then click **Add a workflow**.

<Callout variant="tip">
The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000
</Callout>

2. Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique

3. Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting **Send all issues** or you can build a query to filter the right issues.

4. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on.

5. Optional:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="enrich"
    title="Enrichments"
  >
- Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them
- The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder.
- The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message.
- If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher.
- You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example `{{entities.ids}}`
- Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow.

<Callout variant="important">
    The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1.
</Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="notif"
        title="Notifier"
    >
- In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier.
- Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. 
- You can either set it up through the **Destination** menu item, or through the **Create new destination item** in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen.        
- A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform.
- Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

6. Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking **activate**. 

<Callout variant="tip">
In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name.
</Callout>

## Variables

To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the `where` statement of the query. 

For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use:

```
FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10
```

This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way.

<Callout variant="important">
Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. `{{ json entities.Ids}}` ).  
</Callout>

## Destinations

Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. 

Destinations are located under the **Alerts and AI** menu. 

### Add a Destination

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com), **click Alerts & AI**, in the left navigation under **Enrich and Respond** , then click **Destinations**.
2. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="webhook"
    title="Webhook destination"
  >
Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires:

- A unique destination name
- The endpoint url of the target application
- Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’
    - Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header.
    - Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources 

![An image showing webhook configuration](./images/webhook.png "webhook")

To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="servicenow"
    title="ServiceNow incidents destination"
  >

Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires:
- Unique notifier name
- ServiceNow domain endpoint
- A username and password
- Optional: enable two-way integration

<Callout variant="important">
The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request
Optional: enable two-way integration 
</Callout>

![An image showing how to configure ServiceNow](./images/servicenow.png "ServiceNow")


You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration:

The following steps are required to enable two-way integration:
1. Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier.
2. Open and download this [XML file](https://storage.cloud.google.com/newrelic-connect/workflows-proxy-production.xml)(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows).
3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule.
4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded.
 
We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials
 
After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. 
 
Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="jira"
    title="Jira destination"
  >
Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket.
With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic.
 
Atlassian Jira notifiers need:
- Notifier name
- Jira url endpoint 
- A username
- Jira API key

![An image showing how to configure jira](./images/jira.png "Jira")

After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed.

Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.
