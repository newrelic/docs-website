With workflows you control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.

## What is an issue [#issue]
Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. For more information see [Use Incident Inteligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/use-incident-intelligence/).

## Add a Workflow [#add-workflow]

The workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu.

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com), click **Alerts & AI**, in the left navigation under **Enrich and Notify** click **Workflow**, then click **Add a workflow**.

<Callout variant="tip">
The maximum number of workflows you can add is 100 per environment and 50 per account.
</Callout>

2. Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique.

3. Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting **Send all issues** or you can build a query to filter the right issues.

4. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on.

5. Optional: Enriched Data, available to [full platform users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type).

  - Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them
  - The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder.
  - The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message.
  - If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher.
  - You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example `{{entitiesData.ids}}`
  - For enrichment example see [Workflow data enrichment examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples/).
  - Note: The query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow.

    <Callout variant="important">
      At this stage, visual representation of enrichments are sent to Slack and email. For Servicenow and JIRA destinations, we recommend to limit to NRDB queries with single value results. For example: count, min, or max.
      
      The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 5. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1.

6. Notify -  Choose one or more destinations and add an optional message.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="notifier"
    title="Notifier"
  >
  
  - In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier.
  - Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. 
  - You can either set it up through the **Destination** menu item, or through the **Create new destination item** in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen.        
  - A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform.
  - To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, [check the documentation on notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/).

</CollapserGroup>

7. Click **update message** once completing the notifier requirements
8. Optionally, test your workflow. We'll use existing data from your account to test what you've configured and send a sample notification
9. Click **activate** to complete the workflow.

<Callout variant="tip">
In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You'll see the names of the variables, which will be replaced with the variable's values at runtime. To use the enrichers' results, use their name.
</Callout>
