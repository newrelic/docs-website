## Workflow data enrichment examples [#enrichment-examples]

To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the `where` statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use:

```
SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' and entityName in {{entitiesData.names}}
```

This query returns a single value (for example, `stopped`), as the query only uses a single field. The variable `entitiesData.names` is a list of identifiers for the entities. You can use any other entity properties in the same way.

You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways:

    There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the &#x7B;&#x7B;entitiesData.names}} variable in place of your application's name.

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName in {{entitiesData.names}} since 10 minutes ago

    ```

    Number of requests per minute the impacted enitities process

    There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the &#x7B;&#x7B;entitiesData.names}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold.

    ```
    From Transaction select latest(http.statusCode), average(duration) where appName in {{entitiesData.names}}

    Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = {{entitiesData.names}} since 1 hour ago.
