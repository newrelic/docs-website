Alert coverage gaps highlight services in your stack where you're missing alert coverage. It gives your team a comprehensive list of all entities that your team is not currently covering. This feature helps you to prevent incidents before they happen because you're not going to miss valuable data.

What does covering an entity mean? A covered entity means that you've set up an [alert](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms) to notify you of how a particular entity is performing. For example, you might have created an alert condition that opens an incident if the throughput of an APM entity exceeds 100 requests per minute. An uncovered entity is part of your system that is unmonitored which means there could be unhealthy behavior that goes unchecked. 

## Find your coverage gaps [#find-your-coverage-gaps]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then select **Alert Coverage Gaps** on the left navigation pane to open the alert coverage gaps page. There is a list of all your entitites that are not currently covered.

Depending on the covered entities, this page can include these tabs:

* **APM**
* **AWS RDS Clusters**
* **Browser**
* **Consulagent**
* **CoreDNS**
* **IBMMQQueue**
* **Mobile**
* **Open Telemetry (External Services)**
* **PixiePostgres**
* **PixieRedis**
* **SAP Job**
* **SAP Transaction**
* **Service Levels**
* **Synthetic Monitors**

If there are no uncovered entities, you won't see that specific tab.

## Create an alert from your alert coverage gaps [#create-an-alert]

Once you've selected an entity you'd like to monitor, then you can create an alert condition to notify your team of any abnormal behavior. 

New Relic will dynamically suggest the conditions we believe should be monitored based on the selected entity and your specific system. Some of the recommended alerts we might suggest are error percentage, apdex, or response time. 

You'll get recommended alert conditions based on the entity type's defined [Golden Metrics](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions). If you don't get recommended alert conditions, once you select an alert condition you'd like to monitor, then your team will be alerted when this signal deviates from its normal baseline, upper and lower, for at least 5 minutes by 3.00 standard deviations.

To create an alert from your alert coverage gaps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then select **Alert Coverage Gaps** on the left navigation pane.

2. Click **Add alert** on the entity you want to create the alert.

3. Add the recommended conditions you want.

      To create an alert for an unmonitored entity, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, select **Alert coverage gaps** in the left navigation pane, and click **Add alert**.

4. Click **Next**.

5. Select a policy to get notified. Every alert condition needs to be routed through a [policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) so you have to either select an existing policy or create a new one. 



Once you've selected or created a policy attached to the alert condition, then you might need to add a [destination](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations). Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. You can link your notifications to third-party tools like Slack, Atlassian Jira, email, and more.

    />

      When you create an alert you will select which policy the alert will be grouped with.

6. Click **Activate conditions** to save the conditions. If the policy is new, you'll see the **Save & set up notifications** button. Use this button if you want to save the conditions and the notifications.
