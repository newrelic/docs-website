As part of [Applied Intelligence](/docs/introduction-new-relic-ai), Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events.

## Requirements [#requirements]

If you haven't already, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to get started.

To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). For more information, see [capabilities by user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#user-type-comparison-table).   

## Set up Incident Intelligence [#get-started]

To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed.

* [1. Configure your environment (one-time)](#1-configure-environment).
* [2. Configure sources](#1-configure-sources).
* [3. Configure destinations](#2-configure-destinations).
* [4. Configure pathways](#3-configure-pathways).

## 1. Configure your environment (one-time) [#1-configure-environment]

To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using.

* **Who sets the environment?** Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges.
* **Can administrators set more than one environment?** They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events.
</Callout>

## 2. Configure sources [#1-configure-sources]

After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs.

You can get data from any of the following sources:

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-rest-api"
    title="REST API"
  >
    Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event.

    * A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI.
    * An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe.

    You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input.

    For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see [REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence](/docs/rest-api-new-relic-ai).

## 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) [#2-configure-destinations]

Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents.

###  Configure ServiceNow (example) [#configure-servicenow]

Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="servicenow-destination"
    title="Send data to ServiceNow"
  >
    To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**, in the left nav under **Incident Intelligence** click **Destinations**, then click **ServiceNow**.
    2. **Required:** Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways).
    3. **Required:** Enter your ServiceNow credentials:
       1. Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain).
       2. Username
       3. Password
    4. Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions:
       1. Open and download this [XML file](https://storage.cloud.google.com/newrelic-connect/workflows-proxy-production.xml).
       2. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rule**.
       3. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded.

    The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue.

    Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue.

    When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed.

    ## Custom notification message [#custom-message]

    Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in [valid](https://cryptic-cliffs-32040.herokuapp.com/) Jinja syntax.

    By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow.

    When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use.
    
    When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the `| skip_on_update` string at the end of the value you've selected.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      By default, ServiceNow adds `u_` to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value.
    </Callout>

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Other destinations [#other-destinations]

You can set other destinations:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="pager-duty-destination"
    title="Send data to PagerDuty"
  >
    <Callout title="EOL NOTICE">
      As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-node-agents-suggested-pagerduty-responders-golden-signals-and-components-incident-workflows-mobile-agent-cross-application-tracing-cat-and-kubernetes-instrumentation/164481).
    </Callout>
    
    **Recommended**: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output.

    To create a PagerDuty destination:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**, in the left nav under **Incident Intelligence** click **Destinations**, then click **PagerDuty**.
    2. Enter your [PagerDuty API key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys).
       * The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key.
    3. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click **Connect**.

    When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed.

    From the **Destinations > PagerDuty** page, you can also:

    * Review the permissions for your services. Click **Authorize** when you're done.
    * Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination.
    * Edit permissions for any service.

    To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>

            **Required**. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Add webhook extensions
          </td>

          <td>
            Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Auto-resolve correlated incidents
          </td>

          <td>

            Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty
          </td>

          <td>
            You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can:

            * **Add notes to incidents (required)**: Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context.
            * **Acknowledge triggered incidents**: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified.
            * **Use the original escalation policy**: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident.

      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="webhook-destination"
    title="Send data via webhook"
  >
    Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (`2xx`).

    To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**, in the left nav under **Incident Intelligence** click **Destinations**, then click **Webhook**.
    2. **Required:** Configure the unique `webhook key`, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings.
    3. **Required:** Configure the `destination endpoint` where the webhook payload will be sent.
    4. Optional steps:
       * Configure `custom headers`, which are `key:value` pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: `"Authentication" "Bearer" <bearer token>`
       * Configure a `custom payload` template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format.
       * Configure `priority mapping` (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination.

<Callout variant="tip">  
There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled.
</Callout>

</Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the [Incident Intelligence destination examples](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/incident-intelligence-destination-examples).

## 4. Configure pathways [#3-configure-pathways]

To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways.

**To add a pathway:**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**, in the left nav under **Incident Intelligence** click **Pathways**, then click **Add a pathway**.
2. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as `application/name`.
   * This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes.
3. Select a logical operator. For example, `contains`.
4. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression.

   * To include all issues created by your sources, select **Send everything**. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.)
   * To build more complex logic, use the `AND/OR` operators.
5. Select one or more of your [destinations](#2-configure-destinations).

To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the **Pathways** page.

## What's next? [#next]

Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about [how to use Incident Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/).
