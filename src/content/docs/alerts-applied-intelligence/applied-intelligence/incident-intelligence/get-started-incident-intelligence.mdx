As part of [Applied Intelligence](/docs/introduction-new-relic-ai), Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events.

If you haven't already, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to get started.

<Callout variant="important">
Pathways have been deprecated, and are replaced by [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).

If you still have access to Pathways on New Relic One, reach out to your New Relic account representative and ask to be upgraded.
</Callout>

## Set up Incident Intelligence [#get-started]

To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed.

* [1. Configure your environment (one-time)](#1-configure-environment).
* [2. Configure sources](#1-configure-sources).
* [3. Configure destinations](#2-configure-destinations).
* [4. Configure workflows](#3-configure-workflows).

## 1. Configure your environment (one-time) [#1-configure-environment]

To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using.

* **Who sets the environment?** Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges.
* **Can administrators set more than one environment?** They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events.
</Callout>

## 2. Configure sources [#1-configure-sources]

After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs.

You can get data from any of the following sources:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-nr-alerts"
    title="Alerts"
  >
    By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring.

    To get data from alerts:

    1. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts**.
    2. On the left under **Incident Intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **Alerts**.
    3. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click **Connect**.

    You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in **Sources > Alerts**.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications.

    <Callout title="EOL NOTICE">
      As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-node-agents-suggested-pagerduty-responders-golden-signals-and-components-incident-workflows-mobile-agent-cross-application-tracing-cat-and-kubernetes-instrumentation/164481).
    </Callout>

    You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications.

    To get data from PagerDuty:

    1. Make sure your [PagerDuty API key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys) has write access.
    2. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**.
    3. On the left under **Incident Intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **PagerDuty**.
    4. Enter your [PagerDuty API key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys).
       * The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin.
    5. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click **Connect**.

    You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in **Sources > PagerDuty**.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-prometheus"
    title="Prometheus Alertmanager"
  >
    By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources.

    To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager:

    1. Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running:

       ```
       ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml
       ```
    2. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Alerts & AI**. 
    3. On the left under **Incident Intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **Prometheus Alertmanager**.
    4. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the `<webhook_config>/url` section of your Alertmanager config file.
    5. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods:
       * Send a `SIGHUP` to the process.
       * Send an HTTP `POST` request to the `/-/reload` endpoint.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-rest-api"
    title="REST API"
  >
    Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event.

    * A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI.
    * An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe.

    You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input.

    For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see [REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence](/docs/rest-api-new-relic-ai).

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-splunk"
    title="Splunk"
  >
    By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can:

    * Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports.
    * Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher.
    </Callout>

    To get data from Splunk:

    1. In your **Splunk console**, start a search for the relevant events.
    2. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method.
    3. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Alerts & AI**. 
    4. On the left under **Incident Intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **Splunk**.
    5. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console.
    6. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to [enrich alert data with Splunk metadata](#enrich-splunk-search).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="enrich-splunk-search"
    title="Splunk metadata"
  >
    To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results.
