The incident events API allows you to report any related activities from your own proprietary incident management systems for advanced correlation and reasoning. The API is designed in a generic way with minimal required attributes and flexibility to keep native keys and values of your incident events.

The more information your system can provide, the better our decision engine works to surface more relevant information to you. Use the attributes field to push your specific information in addition to the required fields.

## Authentication

The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. To get your secure token, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts & AI**, in the left nav under **Incident intelligence** click **Sources**, then click **REST API**.

Your user account must have permissions to manage Sources to get a secure token.

### Batching data

We currently support up to 10 events in the same API call. In order to batch, just append new event data to the body.

A batch must be POSTed as `{"events": [{"event_source": "Snap", ...}]}` with each event part in a list that is the value of "events", as the following sample shows.

**Sample JSON**

```
{
    "events": [{
        "application": "Name of my application",
        "attributes": {
            "alert/description": "Add a description about the alert itself",
            "state": "alarm",
            "application/state": "MAJOR",
            "environment": "prod"
        },
        "event_description": "Add a description about the incident",
        "event_source": "List the application that created the incident",
        "host": "host-name",
        "value": "medium"
    }]
}
```

Our collector will first check to see if `events` is the key in the root object and if so, extract and iterate.

### Default data size limits [#size-limits]

* Batch – up to 10 messages inside the body.
* We support up to 20 attributes per metric or event.
* Each string value field size is limited to 1024 characters.
* Each attribute name field size is limited to 128 characters.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have different requirements for data size/restrictions please contact us as those parameters can be tuned for you.
</Callout>

### Make API calls [#get-started]

On the incident intelligence **Sources** page, click **REST API**. Choose the correct account and click on the clipboard icon to copy the collector URL. The security token should be used in the **Authorization: Bearer HTTP** header.

Here is an example curl command using this interface:

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://collectors.signifai.io/v1/incidents' -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXX' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"application": "A Unique App Name","attributes": {"alert/description": "The health check end-point is failing for A Unique App Name","annotations/description": "Health check failure","cluster/name": "auan_001","datacenter/name": "US-EAST-1","health_check/entity_name": "a-unique-app-name","service/name": "a-unique-app-name","service/status": "down","state": "alarm","label/namespace": "use labels to control how events aggregate into incidents"},"event_description": "Something in the health check failed for A Unique App Name","event_source": "my-rest-api","value": "critical"}'
```

        This is a flat key/value mapping of additional attributes about the incident event. We recommend putting as much information and meta data as you can here.

        Any attributes added here will be used to perform better correlations.

        Labels are defined within the attributes object. Labels allow you to control how the de-duplication step works for your events. See [De-duplication and identification](#de-duplication) below.

        **Example**:

        `{"attributes": {`

        `"affected_cluster": "cluster foo",`

        `"team": "SRE Infra Team",`

## De-duplication and identifications [#de-duplication]

To better support our system’s advanced de-duplication and correlation capabilities, we recommend supplying a set of labels or an alert ID, as part of the incident’s `attributes`.

Any attribute prefixed with `label/` is considered as a label.

The combination of the labels, `event_source`, `host`, `application`, and `server` are used to create unique incidents. If labels are not provided, provide an `alert/id` attribute to be used as a de-duplication key.

## Significant incident attributes (hints) [#hint-attributes]

Some attributes have enhanced capabilities. Sending these allows us to process the data more intelligently.

        Every incident that is received with the same `alert/id` will be aggregated to the same open incident.

        **Important**: Specifying `alert/id` manually will deactivate New Relic's automatic creation of an alert ID using the defined labels.
