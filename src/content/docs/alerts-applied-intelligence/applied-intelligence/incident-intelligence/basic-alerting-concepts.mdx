To make the best use of New Relic alerting and applied intelligence features, it will help you to understand some basic terms and concepts.

You set up alerts for your telemetry data by configuring alert **conditions**, which define what will constitute a violation and trigger an **incident**. For example, you might want to create an alert condition that opens an incident if a host's CPU goes above 80%. Incidents result in an **issue**, which is the thing that actually results in notifications.

Conditions live inside an alert **policy**. The policy contains higher-level settings that govern all the conditions in that policy. One setting is **issue creation preference**, which governs how multiple incidents can get grouped into a single issue. For example, you might decide that every incident gets its own issue, or you might group them by condition, or you might group them by policy. We have built-in **decisions**, which are logical operations that group issues into larger issues (you can also create your own custom decisions). 

Issues in turn can trigger **workflows**, which are what give you control over how issues are turned into notifications. **Destinations** are the services by which you get notified. We support common services like Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, and also simple web hooks. It's good practice to carefully manage the setup of destinations so that users aren't creating redundant destinations.
