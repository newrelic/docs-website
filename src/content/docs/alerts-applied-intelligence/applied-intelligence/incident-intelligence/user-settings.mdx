metaDescription: "Use the incident intelligence settings to set your grace period and inactive issue time policies."
---

For incident intelligence, our grace period setting controls how much time should pass before you're notified about an issue. Our inactive issues setting controls how long you want to wait before an inactive issue is automatically closed.

These settings apply to all data coming in to your account.

To find your incident intelligence settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI > General**.

## Grace period policy [#grace-period]

The grace period is used to cut down on the number of unnecessary notifications you see. Specifically, the grace period is the time between when an issue is created and when it's possible for that issue to create notifications. 

For each priority level, you can set the grace period separately from 0 to 20 minutes. The higher the time period, the more time our system has to analyze and correlate new activity with past activity.

If you've set your [incident preference](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/specify-when-alerts-create-incidents/#preference-options) to `By condition and signal`, your grace period is always 0 minutes.

If there are any notifications to send, they're sent when the grace period time has elapsed.

The grade period default values are:

* Low: 15 minutes
* Medium: 10 minutes
* High: 5 minutes
* Critical: 1 minute

## Auto Close Issue Window [#auto-close-issue-window]

The auto close issues setting controls how much time elapses before an inactive issue is automatically closed. The range is from 1-30 days and the default value is 3 days.

<Callout variant="tip">
This setting is related to the [close open violation setting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-violations/how-alert-condition-violations-are-closed/#time-limit) for each condition.

When the time periods in these two settings are different, our system uses the shorter time period, regardless of the setting. For example, if the close open violation time setting is 2 days and the inactive issue time setting is 3 days, our system would wait 2 days before closing the issue.

## Inactive Issue [#inactiv-issue]

When an issue is inactive, it won't be aggregated or correlated by our system. For example, if a new issue comes in that's similar to the inactive issue, it's treated as new, rather than correlated to the inactive issue.

An issue is considered inactive when it has collected 5,000 incidents.

After 30 days, an inactive issue will be automatically closed.
