New Relic's Incident Intelligence service is performed solely in the United States. By using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center).

If you elect to use the Suggested Responder feature and manage EU-based individuals, you may need to confirm that an appropriate data processing agreement is in place.
