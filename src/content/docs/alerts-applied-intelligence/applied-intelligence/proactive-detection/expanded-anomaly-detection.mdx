  This feature is a limited release and we're no longer accepting requests to sign up.
</Callout>

We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor.

## Why it matters

When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble.

Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system.

## Get started with anomaly detection

To get started with expanded anomaly detection:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to **Alerts & AI > Anomaly detection**.
2. Click **+ Add a configuration**.
3. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor.
4. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend **Low** sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies.
5. Finally, name your configuration and save.

## Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query

To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to **Alerts & AI > Anomaly detection**.
2. Click **+ Add a configuration**.
3. Click **Use a query instead**. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one.
4. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies.
5. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend **Low** sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies.
6. Finally, name the configuration and save.

## See your anomalies in one place

When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout the UI and the **Anomalies** tab as soon as they’re detected.

Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the `NrAiAnomaly` event.
</Callout>

To view anomalies, from [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to **Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies**.

## Query anomaly data

Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/#anomaly-events).

## Reduce the number of detected anomalies

If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to **Low**.

If it’s already set to **Low**, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.

To define custom thresholds:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to **Alerts & AI > Anomaly detection > Settings**.
2. Click the configuration you want to modify.
3. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level.

You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.
