<Callout title="Early access">
The features described here are early access.

For more information on related features, see our docs on [Alerts notification channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/), [Incident Intelligence destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/), and [Proactive Detection notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/#set-up).

Destinations are unique identifiers for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send your notifications. Destination settings contain connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic One.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Email
* Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook

For more on these destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/notification-integrations).

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).
