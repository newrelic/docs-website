Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Atlassian Jira: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) and [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/).
* ServiceNow: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Slack: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) and [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/).
* Webhook: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Email: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* AWS EventBridge: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* PagerDuty: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* New Relic Mobile Push: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).

For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).


## Required capabilities [#requirements]

Destination settings require specific [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities):

* To access settings: `View` capabilities for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.
* To modify or delete settings: `Modify` capabilities for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.

## Manage destinations [#manage-destinations]

<figcaption>
  Go to **one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Destinations**. Use destinations to choose where your notifications are sent.
</figcaption>

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com/one.newrelic.com), click **Alerts & AI**, and in the left nav under **Enrich and Notify**, click **Destinations**. The destinations table shows information about the existing destinations and allows users to enable, disable, and modify.
2. To add a destination, click the appropriate platform tile. To modify destination settings, click the destination row in the destinations table.

You can also configure destinations with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-destinations).

### Destination status [#manage-destinations]

Destinations have a 'status' value that indicates if we encountered issues while processing and sending events to them (see the destinations table in the above image).

Some errors, like Authentication or Authorization issues, require an update to the destination's connection details. After the update, the destination status value will be changed to "Default".

## Notifications log [#notifications-log]

To view past notification events details, go to the **Destination** menu, and click the **Notifications log** tab.

Notifications log enable you to view the history and status of all your past notifications. Here you can view the status of any notification along with related error details and destination ticket numbers.

## Error notifier [#Notifier-errors]

If, for any reason, a notification event fails to send, the consequential error will be sent to `NrIntegrationError` under the category `NotificationError`.

This is especially useful if using the `Alert conditions (policies)` and [workflows](docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) features. This way, you can build a condition which triggers on the event of a notification error, and a new notification can be sent elsewhere.

A step-by-step demo of adding an error notifier can be found below:

  id="b89ctyjolq"
/>

Example condition:

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM NrIntegrationError
WHERE category = 'NotificationError'
```

Then, you can use this condition in the query builder of the workflow configuration, where you can also define an event template.

## Snoozed destination [#Snoozed-destination]

Snoozing:
In order to minimize error noise on faulty destinations, we "snooze" destinations. If, within the period of two hours, sending a notification to a specific destination returns more than ten errors, we do not try to send notifications to that destination. This is released after the two hour period.

Retrying:
For specific types of errors, we retry sending the same notification. These retries are not counted in the error count for snoozing.
For timeout errors, the notification is tried a total of two times, with a 1 second delay in between.
For throttling errors, the notification is tried a total of three times, with a 5 second delay in between.
