<Callout title="Early access">
The features described here are early access. You won't be able to use these features if you're not part of the early access program.

For more information on related features, see our docs on [Alerts notification channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/), [Incident Intelligence destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/), and [Proactive Detection notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/#set-up).
</Callout>

Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic One data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use. 

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic One.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Email
* Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook

For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).
