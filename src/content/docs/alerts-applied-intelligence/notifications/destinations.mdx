<Callout title="Early access">
The features described here are early access. You won't be able to use these features if you're not part of the early access program.

For more information on related features, see our docs on [Alerts notification channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/), [Incident Intelligence destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/), and [Proactive Detection notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/#set-up).
</Callout>

Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic One data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use. 

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic One.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Atlassian Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook
* Email (Coming soon!)
* PagerDuty (Coming soon!)
* AWS EventBridge (Coming soon!)

For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).

### Destination status [#manage-destinations]

Destinations have a 'status' value that indicates if we encountered issues while processing and sending events to them (see the destinations table in the above image).
Some errors, like Authentication or Authorization issues, require an update to the destination's connection details. After the update, the destination status value will be changed to "Default".  

## Notifications log [#notifications-log]

To view past notification events details, go to the **Destination** menu, and click the **Notifications log** tab.

Notifications log enable you to view the history and status of all your past notifications. Here you can view the status of any notification along with related error details and destination ticket numbers.
