Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Atlassian Jira: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/), [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/).
* ServiceNow: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Slack: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/), [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/), and [Discussions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/collaborate/collaboration-slack-integration/).
* Webhook: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Email: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) and [Discussions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/collaborate/collaborate-with-teammates/).
* AWS EventBridge: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* PagerDuty: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* New Relic Mobile Push: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).

For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).


## Required capabilities [#requirements]

Destination settings require specific [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities):

* To access settings: `View` capabilities for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.
* To modify or delete settings: `Modify` capabilities for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.

## Manage destinations [#manage-destinations]

  Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Destinations**. Use destinations to choose where your notifications are sent.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Enrich and Notify > Destinations**. The destinations table shows information about the existing destinations and allows users to enable, disable, and modify.
2. To add a destination, click the appropriate platform tile. To modify destination settings, click the destination row in the destinations table.

You can also configure destinations with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-destinations).

## Destinations and Notifications Status [#destinations-and-notifications-statuses]

### Destination statuses [#destinations-statuses]

Destinations have a 'status' value that indicates if we encountered issues while processing and sending events to them.

To track errors, it's recommanded to visit the [Notifications-log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations/#notifications-log) and the [NrIntegrationError event](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events/#error-details).

There are these statuses:

* DEFAULT. The integration works properly.
* CONFIGURATION_ERROR. This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a configuration error. 
* THROTTLING_WARNING. This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a throttling error. The number of notification requests exceeds your third-party system's rate limitation.
* UNINSTALLED. The New Relic application isn't installed and this destination is no longer available (Applicable for Slack).
* EXTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR. This destination isn't receiving notifications due to an external server error. For more information, please check your third-party system.
* TIMEOUT_ERROR. This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a timeout. For more information, please revisit the destination configuration and your third-party system status.
* AUTH_ERROR. This destination isn't receiving notifications. Please verify your destination credentials.
* UNKNOWN_ERROR. This destination isn't receiving notifications due to an unknown error.

The status of the destination is presented in the Destinations table and at the 'select a destination' phase, while setting the Channel-template.
It's also possible to review the state using the Nerdgraph API ('status' property.)

### Notifications log [#notifications-log]

To view past notification events details, go to the **Destination** menu, and click the **Notifications log** tab.

A notifications log enables you to view the history and status of all your past notifications. Here you can view the status of any notification along with related error details and destination ticket numbers.

### Error notifier [#Notifier-errors]

If, for any reason, a notification event fails to send, the consequential error will be sent to `NrIntegrationError` under the category `NotificationError`.

This is especially useful if using the `Alert conditions (policies)` and [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) features. This way, you can build a condition which triggers on the event of a notification error, and a new notification can be sent elsewhere.

A step-by-step demo of adding an error notifier can be found below:
<Video
  type="wistia"
  id="b89ctyjolq"
/>

Example condition:

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM NrIntegrationError
WHERE category = 'NotificationError'
```

Then, you can use this condition in the query builder of the workflow configuration, where you can also define an event template.

### Snoozed destination [#Snoozed-destination]

Snoozing:
In order to minimize error noise on faulty destinations, we "snooze" destinations. If, within the period of two hours, sending notifications to a specific destination are fail (at least 1- notification events), we will 'snooze' the destination for a few minutes. In this period, we won't be sending notifications to that destination.
