Notifications are a consolidation of the different ways to send notification-events to third-party services, such as Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and email. You can also use webhooks to send your data to any compatible third-party service.

Notifications are made up of destinations, message templates, and specific notification integrations.

## Destinations [#destinations]

A destination is a third-party service where you'd like to send New Relic One data. 

## Message templates [#message-templates]

We've provided message templates to map New Relic One data to your third-party services.

## Notification integrations [#integrations]

The notification integrations are the specific services we support sending your data to. You can also send your data to any third-party service that supports webhooks.
