Notifications are a consolidation of the different ways to send notification-events to third-party services, such as Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and email. You can also use webhooks to send your data to any compatible third-party service.

Integrate with your systems by configuring destinations and message templates.

## Destinations [#destinations]

Destinations are unique identifiers and connection details for third-party systems. Use destinations to integrate, send notifications and share data between New Relic and your third-party systems.

## Message templates [#message-templates]

Configure the eventual notification events and map New Relic One data to your third-party services using message-templates.
