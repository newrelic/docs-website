<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="jira"
    title="Atlassian Jira"
  >
    **Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create, update and close Jira issues.**

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="vp5rigddko"
    />

    ## Permissions [#jira-permissions]
    <Callout variant="important">
    This integration does not support JIRA on-premises or data center installations. 
    </Callout>

    The required permissions from the Jira `API-Token` are `BROWSE_PROJECTS`, `ASSIGN_ISSUES`, `CLOSE_ISSUES`, `CREATE_ISSUES`, `EDIT_ISSUES`, `RESOLVE_ISSUES`, `TRANSITION_ISSUES`, `USER_PICKER`, and `ADD_COMMENTS`,

    To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira `API-Key` must have an `Admin` role.

    ## Set up a Jira destination [#set-up-jira]

    Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced.

    To create a Jira destination, enter the following information:

    * **Destination name:** Custom name to identify the destination.

    * **Jira account endpoint:** The URL of the destination.

    * **User-name:** The email address of the user.

    * **API token:** generated from your Atlassian account.

      Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the **Test connection** button.

      <img
        title="Jira destination configuration."
        alt="A screenshot of a Jira destination configuration."
        src={jiraDestination}
      />

      ### Two-way sync [#jira-two-way]

      Two-way sync is applicable for workflows. To enable it, turn on the **two-way integration** toggle.

      When turned on, a [Jira Webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) is created in your Jira account at a later stage for the selected project. The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and API key).

      #### Sync with NewRelic Workflows[#two-way-sync-workflows]

    * Closure of New Relic Issue is triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to done.

    * Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue is triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to in-progress.

      ## Configure the message template [#configure-jira-message-template]

      To configure a template for a Jira issue:

    1. Choose a destination. You can create a new destination at this stage.
    2. Upon successful connection to the destination, choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used.
    3. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance.

       To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields using the `X` mark on their right side.

       <img
         title="The Jira-specific custom variables menu."

    />

    ## Roles [#roles-servicenow]

    As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your ServiceNow incident table, and other optional values. We require the following permissions:

    * Full read permissions for the tables `sys_dictionary`, `sys_choice`, `sys_user`, and `task`.
    * Read/write permission to `incident`.
    * To fetch users for the `caller` column, we need read permissions for the `sys_user` table.

    The out-of-the-box non-granular roles `personalize_choices`, `personalize_dictionary`, `rest_service` or `snc_platform_rest_api_access`, and `itil` have the above permissions.
      
    <img
      src={serviceNowImage}
      title="ServiceNow out-of-the-box roles"
      alt="An image showing the ServiceNow out-of-the-box granular roles"
    />

    Read/write permissions to the `api_key_credentials` table are required to enable two-way integration. The roles `credentials_admin` and `discovery_admin` provide these.

    ## Set up a destination [#set-up-service-destination]

    To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information:

    * **Destination Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.

    * **Domain:** The URL of the destination.

    * **User-name:** The name of the user.

    * **Password:** The user's password.

      Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

      <img
        title="ServiceNow destination configuration."
        alt="A screenshot of a ServiceNow destination configuration."
        src={serviceNowDestination}
      />

      ### Two-way sync [#two-way-snow]

      To configure the two-way integration:

    1. Turn on the `two-way integration` toggle.

    2. Open and download this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/newrelic-notifications/snow-two-way-sync/Newrelic-Snow-Sync-Configurations.xml" download="NewRelic-SNow-Sync-Configurations.xml">XML file</a>, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic.

    3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rules**.

    4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select **Import XML** and upload the XML file you downloaded.

       Once the destination is saved, a New Relic API key is kept in `api_key_credentials`. The key is sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New Relic

       #### Sync with workflows[#two-way-sync-snow-workflows]

    * Closure of New Relic issue is triggered when the ServiceNow incident state changes to resolved.
    * Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue is triggered when the Servicnow incident state changes from open.

      ## Configure the message template [#configure-servicenow-message-template]

      Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance.

      To help you get started, the required and recommended fields are pre-populated with default values.

      When you add a custom value for a supported field, you can add a dynamic value from the issue payload or write your own value.

    You can remove any non-required field and add your own.

      <img
        title="ServiceNow incident template."
        alt="A screenshot of some recommended ServiceNow-incident fields and values."

    **Send notification messages to your Slack channels.**

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="3ypdkpd7zg"
    />

    ## Prerequisites [#slack-prereqs]

    - Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info) installed. The application must be approved by a workspace administrator before it can be individually installed by users.
    
    - Private channels need an invitation to install the New Relic application.

    ## Set up a Slack destination [#set-slack-destination]

    Click **one-click Slack authentication** to go to the Slack landing page, and continue the OAuth2 authentication process. If you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in.

    <img
      title="Create a Slack destination with a click."
      alt="A screenshot of the one-click Slack authentication."
      src={slackDestinationAuthentication}
    />

    Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace, and click **Continue**.

    <img
      title="add a slack workspace."
      alt="add a workspace."
      src={slackSignIn}
    />

    When signed in to the selected workspace, allow New Relic to perform the specified actions.

    <img
      title="select a workspace and configure permissions."
      alt="A screenshot permissions configurations."
      src={slackDestinationAllowAccess}
    />

    Click **Allow**, and return to the destination page.

    <img
      title="authentication completed successfully."
      alt="A screenshot completed authentication."
      src={slackAuthenticationCompleted}
    />

    ## Configure the Slack message settings [#configure-slack-message-settings]

    Select a destination (Workspace) and a slack channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated once to select private channels.

    <img
      title="Authenticate to select private channels."
      alt="Slack settings, user is not authenticated."
      src={slackMessageTemplateUserNotAuthenticated}
    />

    ### Send a test notification [#send-slack-test]

    You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected slack channel.

    <img
      title="Slack settings tested successfully."
      alt="A screenshot of the Slack settings."

    **Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like.**

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="feyutwgew8"
    />

    ## Set up a webhook destination [#set-webhook-destination]

    To create a webhook destination, you need the following:

    * **Destination Name:** A unique destination name.
    * **URL:** The endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed.
    * **Authorization mechanism (_Optional_):**. Can be `basic authentication` , `OAuth 2.0 `or a `bearer token`.

      ## Configure the webhook event template [#configure-webhook-event-template]

      Pick a webhook destination from the list, and configure the `HTTP-POST` request.

      The request configuration requires you to:

    1. Set a name for the template.
    2. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one.
    3. Add custom headers (optional).
    4. Configure the request's payload.

       ## Customize the webhook payload [#customize-webhook-payload]

       You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your webhook.

       Note that the request's content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to be a JSON. See [Usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples).

       The **Preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template.

       <img
         title="An invalid Json payload."
         alt="A screenshot of an invalid Json payload."
         src={webhookPreviewError}
       />

    <Callout variant="tip">
  Undefined type errors may indicate that the attribute wasn't indexed recently or doesn't exist. To fix the error, try adding an `if else` statement. For example, ` "closed_at": {{#if issueClosedAtUtc}} {{ json issueClosedAtUtc }} {{else}}"None"{{/if}} `
    </Callout>
    
       If the webhook payload conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination.

       <img
         title="A test webhook notification template."
         alt="A screenshot of a test webhook notification template."
         src={webhookNotificationTemplate}
       />

       We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly.

    ## Set up an email destination [#set-email-destination]

    You don't need to create email destinations manually. Destinations are created automatically when you configure an email destination.

    ## Configure the email settings [#configure-email-settings]

    Add one or more recipients.

    * Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address.
    * To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, enter their full email address.

      Every recipient will be translated into a destination. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the [notifications-log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/#notifications-log).

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="24mucmd1mj"
    />

## Set up an EventBridge destination [#set-up-eventbridge]
    
<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic is listed in AWS as a [SaaS Partner Event Source](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/integrations/).
</Callout>
    
To create an EventBridge destination, go to **Destinations** and click the **AWS EventBridge**, then enter the following information:

* **Name**: The destination name.
* **AWS region**: This is your AWS regional endpoint. Select the region where your event source is hosted.
* **AWS account ID**: Your AWS account ID. This is a 12-digit number.

## Choose your event source [#eventbridge-source]

Once you've configured your EventBridge destination with your AWS account ID, when you create a new event source, it's available in EventBridge.

1. Select or create a destination name.

2. Select or create an event source.

When you create a new event source, it's created in your AWS EventBridge account as an integration partner event source.

## Associate the event-source in your AWS account, and create a rule [#eventbridge-rule]

1. **Associate the event source with an event bus**.
In the AWS EventBridge console, choose Partner event sources in the navigation pane.

Select the button next to the partner event source and then choose Associate with event bus.

The status of the event source changes from Pending to Active, and the name of the event bus updates to match your event source name. You can now start creating rules that match events from New Relic.


2. **Create a rule for the event bus**.
To react to notifications sent from New Relic, you need to create rules with an event-pattern that filters-in New-Relic events. 
     <img
        title="Event pattern with the newrelic partner prefix."
        alt="A screenshot of rule Event pattern."
        src={eventBridgEventPattern}
      />

Use this AWS doc on how to [create an event source rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-saas.html#eb-create-rule-partner-events) for more detailed instructions.

## Configure the message event template [#message-eventbridge]

When you send notifications from New Relic to EventBridge, you can use a message template to customize that notification. Follow the steps to configure a message template for an EventBridge destination:

1. You can use the default template or customize your own.

If you want a customized template, choose variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your events.

The EventBridge API requires JSON. See our [JSON usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples). The template preview shows the rendered JSON.

Once the event template conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to AWS EventBridge.

    **Integrate New Relic with PagerDuty to automatically create, update, acknowledge and resolve PagerDuty incidents.**

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="lvzd77zj17"
    />

    We offer two ways to integrate with PagerDuty:

    * **[Account level integration using REST API Keys (recommended)](#pagerduty-ali)**: The integration is fully automatic and supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.

    * **[Service integration using Events API keys](#pagerduty-sli)**: The single service integration uses the service level integration key, and requires a separate New Relic destination for each unique PagerDuty service.

      # Account level integration [#pagerduty-ali]

      The integration is fully automatic and supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.

      ## Permissions [#pd-permissions]

      This integration requires permission to perform the following actions:

    * [List services](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE5Ng-list-services)

    * [Create an integration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIwMw-create-a-new-integration)

    * [Create a webhook subscription](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6MjkyNDc4NA-create-a-webhook-subscription)

    * [Create a note](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE1MA-create-a-note-on-an-incident)

    * [List teams](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIyMw-list-teams)

    * [List users](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIzMw-list-users)

      This integration requires a REST API Key. There are two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty:

    * [General access key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key): It includes all the above permission and can be obtained by PagerDuty Admins and Account Owners. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-general-access-rest-api-key).

    * [Personal user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key): If your account has advanced permissions, you can create unique personal REST API keys. Requests made using personal REST API keys are restricted to the user's permissions. If you choose to provide a user token API key, make sure it has the required permissions described above. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key).

      ## Set up a destination [#set-up-pagerduty]

      To create a PagerDuty destination, go to the integration method tab and enter the following information:

    * **Name**: Custom name to identify the destination.

    * **API Key**: For this integration, you will be asked to provide a REST API Key.

      There are two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty, [general access](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key) and [user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key).

      Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

      <img
        title="PagerDuty account-level destination configuration."
        alt="A screenshot of a PagerDuty account-level destination configuration."
        src={pagerDutyAccountDestination}
      />

      ### Two-way sync [#two-way-pagerduty]

      To enable two-way sync, turn on the **two-way integration** toggle.

      When turned on, a PagerDuty subscription is created at a later stage for the selected PagerDuty service (see [customize a message template](#message-pagerduty)). The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and New Relic API key).

      By default, any change of state to the PagerDuty incident created by New Relic will sync back to New Relic.
      <Callout variant="important">Please note that if you are a PagerDuty Event Intelligence or Digital Operations customer using Intelligent Alert Grouping on a given service, there could be a potential mismatch in PagerDuty Incidents sent back to New Relic.</Callout>

      #### Sync with New Relic workflows [#two-way-sync-workflows]

    * The closure of a New Relic issue is triggered when the PagerDuty incident is resolved.

    * The acknowledgment of a New Relic issue is triggered when the PagerDuty incident is acknowledged.

      ## Configure the message template [#message-pagerduty]

      To configure the message template:

    1. Choose a destination. You can create a new destination at this stage.

    2. Select a PagerDuty service.

    3. Select a user. New Relic will post notes in behalf of selected user.

       Note that custom details in PagerDuty Alerts is automatically populated.
