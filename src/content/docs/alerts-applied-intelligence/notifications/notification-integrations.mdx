  ## Permissions [#jira-permissions]

  The required permissions from the Jira `API-Token` are `create`, `edit`, and `close` tickets.

  To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira `API-Key` should have an `Admin` role.

  ## Set up a Jira destination [#set-up-jira]

  Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced.

  To create a Jira destination, enter the following information:
  * **Destination name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **Jira account endpoint:** The URL of the destination.
  * **User-name:** The email address of the user making the connection.
  * **API token:** generated from your Atlassian account.

  <Callout variant="important">
    New Relic currently supports [Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-team-managed-and-company-managed-projects/). 
  </Callout>

  Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the **test connection** button.

  ![A screenshot of a Jira destination configuration.](./images/jira_destination.png "Jira destination configuration.")

  <figcaption>Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving.</figcaption>

  ### Two-way sync [#jira-two-way]

  You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the two-way integration toggle.

  When turned on, a [Jira Webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) is created in your Jira account at a later stage for the selected project. The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and API key).

  ## Configure the message template [#configure-jira-message-template]

  To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. 

  Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. 

  Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. 

  To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. 

  Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the `X` mark on their right side)

  ![A screenshot of the Jira-specific custom variables menu.](./images/jira-template.png "The Jira-specific custom variables menu.")

  <figcaption>Jira message template.</figcaption>

  ## Send a test notification [#send-jira-test]

  You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values.

  If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear.

  ## Roles [#roles-servicenow]

  As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values.  
  For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: `sys_dictionary`, `sys_choice`, `sys_user` and `task`. A read/write permission to `incident`
  To be able to fetch users for the `caller` column, we required read permissions for the `sys_users` table.

  The above permissions can be achieved with the roles `personalize_choices`, `personalize_dictionary`, `rest_service`, `itil`. 

  Read/Write permissions to the `api_key_credentials` table is required to enable two-way integration.

  This can be covered with the roles `credentials_admin` and `discovery_admin`. 

  ## Set up a destination [#set-up-service-destination]

  To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information:

  * **Destination Name:** custom name to identify the destination
  * **Domain:** the URL of the destination
  * **User-name:**  the name of the user
  * **Password:**  the user name's password 

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **test connection** button.

  ![A screenshot of a ServiceNow destination configuration.](./images/serviceNow_destination.png "ServiceNow destination configuration.")

  ### Two-way sync [#two-way-servicenow]

  You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic.

  To configure the two-way integration:

  1. Turn on the `two-way integration` toggle. 

  2. Open and download this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/newrelic-notifications/snow-two-way-sync/Newrelic-Snow-Sync-Configurations.xml" download="NewRelic-SNow-Sync-Configurations.xml">XML file</a>, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One.

  3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rules**.

  4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select **Import XML** and upload the XML file you downloaded.

  Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the `api_key_credentials`. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic

  ## Configure the message template [#configure-servicenow-message-template]

  Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. 

  To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. 

  Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the `X` mark on their right side)

  ![A screenshot of some recommended ServiceNow-incident fields and values.](./images/serviceNow_message-template.png "ServiceNow incident template.")

  <figcaption>Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template.</figcaption>

  ## Send a test notification [#send-servicenow-test]

  Click on **Test notification** to see ServiceNow incidents with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created, and a link will appear.

  ## Prerequisites [#slack-prereqs]

  Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info) installed.

  The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users

  ## Set up a Slack destination [#set-slack-destination]

  Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process.
  
  ![A screenshot of the one-click Slack authentication.](./images/slack_destination-authentication.png "Create a Slack destination with a click.")

  On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in.

  Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click **Continue**.
  
  ![add a workspace.](./images/slack-sign-in.png "add a slack workspace.")

  When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions.
  
  ![A screenshot permissions configurations.](./images/slack_destination_allow_access.png "select a workspace and configure permissions.")

  Clicking *Allow** will redirect you back to the destination page.

  ![A screenshot completed authentication.](./images/slack_authentication_completed.png "authentication completed successfully.")

  ## Configure the Slack message settings [#configure-slack-message-settings]

  Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent.
  You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace.
  Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process)

  ![Slack settings, user is not authenticated.](./images/slack_message-template-user-not-authenticated.png "Authenticate to select private channels.")

  ### Send a test notification [#send-slack-test]

  You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel.

/>       
      
  ## Set up a webhook destination [#set-webhook-destination]

  To create a webhook destination, you need the following:

  * **Destination Name:** A unique destination name
  * **URL:** the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed.
  * **Authorization mechanism (*Optional*):**. Can be `basic authentication` or a `bearer token`

  ## Configure the webhook event template [#configure-webhook-event-template]

  Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the `HTTP-POST` request. 

  The request configuration requires you to:

  1. Set a name for the template.
  2. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one.
  3. Add custom headers (optional).
  4. Configure the request's payload.

  ## Customize the webhook payload [#customize-webhook-payload]

  You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your webhook.

  Note that the request's content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to be a JSON. See [Usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples). 

  The **Preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template. 

  ![A screenshot of an invalid Json payload.](./images/webhook-preview-error.png "An invalid Json payload.")

  If the webhook payload conforms a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination. 

  ![A screenshot of a test webhook notification template.](./images/webhook-notification-template.png "A test webhook notification template.")

  We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly.

  **Integrate New Relic with PagerDuty to automatically create and update incidents, and notify on-call responders based on issues sent from New Relic.**

  ## Integrate PagerDuty [#pagerduty-integrate]
      
  New Relic offers two ways to integrate with PagerDuty:

  * **[Account level integration using REST API Keys (recommended)](#pagerduty-ali)**:This integration supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.
  * **[Service level integration using EVENTS API keys](#pagerduty-sli)**: This single service integration uses the service level integration key, and requires a separate New Relic destination for each unique PagerDuty service.

  ### Account level integration (recommended) [#pagerduty-ali]
    
  This integration requires permission to perform the following actions:

   * [List services](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE5Ng-list-services)
   * [Create an integration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIwMw-create-a-new-integration)
   * [Create a webhook subscription](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6MjkyNDc4NA-create-a-webhook-subscription)
   * [Create a note](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE1MA-create-a-note-on-an-incident)
   * [List teams](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIyMw-list-teams)
   * [List users](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIzMw-list-users)
            
  This integration requires a REST API Key. There are two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty:

    * [General access key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key): It includes all the above permission and can be obtained by PagerDuty Admins and Account Owners. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-general-access-rest-api-key).
    * [Personal user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key): If your account has advanced permissions, you can create unique personal REST API keys. Requests made using personal REST API keys are restricted to the user's permissions. If you choose to provide a user token API key, make sure it has the required permissions described above.[See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key).

  ### Service level integration [#pagerduty-sli]
    
  The Events API is available to all customers, and any user with a manager role or above can generate an integration key. [See the PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#events-api-keys)).

  ## Set up a destination  [#set-up-pagerduty]

  To create a PagerDuty destination, go to the integration method tab and enter the following information: 
  
  * **Name**: Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **API Key**: For account level integrations, paste the [General](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key) or [Personal](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key)) API key from PagerDuty, or paste the service level integration key.

  ### Two-way integration sync [two-way-pagerduty]

  If you're using the account level integration, configure a two-way integration with PagerDuty incidents so that when state for the incident (acknowledged/resolved) updates, the corresponding New Relic issue state is also updated (acknowledged/closed).

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.
    
  ## Configure the message template [#message-pagerduty]

  To configure the message template: 

  * Select the PagerDuty destination you'd like to notify.
  * For account integrations using API Key:
    * Upon successful connection, your PagerDuty services are fetched from your account.
    * Select the PagerDuty service you'd like to integrate.
    * Choose a user that will post the notes in PagerDuty. Personal API is limited to the user that has generated the API Key).
  * Customize the summary received in PagerDuty.
  * The custom details section in PagerDuty is automatically populated with predefined values from the New Relic issue.
    
  ## Send a test notification [#test-notification-pagerduty]

  You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload from the channel. This will create an incident in PagerDuty.
