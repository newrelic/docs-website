Alerts and applied intelligence notification integrations allow you to connect specific services and platforms to the New Relic platform. You can use these connections to send notifications from New Relic. Through these notifications you get information about issues that need a review or that help you to take a decision about a detected problem.

## Integration details [#detail]

    />

  ### Permissions [#jira-permissions]
  <Callout variant="important">
    This integration doesn't support JIRA on-premises or data center installations. 
  </Callout>

  The required permissions from the Jira `API-Token` are `BROWSE_PROJECTS`, `ASSIGN_ISSUES`, `CLOSE_ISSUES`, `CREATE_ISSUES`, `EDIT_ISSUES`, `RESOLVE_ISSUES`, `TRANSITION_ISSUES`, `USER_PICKER`, and `ADD_COMMENTS`.

  To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira `API-Key` must have an `Admin` role.

  ### Set up a Jira destination [#set-up-jira]

  Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates, and stay synced.

  To create a Jira destination follow these steps:
    
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **Jira**.
    2. Enter the following information:

        * **Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
        * **URL:** The URL of the destination.
        * **Username:** The email address of the user.
        * **API token:** generated from your Atlassian account.


  Before saving the destination, we recommend you click the **Test connection** button to check your connection.

      width="80%;"
      title="Jira destination configuration."
      alt="A screenshot of a Jira destination configuration."
      src={accountsJiraDestination}
      />


 ### Two-way sync [#jira-two-way]

Two-way sync is applicable for workflows. To enable it, turn on the two-way integration toggle.

When turned on, a [Jira Webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) is created in your Jira account. The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and API key).

### Sync with New Relic workflows [#two-way-sync-workflows]

  * Closure of a New Relic issue triggers when the Jira issue status changes to `done`.
  * Acknowledgment of New Relic issue triggers when the Jira issue status changes to `in-progress`.

### Configure the message template in Workflows [#configure-jira-message-template]

To configure a template for a Jira issue follow these steps:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Workflows** and click on an existing workflow, or click the **+ Add a new workflow** button.
    2. Choose an existing destination or create a new one.
    3. Once you've connected to the destination, choose a project, then select the Jira issue type to use.
    4. After selecting the issue type, the configured project's fields automatically map to your Jira instance.
  
To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Ensure that you've included a value in all required fields before proceeding.


### Send a test notification [#send-jira-test]

Click a test notification with default field values to see the Jira issue. If successful, you'll have a link to view the incident in Jira.

  ### Set up an EventBridge destination [#set-up-eventbridge]
    
  <Callout variant="important">
    New Relic is listed in AWS as a [SaaS Partner Event Source](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/integrations/).
  </Callout>

  To create an AWS EventBridge destination follow these steps:
    
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **AWS EventBridge**.

    2. Enter the following information:

        * **Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.

        * **AWS region:** This is your AWS regional endpoint. Select the region where your event source is hosted.

        * **AWS account ID:** Your AWS account ID. This is a 12-digit number.

  <img
    width="80%;"
    title="AWS EventBridge destination"
    alt="AWS EventBridge destination"
    src={accountsAWSEventBridgeDestination}
    />


  ### Choose your event source [#eventbridge-source]

  Once you've configured your EventBridge destination with your AWS account ID, when you create a new event source, it's available in EventBridge.

    1. Select or create a destination name.

    2. Select or create an event source.

  
  When you create a new event source, it's created in your AWS EventBridge account as an integration partner event source.


  ### Associate the event-source in your AWS account, and create a rule [#eventbridge-rule]

    To associate the event source with an event bus:

    1. In the AWS EventBridge console, choose **Partner event sources** in the navigation pane.

    2. Select the button next to the partner event source and then choose **Associate with event bus**.

      The status of the event source changes from **Pending** to **Active**, and the name of the event bus updates to match your event source name. You can now start creating rules that match events from New Relic.

    3. Create a rule for the event bus.

      To react to notifications sent from New Relic, you need to create rules with an event-pattern that filters-in New-Relic events.

     <img
        width="80%;"
        title="Event pattern with the newrelic partner prefix."
        alt="A screenshot of rule Event pattern."
        src={accountsBridgeEventPattern}
      />

    Use this AWS doc on how to [create an event source rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-saas.html#eb-create-rule-partner-events) for more detailed instructions.


  ### Configure the message event template in workflows [#message-eventbridge]

    Navigate to **Workflows**, click on an existing workflow or the **Add a new Workflow** button, and choose the EventBridge destination.
    When you send notifications from New Relic to EventBridge, you can use a message template to customize that notification.

    You can use the default template or customize your own. Choose **Variables** from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your events.

    The EventBridge API requires JSON, and the template preview displays the rendered JSON. Once the event template conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to AWS EventBridge. See our [JSON usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples) for more information.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="email"
    title="Email"
  >
  
  The email destination is created automatically when you choose **Email** as the notification channel for a [workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/), so you don't need to configure that from the **Destinations** menu. Each email destination is unique to the workflow associated with it, and this means that it may appear as a duplicate in the destinations feed.

  To send an email notification:

  1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**.
  2. Select **Workflows** on the left navigation panel.
  3. Click **+ Add a workflow**.

    <img
      width="80%;"
      title="Configure your workflow"
      alt="Configure your workflow"
      src={accountsEmailConfWorkflow}
    />
    
  4. Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique.
  5. Filter the data you need. You can choose between **Basic** and **Advanced** options to add the issues you want to send.
  6. Click **Additional settings** to enrich your data. Enable **Enrich your data** to build a NRQL query.
  7. Click **Save and exit**.
  8. Select **Email** as notification method.
    
    <img
    width="60%;"
    title="Email settings"
    alt="A screenshot of the email settings."
    src={accountsEmailSettings}
    />
    
  9. Add the emails you want to send notifications to. You can add one or more recipients.

      * You can find users with New Relic accounts by searching for their email address.
      * To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, enter their full email address.
      * Each list of email addresses added to the email settings will create its own unique destination, which will appear in the destination feed.
      * When you create a destination with an email address already associated with an existing destination, a prompt will appear offering the option to merge the two. Selecting **Merge** will combine the destinations, ensuring notifications are efficiently routed to the intended recipient.
      * You can follow the email notifications per destination in the [notifications log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/#notifications-log).
    
  10. Customize the email message.
    
      * For the email subject, you can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. 
      * The email body includes default data that can't be changed but you can also add your own customized additional details. These customizations appear under the **Custom Details** section.
      * To enrich the email, pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax).

  11. Click **Send test notification** to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.
  12. Click **Save**.
  13. Click **Activate workflow**.


  From the Workflow main page, you can enable, edit, delete, or copy workflow id to clipboard the created workflow.

  Integrate New Relic with PagerDuty to automatically create, update, acknowledge, and resolve PagerDuty incidents.

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="lvzd77zj17"
    />

  We offer two ways to integrate with PagerDuty:

  * **[Account level integration using REST API Keys (recommended)](#pagerduty-ali)**: This fully automatic integration supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.
  * **[Service integration using Events API keys](#pagerduty-sli)**: This single service integration uses the service level integration key, and requires a separate New Relic destination for each unique PagerDuty service.


  ### Account level integration [#pagerduty-ali]

  This fully automatic integration supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.

  ### Permissions [#pd-permissions]

  This integration requires permission to perform the following actions:

    * [List services](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE5Ng-list-services)
    * [Create an integration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIwMw-create-a-new-integration)
    * [Create a webhook subscription](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6MjkyNDc4NA-create-a-webhook-subscription)
    * [Create a note](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE1MA-create-a-note-on-an-incident)
    * [List teams](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIyMw-list-teams)
    * [List users](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIzMw-list-users)

  This integration requires a REST API Key. PagerDuty has two types of REST API keys:
    * [General access key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key): It includes all the permissions listed above and PagerDuty admins and account owners have access. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-general-access-rest-api-key).
    * [Personal user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key): If your account has advanced permissions, you can create unique personal REST API keys. Requests made using personal REST API keys are restricted to the user's permissions. If you choose to provide a user token API key, make sure it has the required permissions described above. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key).
    
  <Callout variant="tip">
      For personal user tokens, we recommend you use a dedicated integration user that does not belong to a real user.
  </Callout>


  ### Set up a destination [#set-up-pagerduty]

  To create a PagerDuty destination:
    
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **PagerDuty**.
    2. Enter the following information:

        * **Name**: Custom name to identify the destination.
        * **API Key**: For this integration, you will be asked to provide a REST API Key. There're two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty, [general access](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key) and [user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key).

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

        title="PagerDuty account-level destination configuration"
        alt="A screenshot of a PagerDuty account-level destination configuration"
        src={accountsPagerDutyAccountDestinationNewUi}
      />


  ### Two-way sync [#two-way-pagerduty]

  To enable two-way sync, turn on the **two-way integration** toggle. When turned on, a PagerDuty subscription is created at a later stage for the selected PagerDuty service (see [customize a message template](#message-pagerduty)). The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and New Relic API key). By default, any change of state to the PagerDuty incident created by New Relic will sync back to New Relic.

  <Callout variant="important">
    If you're a PagerDuty Event Intelligence or Digital Operations customer using Intelligent Alert Grouping on a given service, potential mismatches in PagerDuty incidents sent back to New Relic may occur.
  </Callout>


  ### Sync with New Relic workflows [#two-way-sync-workflows]

  * The closure of a New Relic issue is triggered when the PagerDuty incident is resolved.
  * The acknowledgment of a New Relic issue is triggered when the PagerDuty incident is acknowledged.

  ### Configure the message template in workflows [#message-pagerduty]

  To configure the message template:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Workflows** and click on an existing workflow, or the **+ Add a new workflow** button and choose the PagerDuty notifier.
    2. Choose a destination, or create a new one.
    3. Select a PagerDuty service.
    4. Select a user. New Relic will post notes in behalf of selected user.  
    5. Send details to the Custom Details section in Pagerduty. You can use the default payload or customize it using free text or dynamic variables from the issue payload. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your payload. The **preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template.

Custom details in PagerDuty alerts are automatically populated.

  ### Send a test notification [#test-notification-pagerduty]

  You can see how the PagerDuty incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear.

    />

    ### Roles [#roles-servicenow]

    As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your ServiceNow incident table, and other optional values. We require the following permissions:

     * Full read permissions for the tables `sys_dictionary`, `sys_choice`, `sys_user`, and `task`.
     * Read/write permission to `incident`.
     * To fetch users for the `caller` column, we need read permissions for the `sys_user` table.

    The out-of-the-box non-granular roles `personalize_choices`, `personalize_dictionary`, `rest_service` or `snc_platform_rest_api_access`, and `itil` have the above permissions. Read/write permissions to the `api_key_credentials` table are required to enable two-way integration. The roles `credentials_admin` and `discovery_admin` provide these.


  ### Set up a destination [#set-up-service-destination]

  To create a ServiceNow destination:

   1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **ServiceNow**.
   2. Enter the following information:

        * **Destination Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
        * **Domain:** The URL of the destination.
        * **Username:** The name of the user.
        * **Password:** The user's password.

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

  ### Two-way sync [#two-way-snow]

  To configure the **two-way integration**:

      1. Turn on the `two-way integration` toggle.
      2. Open and download this [XML file](https://storage.googleapis.com/newrelic-notifications/snow-two-way-sync/Newrelic-Snow-Sync-Configurations.xml), which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic.

      3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rules**.
      4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select **Import XML**, and upload the XML file you downloaded.

  Once you save the destination, a New Relic API key is kept in `api_key_credentials`. The key is sent in a header as part of the REST callback call to New Relic.

  ### Sync with workflows [#two-way-sync-snow-workflows]

      * When the ServiceNow incident state changes to resolved triggers the closure of New Relic issue.
      * When the ServiceNow incident state changes from open triggers the acknowledgment of New Relic issue.


  ### Configure the message template in workflows [#configure-servicenow-message-template]

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Workflows** and click on an existing workflow, or the **+ Add a new workflow** button
    2. Choose a ServiceNow destination.
    3. Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance.

  To help you get started, the required and recommended fields are pre-populated with default values. When you add a custom value for a supported field, you can add a dynamic value from the issue payload or write your own value. You can remove any non-required field and add your own.

### Send a test notification [#send-servicenow-test]

  Click **Send test notification** to see ServiceNow incidents with default field values. If successful, you'll see a link with the created incident.

  The certified ServiceNow integration with New Relic workflows is available in the ServiceNow store. When using ServiceNow, remember the following:

  * The ServiceNow instance stores the New Relic issue notifications as `New Relic Issues`.
  * You can configure routing policies in ServiceNow to generate tasks or other records to represent or correspond to those issues when they match a given policy.
  * The acknowledgment or closure events in ServiceNow can acknowledge or close the issue in New Relic.
  * You can automatically convert New Relic issues to actionable tasks in ServiceNow.
  * ServiceNow can receive updates from New Relic on issues.
  * The policy engine allows the qualification of New Relic alerts as they come in.
  * Match entities to configuration items and relate them to the task table available.
  * From ServiceNow you can send and see as images the New Relic enrichments.

  You can integrate ServiceNow with New Relic by either using the ServiceNow application destination or using the webhook destination.

  ### Prerequisites [#slack-prereqs]

  Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info)(or the [EU App](https://slack.com/apps/AS5D75HQQ-new-relic-eu?tab=more_info) for `one.eu.newrelic` customers) installed. A workspace administrator must approve the application before you can individually install it. If you need assistance, contact support@newrelic.com.

  ### Set up a Slack destination [#set-slack-destination]

  1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **Slack**.
  2. Click the **Authenticate in one click** button to go to the Slack landing page, and continue the OAuth2 authentication process. If you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in.

    <img
      width="60%;"
      title="Create a Slack destination with a click."
      alt="A screenshot of the one-click Slack authentication."
      src={accountsSlackDestinationAuthentication}
    />

  3. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace, and click **Continue**.

    <img
      width="50%;"
      title="add a Slack workspace."
      alt="add a workspace."
      src={accountsSlackSignIn}
    />

  4. When signed in to the selected workspace, allow New Relic to perform the specified actions.

    <img
      width="40%;"
      title="select a workspace and configure permissions."
      alt="A screenshot permissions configurations."
      src={accountsSlackDestinationAllowAccess}

      width="80%;"
      title="authentication completed successfully."
      alt="A screenshot completed authentication."
      src={accountsSlackAuthenticationCompleted}
    />
  
### Configure the Slack message template in workflows [#configure-slack-message-settings]

  1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Workflows** and click on an existing workflow, or the **+ Add a workflow** button.
  2. Select a destination (Workspace) and a Slack channel to send messages. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. For privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated once to select private channels. When selecting a private channel, the bot will automatically be added to the channel.
  3. You can use the default notification or enrich it with custom details. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your payload.
  4. Click the **Send test notification** button to send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack channel.

    <img
      width="80%;"
      title="Authenticate to select private channels."

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"

You should use a webhook notifier in workflows to send notification messages to a specified HTTPS endpoint. By default, the notifier assumes that the content type of the request is JSON and makes an HTTP POST request to the given endpoint. When you start configuring it, the webhook notifier provides a default JSON payload structure that you can use out of the box. However, if you require more customization, you can modify the payload using Handlebars template syntax. This allows you to populate variables within the payload dynamically, tailoring it to your specific needs.

In addition to the payload, you also have the ability to include additional HTTP headers in the webhook request. This can be useful for passing extra information or authentication tokens to the receiving endpoint. Here is a video tutorial for setting up webhooks.

    <Video
      type="wistia"
      id="feyutwgew8"
    />

  ### Set up a webhook destination [#set-webhook-destination]

  To create a webhook destination follow these steps:

  1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, click **Destinations**, and then select **Webhook**.
  2. Enter the following information: 

     * **Webhook name:** Reference name for your webhook.
     * **Endpoint URL:** The endpoint of the target application where an HTTP POST request will be sent. 
     * **Use authorization:** (Optional) You can choose between `Basic Authentication`, `OAuth 2.0`, or `Bearer Token`.
  
  <img
      width="80%;"
      title="Webhook destination configuration"
      alt="Webhook destination configuration"
      src={accountsWebhookDestination}
    />

If you're new to working with webhooks and want to test the configuration and examine webhook payloads without writing a service, you can use HTTP catch-all services. [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com) and [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) are examples of services that give you a designated URL where you can receive HTTP payloads and then inspect the JSON payload of the event. This feature is valuable for gathering relevant information before starting your development process.

If you're building a new service to consume this payload you must test it locally. Using local tunnels is a good idea for testing and debugging webhooks in a local environment before deploying to a production server. These tunnels allow you to receive incoming webhook requests from New Relic on your local machine, eliminating the need for a publicly accessible server during development. Tools like Beeceptor or ngrok enable you to create a temporary public URL that forwards requests to your local server by specifying the desired application port or address. This expedites iteration and debugging, as you can directly observe and analyze webhook payloads in your local development environment.

### Two-way sync [#two-way-webhook]

For notifications sent from workflows, you can acknowledge or close issues using [Nerdgraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-issues-api-via-github/#resolve-ack-issues). When testing two-way sync with webhooks, you can use Beeceptor's customized response status and payload templates. This allows you to draft a desired response when acknowledging the received events.

### Configure the webhook event template [#configure-webhook-event-template]

Pick a webhook destination from the list, and configure the `HTTP-POST` request.

The request configuration requires you to:

1. Set a name for the template.
2. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one.
3. Add custom headers (optional).
4. Configure the request's payload.


### Customize the webhook payload in workflows [#customize-webhook-payload]
    
Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Workflows** and click on an existing workflow, or the **+ Add a new workflow** button and select a Webhook destination.
       
    <Callout variant="important">
      The request's content-type is JSON by default, so the payload needs to be in JSON format too. To get familiar with the format, see [our usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples). 
    </Callout>
    
You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your webhook. The **Preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, there'll be an error and you couldn't save the template.

       <img
         width="80%;"
         title="An invalid Json payload."
         alt="A screenshot of an invalid Json payload."
         src={accountsWebhookPreviewError}
       />

  <Callout variant="tip">
    Undefined type errors may indicate that the attribute wasn't indexed recently or doesn't exist. To fix the error, try adding an `if else` statement. For example, `"closed_at": {{#if issueClosedAtUtc}} {{ json issueClosedAtUtc }} {{else}}"None"{{/if}}`
  </Callout>
    
  If the webhook payload conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination. We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly. 

       <img
         width="80%;"
