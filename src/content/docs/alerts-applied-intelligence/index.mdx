Together, New Relic Alerts and Applied intelligence form a flexible and centralized notification system that unlocks the operational potential of New Relic. Alerts is a single tool to manage alert policies and alert conditions, letting you focus on the metrics you care about most.

Applied intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems faster. Specifically, it's a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies.
