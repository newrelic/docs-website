Over the course of several months during 2022 and 2023, new functionalities in our platform will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition.

If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to:

* Reach out to your New Relic account representative.
* Use the reply thread in our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/big-news-for-alerts-and-applied-intelligence/161436).

## What's changed [#changed]

Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there.

Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the **Analyze** category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies.

We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months.

    ## Analyze [#analyze]

    Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies.

    The [overview page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page) shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations.

    The **Issues & activity** page shows your most recent [issues](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#issues), [incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#incidents), and [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#anomalies).

    ## Detect [#detect]

    Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected.

    The [alert conditions (policies) page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here.

    The [anomaly detection page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/expanded-anomaly-detection/) lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here.

    ## Correlate [#correlate]

    Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together.

    The [sources page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources) shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty.

    The [decisions page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/) shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions.

    ## Enrich & notify [#enrich]

    Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent.

    Use the [muting rules page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications.

    Use [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to add more data to your alerts notifications.

    Use [destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#2-configure-destinations) to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent.

    Use [pathways](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#3-configure-pathways) to configure where your correlated issues get sent.

    Use [incident workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies.

    Use [incident destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/) to add and configure third-party services for your incidents.

    ## Settings [#settings]

    Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage.

    ## Alerts (classic) [#alerts]

    Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using.

    Use the [events and incidents pages](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents/) to review alerts violations and other events.

    Use the [channels page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/) for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels.

## What's changing [#changes]

Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022 and 2023, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="outlier"
    title="March 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types."
  >
    **Reason for EOL:** [Outlier conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/outlier-detection-nrql-alert/) don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities.

    **Replacement:** Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition.

    **Learn more:**

    * [Faceted baseline conditions documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/other-condition-types/create-baseline-alert-conditions/#baseline-facets)
    * [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/nrql-outlier-alert-conditions-end-of-life/164167)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="incident-response"
    title="2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic to replace classic incident response workflow."
  >
    **Reason for EOL:** The classic [incident response workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/specify-when-alerts-create-incidents/) involves the **Incident** and **Violation details** pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations.

    **Replacement:** We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic.

    **Learn more:**

    * Additional documentation will be provided.
    * [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/big-news-for-alerts-and-applied-intelligence/161436)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="notifications"
    title="1st half of 2023: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies."
  >
    **Reason for EOL:** The [current alerting setup process](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation.

    **Replacement:** Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace [current notification channel options](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/). This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels.

    **Learn more:**

    * Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="condition-types"
    title="2nd half of 2023: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types."
  >
    **Reason for EOL:** Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our [many types of alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities.

    **Replacement:** This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/) instead of other types.

    **Learn more:**

    * Additional documentation will be provided.
