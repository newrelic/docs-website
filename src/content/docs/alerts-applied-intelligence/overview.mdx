As the digital world continues to grow more tangled and complex, it's easy for DevOps teams to feel overwhelmed. There are so many new data points, dashboards, entities, and alerts that it can be hard for on-call teams to know what's happening, where it's happening, and what to do about it. New Relic's alerts and applied intelligence were designed to end response fatigue so your team can not only detect and diagnose incidents, but prioritize them for immediate action.

Alerts allow you to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, letting you focus on the things you care about most. Applied intelligence is a machine-learning engine that notifies your team about potential problems by identifying anomalous behavior, correlating any relevant incidents, alerting your team of active issues, and providing a root cause analysis.

Alerts and applied intelligence were created for busy DevOps teams: they reduce noise and make sure you never miss an issue. 

## How it all works 

Alerts and applied intelligence are a suite of tools and features that proactively notify you when things go wrong right when the problems begin.

### Detect and diagnose potential problems in your system [#detect-intro]

New Relic never stops observing your telemetry data and we created alerts so your team can decide when you want to be notified and how.  

Let's say you want to monitor latency for your most recent deployment, you can set a static alert condition that will create an incident if behavior deviates beyond the threshold that you set. This means that no matter what, your team will be notified if latency exceeds your static threshold. Static alerts are dependable and completely customizable for your specific needs.

Anomalies take alerting one step further and use machine learning to monitor patterns and trends in your data. Anomalies identify any deviation from expected behavior and notify your team instantly. You can decide what level of anomaly works best for each situation. Our automatic anomaly detection is easy to use and implement, while customizable anomaly detection offers your team the ability to create alerts that are just right for you. 

Learn how to create static [alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) and how to configure anomalies [in our anomaly docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence). 

We also have self-adjusting monitoring which uses [anomaly alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-anomaly-alert-conditions) to allow you to create intelligent, self-adjusting conditions.

### Correlate relevant issues to reduce noise [#correlation-intro]

After you've detected any irregular behavior in your system, applied intelligence's correlation logic reviews all incoming events and compares them based on signals like time, context, or source. If multiple issues are discovered to be related, instead of creating many, redundant alerts, applied intelligence's correlation logic will group these issues together to create a single, relevant alert. This saves your team time and energy and allows you to get to the heart of the problem faster. 

Our correlation logic is called decisions. To learn how to set up decisions, follow our step by step guide by [in our decisions docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/).

### Notify the right people at the right time [#workflow-intro]

Once you've used our anomaly detection to identify irregular behavior and correlation logic to group all your relevant issues together, it's important to notify the right people on your team of any potential problems. New Relic created workflows so you can control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues which allow you to funnel the right information to the relevant person or team. Workflows also give you the opportunity to enrich your notifications with additional New Relic data.

To learn how to set up workflows, follow our step by step guide by [in our workflows docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows).

If you still have access to pathways, reach out to your New Relic account representative and ask to be upgraded.

### Tell us where to send your alerts [#destinations]

After you've created a workflow that connects your team with the information they need,  you need to configure your destinations. Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use. Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.

To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, [explore our notification documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/).

## Navigate the alerts and applied intelligence UI [#get-started-with-alerts]

In the New Relic UI, alerts and applied intelligence are divided into several sections, each unlocking different features. Check out the section explanations below to learn how these features can meet your needs.

### Analyze your issues, incidents, and anomalies [#analyze]

Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts incidents, issues, and anomalies.

* **[Overview](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page)**: Find your most recent open, closed, and muted incidents.
* **Issues & activity**: Review your most recent [issues](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#issues), [incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#incidents), and [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#anomalies).

### Detect problems in your system [#detect]

Define problems in your system you want to be notified about with alert conditions.

* **[Alert policies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/)**: Create new policies to group related conditions together. Also, list the policies where your conditions are created and organized.

### Correlate the data coming into your system [#correlate]

Use the correlate features to define your data sources and to review and configure the logic that groups your incidents.

* **[Sources](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions#configure-sources)**: Manage the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones.
* **[Decisions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions)**: Review your correlated incidents and make decisions on how to respond to them. You can also review, edit, and add decisions.

### Enrich your notifications with useful metadata [#enrich]

Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent.

* **[Muting rules](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/)**: Temporarily stop your alerts notifications.
* **[Workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/)**: Add more data to your notifications.
* **[Destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations)**: Configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent.

### Use Settings to review and manage your usage [#settings]

Use the general settings page to review and manage your current applied intelligence configuration.

### Use our API's to interact with alerts

* **Use our GraphQL [NerdGraph API](/docs/alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-examples/nerdgraph-api-examples)** to interact with alerts. We recommend the NerdGraph API over the REST API because it has the latest features.

* **Use the [REST API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts)** to return information about your alert settings or to create alert policies and conditions. We recommend you start with the NerdGraph API to see if it has the options you need.

### Note about EU/US datacenters [#eu-datacenter]

New Relic's incident intelligence service is performed solely in the United States. By using New Relic incident intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center). If you elect to use the suggested responder feature and manage EU-based individuals, you may need to confirm that an appropriate data processing agreement is in place.
