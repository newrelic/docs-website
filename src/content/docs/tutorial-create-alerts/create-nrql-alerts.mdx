While using charts is a great way to create alert conditions from premade queries, sometimes you need to create alert conditions from scratch. The process for creating a new alert from a NRQL query is almost the exact same as creating it from a chart: the key difference is that you write the NRQL query manually instead of using a pre-generated one.

NRQL stands for New Relic's Query Language—a standardized query method that powers all our charts, and which you can use to analyze and query your data. If this is your first time working with NRQL, you may want to check out our [NRQL docs](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to learn more about NRQL, including [how it works](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/) and an [introductory tutorial](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-tutorial/).

## Create an alert

/>

1. From **one.newrelic.com**, select [**Alerts & AI**](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai), then [**Alert conditions (policies)**](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/alerts-classic/policies).

2. Select **New alert condition**.

3. Write the NRQL query to create the condition. For example, if you wanted to monitor slow transactions, you can enter:
```sql
SELECT average(duration) from Transaction facet name
```

4. Select **Next** once you've finished to save your progress and move on to the next step.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Adjust the signal behavior

1. **Set the data aggregation options**:
    * **Window duration**: Use the **Window duration** setting to determine how frequently we aggregate your data, such as groupings of every 5 minutes or every hour. This feature's setting depends on what kind of data you're monitoring. If you're unsure of what it should be, you can leave it at the default setting.
    * **Sliding window aggregation**: Choose whether or not you want to use [sliding window aggregation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#sliding-window-aggregation). This feature creates smoother charts when dealing with erratic data by creating overlapping aggregation windows. This feature is disabled by default, and we recommend keeping it disabled for your first alert
    * **Streaming method**: The options most commonly used are **Event flow** and **Event timer**. **Event flow** is best suited for frequent and consistently reporting data, while **Event timer** is best suited for data that reports inconsisntely, infrequently, or ingests in batches. If you want to learn more about the individual settings to see which method should be used in each scenario, see [our docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#aggregation-methods)

2. **Set the timing option**: This determines how long we wait for events in each window before we evaluate them. A longer delay will mean fewer false alerts, but it will also mean longer potential downtime before an incident is open. This capability is also shown differently depending on the option you select: it's called **Delay** in the **Event flow** and **Cadence** options and **Timer** in **Event timer**. For your first alert, we recommend keeping the default time setting.

3. **Select the gap filling strategy**: Gap-filling is a reactive feature that fills blank periods in data reporting with user-defined synthetic value. If you believe the data reporting will be sporadic, you can avoid false alerts by filling in empty aggregation windows with this data. For your first alert, select **None** under **Gap-filling strategy**.

4. **Select the evaluation delay**: If used, this option enables a period of time for New Relic to wait before evaluating a new signal against your set threshold. It's useful for preventing false positive incidents when a data stream begins to report. For your first alert, you can leave it to the disabled toggle unless you know that this option applies to your data.

5. Select **Next** once you've finished to save your progress and move on to the next step.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Set the static thresholds

1. Start by selecting whether the threshold will have a status of **Critical** or **Warning** in the **Security level** section.

2. Set the limit that, when met, will open an incident. These values will change depending on what you want the condition to do. For example, if you wanted to create a condition for an error message, you might set the threshold to **equal to 1 at least once in 5 minutes**, but if you wanted to create a condition for longer periods of latency issues, you might set the threshold to **above or equal to 50 for at least 15 minutes**.

3. If you want to add another threshold, select either **Add threshold** or **Add lost signal threshold**, depending on your needs. Lost signal thresholds are important for monitoring entities that may stop reporting or queries that may [return null values](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#query-order).

4. Select **Next** once you've finished to save your progress and move on to the next step.
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Add alert condition details

1. Add a name for your alert in the **Name** field. This will help you identify this condition, as well as find the condition in the future in case you need to edit or remove it.

2. Choose the policy for this condition to connect to. If you have an **Existing policy**, select it from the drop-down. If not, you'll need to [create a policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/#alert-policy-name) by selecting **New policy** and creating it from here.

3. Set any of the additional settings for the alert. This includes setting how long until open incidents are automatically closed and entering any [custom descriptions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/alert-custom-violation-descriptions/) for the incidents.

4. Select **Save condition** to finish.
    </Step>
</Steps>

You've now created a NRQL alert condition! As you get more practice using NRQL to query your data, you'll find that creating conditions this way is often faster than using charts, as you can simply write the query you need instead of needing to look for specific charts among your dashboards.

## Get more from alerting

We have some advanced alerting features that can help you make alerting more efficent and manageable for your team:

* If you want greater control over where and when you receive alerts and ensure the right people are notified about issues, see how to use [Workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* If you want to enable near-instant notification of critical alerts, helping you reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR), see how to use our [anomaly detection with applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/).
* If you want to use APIs to manage New Relic alerts, you can do so with either [REST API or GraphQL](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/alerts-api/intro-alerts-api/).
