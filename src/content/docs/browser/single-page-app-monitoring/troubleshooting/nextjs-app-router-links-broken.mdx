## Problem

You are using the Pro + SPA agent along with the Next.JS framework and the links on your page are not working.

We are aware of an incompatibility between the Pro+SPA Browser Agent and the Next.JS app router since version 13.3.2-canary.2.

This issue may be limited to the use of `prefetch` on `Link` components and/or the use of standard HTML elements that contain a `onClick` callback that invokes the `router.push()` function.

## Solution

This issue has been resolved with Next.JS release [v13.4.20-canary.5](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v13.4.20-canary.5). Please upgrade to version 13.4.20-canary.5 or later of the Next.JS framework.

## Cause

The browser agent operates by wrapping many browser globals, including Promise. Modifying the Promise global appears to result in an endless loop within the Next.JS app router when a link is clicked.
