<Callout variant="important">
    We’re rolling out this feature in phases using a feature flag to replace the existing browser SPA experience by default. There won’t be an option to choose which new SPA version you receive; you’ll always get the latest version automatically.

    </Callout> 

## SPA (released in agent v1.298.0)

Long task consideration has been introduced to replace the extensive callback tracking used in older Single Page Applications (SPA). It also serves to backfill `jsDuration`, `timeToSettle` and `timeToLastCallbackEnd` attributes of AjaxRequest event(s) associated with a BrowserInteraction.

For _select_ native browser objects wrapped by the agent's `nrWrapper`, their callbacks will be timed. Those over 50ms in duration (long task) can extend a BrowserInteraction. This followed a soft navigation heuristic to determine when an interaction occurred naturally. Now, the interaction will additionally wait and extend its duration until a period of no long task for 5 seconds, and its end time will be re-adjusted accordingly.

Previously, an AjaxRequest associated with interactions did not report or track callback timing, resulting in nullified values for the three attributes mentioned above. With the current update, `XMLHttpRequest` (but not `fetch`) that is part of an interaction and includes event listeners causing long tasks will have `jsDuration`, `timeToSettle`, and `timeToLastCallbackEnd` attributes updated to reflect the timing of long callbacks.

## SPA (released in agent v1.253.0)

For customers monitoring browser single page applications (SPA), we're excited to announce an overhaul of our SPA monitoring functionality, meant to address numerous pain points:

* Unusable latest versions: Frequent conflicts with third-party libraries and unreliable interaction capture plagued the existing agent, often rendering the latest version unusable.
* Patchwork solutions: Addressing one issue with SPA patches often introduced another, creating a frustrating cycle of fixes and regressions.
* Third-party library conflicts: Global wrapping, particularly around `Promises`, often disrupted code functionality due to conflicts with other libraries.
* Performance bottlenecks: Conflicts with code using timers, RAF, and promise chaining led to performance issues, ranging from slowdowns to freezes.

The updated SPA monitoring experience is designed to eliminate these problems and provide a significantly improved monitoring experience. Key changes include:

* Unwrapped execution: By not wrapping core globals, the new SPA experience unleashes execution speed boosts for your application.
* Aligned with soft navigation heuristics: The new experience adopts Google Chrome's soft navigation, providing more accurate interaction tracking and improved alignment with browser behavior.
* Simplified interaction determination: Interactions are now defined as a UI event (click/keydown/submit -> route change -> DOM modification), offering a clearer and more efficient capture approach.
    * Potential event disassociation: You might observe previously associated `AjaxRequest` and `JavascriptError` events becoming disassociated from interactions, reflecting the focus on UI-driven interactions.
* Focus on key metrics: While reported data remains largely unchanged, the new experience no longer tracks JavaScript execution or callback duration within interactions, streamlining the reported information.
* Reduced interaction durations: Expect significantly shorter interaction durations, particularly for route changes. Initial page loads will see a slight reduction.
* API updates:
    * New optional argument `.interaction({waitForEnd: true})` added to the [`.interaction()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/interaction/) function: This allows customization of user interaction end time. The existing `.interaction()` functionality remains unchanged.
    * Deprecated API: The function [`createTracer`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/createtracer/): While still functional, the `createTracer` function is deprecated as it no longer keeps interactions open or times callbacks. Note: If you continue to use `createTracer` with the new SPA experience,`BrowserTiming` events will not be created.


## Known issues [#known-issues]

* API usage:

    * `newrelic.interaction().end()` workaround: If you previously used this to address interaction closure issues, you might now see extra, unnecessary interactions. Review your usage to ensure optimal results.
    * `createTracer()` functionality change: `createTracer()` no longer keeps interactions open or times callbacks. If you relied on this for tracking JavaScript code, explore alternative approaches.

* `AjaxRequest` association:
    * Potential exclusion from interactions: Ajax requests that initiated near the end of previous interactions might now be excluded due to shortened interaction durations.
    * Manual extension: If you need a request to be attributed to a specific interaction, use the argument `.interaction({waitForEnd: true})` added to the [`.interaction()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/interaction/) function to keep the interaction open until the request fires, then `.end()` the interaction. This will associate the request to the interaction.
