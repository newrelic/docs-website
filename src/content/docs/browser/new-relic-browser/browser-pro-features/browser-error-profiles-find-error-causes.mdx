Error profiles give you insight about potential causes of your JavaScript errors.

## View error profiles [#view]

To view browser error profiles:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and click Browser > (select an app) > JS errors**.
2. To see error profile details: At the bottom of the JS errors UI page, select an error profile to expand it.

## What are error profiles? [#about]

In browser monitoring, an **error profile** is a potentially meaningful correlation New Relic has found between your [JavaScript error](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#javascriptError-attributes) attribute values when compared to normal [PageView events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#browser-attributes-table). These correlations help you investigate the causes and contributing factors behind your errors.

The screenshot below shows an example of an error profile.

<figcaption>
  This error profile shows that the distribution of the userAgentOS attribute values varies significantly when JS error events are compared to normal (non-error) page view events. To investigate further, you could use the [filter](#filter) to display only Windows errors and see if there are other correlations.
</figcaption>

You can also [filter the data](#filter) used to generate error profiles to help you narrow down potential causes.

For an analysis of a specific error profile, see the [example error profile explanation](#example-profile).

## Filter error profile data [#filter]

To further filter the data used to generate error profiles and their comparison page views, use these [JS errors page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-examine-errors-over-time) features:

* **Time picker**: select a time range used to generate the data.
* **Filter**: use the filter to display only error profiles and page views that have the attribute values you choose. You can select multiple attribute values.

## Example error profile explanation [#example-profile]

To help you better understand your own error profile data, this is an explanation of an example error profile's data. This error profile example has had a [filter](#filter) of `userAgentName = Chrome` applied, so it is only showing error data from Chrome browsers.

Column explanations:

* The first column is the [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute) column. It shows the attribute values with the most deviation when compared to non-error page views. Less significant attribute values are aggregated in the **Other** category. In this example, the Chrome versions 36, 64, and 65 make up 100% of the errors for Chrome users.
* The **JS errors** column shows what percentage of [`JavaScriptError` events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#javascriptError-attributes) have the attribute values from the first column. This column adds up to 100%, representing all errors from the chosen [time range and filter set](#filter). In this example, a large percentage of Chrome errors are coming from Chrome version 36. If we wanted to investigate this further, we could filter to only show version 36 data.
* The **Page views** column shows what percentage of [`PageView` events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#browser-attributes-table) have the attribute values from the first column. In this example, less than 1% of Chrome users use Chrome version 36, but 55% of errors are generated by users with that version.
* The **Difference** column shows you the difference in percentage between the **JS errors** column and the **Page views** column. In this example, the <Icon name="nr-caret-up"/>
  54% indicates that attribute is 54 percentage points higher for error events than for page views.
