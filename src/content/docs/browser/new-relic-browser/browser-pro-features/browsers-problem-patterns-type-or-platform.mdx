In New Relic browser monitoring, the **Browsers** UI provides information about your end users' experience with your app based on which browser they use, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Browsers**: Get detailed information about your end users' experience by browser type and version, device, JS errors, page load timing details, throughput, and related Core Web Vitals data.
</figcaption>

This page includes:

* Top browsers by throughput (page views per minute or `ppm`) and page load time
* Core Web Vitals data, including largest contentful paint (LCP), first input delay (FID), cumulative layout shift score (CSL), and more
* Top JavaScript errors by error, with a link to more details in the [JS errors UI](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/)
* Filterable data by device type (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Drilldown charts also segment the selected browser type by version; for example, Chrome 14, 47, 72, etc. This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or device, or whether the problem is more widespread.

## Use the Browsers UI [#browser_procedures]

For example, if you want to investigate a slow page rendering issue, you can discover which users are impacted based on their browser type.

First, go to the **Browsers** page:
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).
2. Click Browsers and select an app.
3. Under **Monitor**, click **Browsers**. 

You notice that page load time is significantly longer for Safari browsers.

To investigate what's happening with Firefox browser,  click **Firefox** from the browser type browser list and drill-down into browser-specific data.

Consider these questions when looking at the data:

* Where are spikes in the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process)?
* Are there recurring patterns over time?
* Are the average page load times and throughput within acceptable ranges?
* Are problems related to a specific browser version?
* Do the top [JavaScript errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/) indicate a problem with the code, a potential security vulnerability, or something else? 
* For this browser type, how are these performance problems affecting Core Web Vitals scores for first paint, first contentful paint, largest contentful paint, window load, and first interaction?
* How do these problems compare to other device types (desktop, mobile, tablet) or to other browser types?
