  This is an experimental browser feature and is subject to change. Use this feature with caution. Experimental features are available only for opt in manually with copy and paste or NPM implementations of the agent. To gain access for APM-injected applications, reach out to your support representative. For more information on opting in, refer to [experimental features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/experimental-features).

[Marks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) and [measures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure) are standard methods to observe and report on the performance of your webpages. They're generic events native to the browser. You can use them to measure the duration of any task. The New Relic browser agent can automatically track marks and measures as store them as `BrowserPerformance` events.

## Enable marks and measures monitoring [#enable-feature]

To enable this feature: 

1. Make sure you're using browser agent 1.272.0 or later. 
2. Locate the agent code in your webpage HTML or JS application.
3. In the `init` configuration object, and add the `performance` feature configuration. 

    Here's an example to enable both marks and measures detection:
    ```js
    <script type="text/javascript"> ;window.NREUM||(NREUM={});init={ â€¦, performance: {capture_marks: true, capture_measures: true} }:
    ```
4. Deploy your app.

## Find your data in New Relic [#find-data]

Once enabled, the agent stores marks and measures data under the `BrowserPerformance` event type in New Relic. To find this data, try the following queries and then create custom dashboards to track performance.

**Query 1**: This NRQL query retrieves all `BrowserPerformance` events for the specified `appName` ("My Application") where the `entryName` is either `mark` or `measure`. 

    ```nrql
    FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT * WHERE appName = 'My Application' AND entryName = 'mark' OR entryName = 'measure'
    ```

**Query 2**: This NRQL query calculates the average `entryDuration` for mark and measure events within the specified `appName`. The `FACET entryName` clause groups the results by the `entryName` field, providing separate average durations for mark and measure events. This can be useful for comparing the average performance of marks versus measures. 

    ```nrql
    FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT average(entryDuration) WHERE appName = 'My Application' AND entryName = 'mark' OR entryName = 'measure' FACET entryName
    ```
