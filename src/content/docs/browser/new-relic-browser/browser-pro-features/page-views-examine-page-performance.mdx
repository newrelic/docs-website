The <DNT>**Page views**</DNT> page in <InlinePopover type="browser"/> provides insight into the performance of your site's pages and user experience. Sort options help you find details about percentage of page load time, average page load time, or throughput. You can also view user frustration signals and performance impact metrics, access session replays, and explore detailed information about the top webpages viewed.

Our browser capabilities include [single-page app (SPA) monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring). If you have opted in to SPA monitoring, your SPA <DNT>**Page views**</DNT> UI will be different. You can toggle between which view (SPA or standard browser) you want.

## View summary information [#dashboard]

Browser monitoring lists page views as [URLs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/url-whitelists-grouping-browser-metrics). This makes it easy to identify specific frontend page views; for example, `/browse/plans`.

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Page views**</DNT>: This page provides detailed information about page load time, throughput, top transactions, and traces.
</figcaption>

To view detailed information about which pages the end users are viewing for your app:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Page views**</DNT>.
2. Toggle the page view for SPA or standard browser apps as applicable.
3. Select the type of view for page load timing information as a [chart (default), histogram, or percentile](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/response-time-chart-types-apm-browser/).

## Understand user impact metrics [#user-impact-metrics]

The Page views page includes user impact cards that help you understand how performance issues affect your users' experience.

### Frustration signals [#frustration-signals]

The <DNT>**Frustration signals**</DNT> card shows the percentage of user sessions containing frustration indicators in the selected time period. Frustration signals include:

* **Rage clicks**: Users rapidly clicking the same element 4 or more times within 1 second
* **Dead clicks**: Clicks that don't result in any detectable change within 2 seconds  
* **Error clicks**: Clicks followed by a JavaScript error within 2 seconds

The card displays:
* **Percentage of sessions** with frustration signals in the selected time range
* **Total sessions** and **total replays** available (hover over "View session details" for details)
* **Analyze frustration signals** link to view detailed analysis in the [User Impact page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/user-impact)

### Performance impact [#performance-impact]

The <DNT>**Performance impact**</DNT> card shows the percentage of user sessions affected by performance issues in the selected time period. Performance issues include:

* **JavaScript errors**: Unhandled exceptions and application errors
* **Poor Core Web Vitals**: Failing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), or Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) thresholds

The card displays:
* **Percentage of sessions** with performance issues in the selected time range
* **Total sessions** and **total replays** available (hover over "View session details" for details)
* **Analyze performance impact** link to view detailed analysis in the [User Impact page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/user-impact)

### Session Replay sampling considerations [#sampling-considerations]

The user impact cards adapt based on your Session Replay configuration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="sr-enabled"
    title="Session Replay enabled with standard sampling"
  >
    When Session Replay is enabled with sampling rates at or above default thresholds (10% for general sampling, 100% for error sampling), both cards display full metrics with session replay counts and direct links to replay sessions.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="sr-low-sampling"
    title="Session Replay enabled with low sampling"
  >
    When sampling rates are below recommended thresholds, the cards display a notice suggesting you increase your sample rate. Click the "Increase your sample rate" link to navigate to your browser application settings.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="sr-disabled"
    title="Session Replay disabled"
  >
    When Session Replay is disabled, the cards show only session counts without replay data. A notice appears with "See where your users are struggling" and a "Turn on session replays" link to enable the feature.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Examine performance details [#view_details]

From the page view summary, click a URL to view performance details about page load, frontend and backend timing in [APM](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time/) or in [distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui), throughput, [types of browsers](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/browsers-problem-patterns-type-or-platform), and [session traces](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle).

<img
  title="Page view details"
  alt="A screenshot of the page view details UI in New Relic"
  src="/images/browser_screenshot-full_page-load-performance.webp"
/>

From here you can also:

* Compare page load and throughput performance with yesterday and last week.
* View response time for app response time for web transactions.

## Access session replays [#session-replays]

The browser interactions table includes a <DNT>**Session replays**</DNT> column that shows the count of available session replays for each page. This integration provides direct access to qualitative user experience data alongside quantitative performance metrics.

### Session replay column features [#session-replay-column]

* **Replay counts**: The Session replays column displays the number of available replays for each browser interaction or transaction
* **Direct navigation**: Click any session replay count to open the [Session Replay list page](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay) with relevant filters applied
* **Context preservation**: Applied filters from the Page views interface carry over to Session Replay, maintaining your analysis context
* **No data indicator**: Pages without session replays show a dash (`-`) and are not clickable

### Navigate to detailed analysis [#navigate-analysis]

The user impact cards provide multiple ways to explore your data in depth:

* **View session details**: Hover over this link to see a tooltip with total sessions and available replay counts for the selected time range
* **Analyze frustration signals**: Click to navigate to the User Impact page with the Frustration metrics tab selected and relevant filters applied
* **Analyze performance impact**: Click to navigate to the User Impact page with the Performance impact tab selected and relevant filters applied

### View session replays [#view-replays]

To access session replays from the Page views table:

1. Locate the <DNT>**Session replays**</DNT> column in the browser interactions table
2. Click any session replay count to open filtered session replays
3. The Session Replay page opens with these filters automatically applied:
   * **Browser interaction name** (for SPA views) or **Browser transaction name** (for standard views)
   * **Current time range** from your Page views selection
   * **Additional context filters** based on your Page views configuration

<Callout variant="important">
  Session replay counts depend on your [Session Replay sampling configuration](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay#configure-sampling). If you see consistently low or zero counts, consider [increasing your sampling rate](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-app-settings-page#session-replay) to capture more user sessions.
</Callout>

## Examine timing details for page loads [#page_load_timing]

The [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) shows colored-coded details:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
