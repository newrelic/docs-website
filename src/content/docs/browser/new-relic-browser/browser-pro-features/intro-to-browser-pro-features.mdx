There are three [types of New Relic browser monitoring agents](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types): Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. When browser monitoring is enabled, the Pro+SPA agent is installed by default. 

The [Browser Pro feature docs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) explain the features available for the Pro and Pro+SPA agents. For more information, see [Agent types](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types).
