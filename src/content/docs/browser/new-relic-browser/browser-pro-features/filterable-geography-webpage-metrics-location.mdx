With New Relic browser monitoring, the **Filterable geos** UI page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about your front-end experience in cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. The map shows your user data by region, so you can visualize your traffic and error hotspots alongside device type information. You can also examine critical Core Web Vitals data so that you can prioritize areas around the globe needing attention.

If you work in IT or operations, this level of visual detail is especially useful for making business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage. For example, if it's unclear which regions are experiencing higher page load times than normal, our **Filterable geos** UI can help you track down the root of the problem.

For some tips on how to make the most of the available data, see the [filter examples](#filter).

## Troubleshoot performance location [#view-data]

Filterable geography functionality requires the [Pro or Pro+SPA agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#agent-types). If you have not installed this agent type, you may be able to use the [legacy **Geography** UI page](#legacy-geo).

Depending on the type of performance or usage data you select, the list next to the map shows either the top best or top worst. For example:

* With page load count and unique session count, the top of the list is the best performing.
* With average page rendering time and largest contentful paint, the top of the list is the worst performing.

To view or sort your browser monitoring performance data by location:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geos**.
2. Use the dropdown to select the type of performance or usage data you want to view, such as page load or unique session count, average time for various processes, largest contentful paint, first input delay, cumulative layout shift, etc.
3. To drill down to a specific area, mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the locations on the list.
4. To view specific performance data, [filter any attributes](#filter) below the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.
5. To compare page load and network performance with historical data, review the charts below the map on the **Map view** and **Key attribute charts** tabs.
6. To view additional charts of your data, click the **Key attribute charts** tab.

Charts on the **Key attribute charts** tab automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. These charts provide insights into performance issues related to specific locations, browsers, devices, URLs, or browser versions.

## Filter performance data [#filter]

You can filter and group data by attributes in various categories; for example:

* Webpage performance (page load time, throughput, network time, secure connection time, etc.)
* Core Web Vitals (first paint, first contentful paint, etc.)
* Users' operating systems, browser names or types, browser versions, device types
* Network performance (ASN via IP mapping and ISPs, SSL negotiation timing, DNS timing, time to first byte, etc.)

To see the list of available attributes, click the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.

  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geos > Key attributes charts**: Here is an example of charts that have been filtered so you can examine network performance by ASN organizations.
</figcaption>

The filtered results appear on both the geographical map and the key attribute charts. This makes it easy for you to use any of the standard map functions and filters to explore additional details. Here are some examples.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-asn"
    title="Example: Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN"
  >
    In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called `My-ASN`. You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geos**.
    2. From the performance type dropdown, select **Average connection setup time**.
    3. Select the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.
    4. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the filter window, fill in the attribute, operator, and value; for example, `asn = My-ASN`. Or, to compare performance with other ASNs, filter by `asnOrganization`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-promo"
    title="Example: Page rendering performance during sales promotion"
  >
    In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your `holiday-merchandise` page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geos**.
    2. Use the [time picker](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/) to change the date range to your promotion period.
    3. From the performance type dropdown, select **Average page rendering time**.
    4. Select the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon, and filter by `pageUrl` for your site's `holiday-merchandise` page and by `userAgentOS` for Android.

## Factors affecting collected data [#collected-data]

To ensure end user security, the agent collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. The agent does **not** collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, the GeoIP information would show their location as Beaverton.

To capture page load timing information, the browser monitoring agent uses the [Navigation Timing API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/navigation-timing-api), which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then the UI charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic.

Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users.

## Legacy geography page [#legacy-geo]

If you have not installed the [Pro or Pro+SPA agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#agent-types), you may be able to use the legacy **Geography** UI. This page provides a world view with color-coded [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) scores and other performance information about your end users' experience. 

To view the legacy UI page:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > More views > Geo**.
2. Select a [specific geographic region](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-settings) from the list, or select any area on the geographical map.
3. Select the type of sort, then review the detailed information for that region about page load performance and historical performance.
