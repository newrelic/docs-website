For New Relic browser monitoring, the filterable geography UI page provides a world view with color-coded performance information about your front-end experience in cities, regions, and countries anywhere around the world. 

The map shows your user data by region, and you can visualize your traffic and error hotspots alongside device type information. This level of visual detail is especially useful for professionals in IT and Operations to make business decisions about peering agreements and CDN usage.

For some tips on how to make the most of the available data, see the [filter examples](#filter).

## View performance data by location [#apdex-by-region]

Filterable geography functionality requires the [Pro or Pro+SPA agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#agent-types).

To view or sort the performance information by location:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geography**.
2. Use the dropdown to select the type of performance or usage data you want to view, such as page load or unique session count, average time for various processes, largest contentful paint, first input delay, cumulative layout shift, etc.
3. To drill down to a [specific area](#functions), mouse over or select any area on the geographical map, or select any of the ten worst performing locations from the list to the right of the map.
4. To view specific performance data, select any of the [attributes](#filter) below the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.
5. To view comparison data about page load performance and historical performance, review the charts below the map on the **Map view** tab.
6. To view additional charts of your data, click the **Key attribute charts** tab.

Charts on the **Key attribute charts** tab automatically refresh with comparative performance details for the selected location. These charts provide insights into performance issues related to specific locations, browsers, devices, URLs, or browser versions.

## Use map functions [#functions]

You can filter and drill down into detailed information, or zoom in and out of any location on the map. The enhanced attributes provide deep visibility not only about your end users' experience with page load timing, but also with network performance anywhere around the world. For example, if it's unclear which regions are experiencing higher page load times than normal, our filterable geography UI can help you track down the root of the problem.

Here is a summary of additional options with the **Filterable geography** UI.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td id="type">
        Change what kind of performance data appears
      </td>

      <td>
        Select your choice from the dropdown. Default performance indicator is **Page load count**.
        
        The map's legend lists up to the ten best or worst performing areas (depending on the selected performance indicator) for the selected time period. For example:

        * If you select **Largest contentful paint (LCP)** from the dropdown, the map's legend shows the top ten locations  measured by loading performance.
        * If you select **Average connection setup time**, the UI filters out areas with low throughput. Then the map's legend shows the top ten locations where average connection time is the slowest, as well as the average page load time and count for each.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View summary performance data about a specific location
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over any colored area on the map, select a location from the list, or zoom in and out of any area on the map.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View detailed data for a location
      </td>

      <td>
        Select any area of the map. For example:

        * If you select Canada, the map and legend show color-coded performance data for each province and territory. The list to the right of the map shows the top ten worst performing areas.
        * If you select a specific province or territory, the map shows color-coded performance data for the top ten cities.

        
        The map includes circled locations which you can mouse over or select to view detailed information. In addition, the **Page load performance** and **Historical performance** charts below the map automatically update with each location you select.
      </td>

## Filter performance data [#filter]

You can filter and group data by attributes in various categories. To see the list of available attributes, click the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.

The filtered results appear on the geographical map, where you can use any of the standard [map functions](#functions) to explore additional details. Here are some examples.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-asn"
    title="Example: Unsatisfactory network performance by ASN"
  >
    In this example, your organization is preparing to renew a peering agreement with the owner of an autonomous system, called "My-ASN." You are concerned that continued outages and other connection issues are affecting customer satisfaction with your site, and you want to compare its performance with other ASNs.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geography**.
    2. From the performance type dropdown, select **Average connection setup time**.
    3. Select the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon.
    4. To view the specific ASN's performance: From the filter window, fill in the attribute, operator, and value; for example, `asn = My-ASN`. Or, to compare performance with other ASNs, filter by `asnOrganization`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-promo"
    title="Example: Page rendering performance during sales promotion"
  >
    In this example, your organization has a special three-day sales promotion for an upcoming holiday. Your `holiday-merchandise` page has undergone major changes, including dozens of new images. You want to look for performance problems with page rendering on Android mobile devices during this sales period.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Filterable geography**.
    2. Use the [time picker](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/) to change the date range to your promotion period.
    3. From the performance type dropdown, select **Average page rendering time**.
    4. Select the funnel <Icon name="fe-filter"/> icon, and filter by `pageUrl` for your site's `holiday-merchandise` page and by `userAgentOS` for Android.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Available data [#metrics]

You can filter and group geographical performance data with metrics like:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Performance
      </th>

      <th>
        Metrics
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Webpage
      </td>

      <td>
        * [Page load time](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process)
        * Throughput (pages per minute or **ppm**)
        * Network time
        * Connection time
        * Secure connection time
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Network
      </td>

      <td>
        * Autonomous system number and name (ASN) via IP mapping
        * SSL negotiation timing
        * DNS timing
        * Time to first byte
        * ASN [latitude](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/browser-default-attributes-insights#browser-asnlatitude) and [longitude](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/browser-default-attributes-insights#browser-asnlongitude) for Internet service providers (ISPs)

      
        To ensure end user security, the agent collects GeoIP information for the end user's ISP. The agent does **not** collect GeoIP information for the specific end user. For example, if an end user in Portland, Oregon uses an ISP located in Beaverton, Oregon, the GeoIP information would show their location as Beaverton.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        User agents
      </td>

      <td>
        * Operating systems
        * Browser names or types
        * Browser versions
        * Device types
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Factors affecting collected data [#collected-data]

To capture page load timing information, the browser monitoring agent uses the [Navigation Timing API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/navigation-timing-api), which most (but not all) browsers support. If the browsers do not support the Navigation Timing API, then the UI charts and data points can only show the network data they receive for DNS lookup, connection, secure handshake, etc. This may not be 100% of the app's overall traffic.

Also, firewalls may have an impact on the geographical data collected about your end users.
