Browser monitoring's **JS errors** UI page shows you where your JavaScript errors are happening, and provides tools to help you figure out the root cause. You can also query and create dashboards of JS error data in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder), or use the browser API to monitor handled errors.

## View JavaScript errors [#find]

To examine JavaScript errors:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser) > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors**.
2. Use the [available options in the UI](#ui-features) to examine what may be causing the errors.
3. Optional: [Review event logs](#event-log) or [stack traces](#stack-trace) in the UI.
4. Optional: [Query and create dashboards for JS error data](#insights) with the query builder, or [use the API](#api-logs) to monitor or log errors.

Available options in the UI include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "220px" }}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Search through long error lists
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the **Search** <Icon name="fe-search"/>
        box so you can more quickly find and fix errors by keywords, URLs, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Group and filter [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute)
      </td>

      <td>
        * To change how your error data is grouped, use the **Group by** function. (The **Page loads** chart cannot be changed with grouping.)
        * To filter the data by only showing errors with specific attributes, use the **Filter** dropdown.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        See notable anomalies and patterns
      </td>

      <td>
        The [**Error profiles** table](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-error-profiles-find-causes-errors) shows notable statistical variations, such as browser versions or devices that have errors occurring more frequently than normal.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="error-details">
      <td>
        Examine error details
      </td>

      <td>
        * Select an error from the main page to view detailed information about that error, such as the top five browsers that error occurred on, the top five devices it occurred on, and associated URIs.
        * Select **Error instances** to see [event logs](#event-log) and [stack traces](#stack-trace), if available.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Examine events leading up to error
      </td>

      <td>
        The [**Event log**](#event-log) shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to an error.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Decode your minified JavaScript
      </td>

      <td>
        If your JavaScript is minified, the errors on the **JS errors** page may not be very useful. To decode minified JavaScript and make these error stack traces more useful, you can [upload JavaScript source maps](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/new-relic-browser-source-maps) to New Relic.

## Query and visualize JS data [#insights]

New Relic saves JS errors as [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#event). This allows you to query your error data in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder). To [run NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/insights-query-examples-new-relic-browser-single-page-app-data) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to view or share, query the [`JavaScriptError` event type](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#javascriptError-attributes) in the query builder.

## Use API to monitor handled errors [#api-logs]

To notice or log your app's handled errors or other miscellaneous errors, use the browser API's [`noticeError`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/newrelicnoticeerror-browser-agent-api) call.

## Review event logs [#event-log]

<Callout variant="important">
  [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/install-single-page-app-monitoring-new-relic-browser) must be enabled.
</Callout>

The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors.

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances**: With [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/install-single-page-app-monitoring-new-relic-browser) enabled, the event log shows you the activity leading up to an error.
</figcaption>

To view the **Event log** (if available): Go to **[one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com/) > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances**. The event log will not be visible if there are [no events in the event log](#troubleshoot-event-log).

For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call.

  <Collapser
    id="troubleshoot-event-log"
    title="Troubleshoot missing event logs"
  >
    Some reasons for events in the event log not being present:

    * **Agent version.** To capture event log data your site must have [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/install-single-page-app-monitoring-new-relic-browser) enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher).
    * **JS error not part of a browser [interaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#interaction).** If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error).
    * **A click triggered the JS error.** In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured.

      Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the [error detail charts](#error-details) to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI.

## View stack traces [#stack-trace]

Stack traces can show you if an error is breaking important functionality, or if it's a less important error. To view an error's stack trace (if available): go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors > (select an error) > Error instances**.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="stack-trace-troubleshooting"
    title="Troubleshoot missing stack traces"
  >
    Some reasons why you may not see a stack trace for an error:

    * If errors are not thrown, they will not produce a stack trace.

    * The JS script is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

    * It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see [Missing Angular errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/angularjs-errors-do-not-appear).

    * The error is a `SyntaxError` or `Script error`: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace.

    * Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable.

    * You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it.

    * If the error occurs during multiple [harvest cycles](http://[cycle](docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#harvest-cycle)) in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded.

      Some solutions for reporting stack traces:

    * Use the [`noticeError` API call](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/notice-error).

    * Enable [development mode](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/view-detailed-error-logs-browser).

    * Use the **JS errors** UI page to get more information, including the [event log](#event-log). The **JS errors** page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace.

## Global and generic errors [#js-unavailable-errors]

New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when [AngularJS errors do not appear](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/angularjs-errors-do-not-appear) in the UI.

For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable:

* `SyntaxError` or `Script error`: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace.
* In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped.
* Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available.
* Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all.

Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as [cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) errors) also are not available.
