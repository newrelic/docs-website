[Resource Assets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming) are reported natively by all major browser and allows you to observe and report on the performance of the assets your webpages import. New Relic Browser can automatically track these assets as `BrowserPerformance` events.

<Callout variant="important">
  This is an experimental browser feature and is subject to change. Use this feature with caution. Experimental features are available only for opt-in manually with copy and paste or NPM implementations of the agent. To gain access for APM-injected applications, reach out to your support representative. For more information on opting in, refer to [experimental features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/experimental-features).

Page resources detected by the browser agent will be queryable through the `BrowserPerformance` event type. You can use this data to create custom queries and dashboards in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

## Examine performance details [#view_details]

Example queries to view page resource timing data:

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT * WHERE appName = 'My Application' AND entryName = 'resource'
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT average(entryDuration) as 'ms' WHERE entryType = 'resource' facet initiatorType
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT average(connectEnd - connectStart) as 'TCP Handshake', average(domainLookupEnd - domainLookupStart) as 'DNS Lookup', average(redirectEnd - redirectStart) as 'Redirection Time', average(responseStart - requestStart) as 'Request Time' timeseries 3 minutes
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT percentage(count(*), where decodedBodySize <= encodedBodySize) as 'Compressed Payloads' where entryType = 'resource'
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT percentage(count(*), where transferSize = 0) as 'Cached Payloads' where entryType = 'resource'
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT percentage(count(*), where renderBlockingStatus is NOT NULL ) as 'Render Blocking Resources' where entryType = 'resource'
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT max(responseStart - requestStart) as 'Request Time' facet entryName
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT max(domainLookupEnd - domainLookupStart) as 'DNS Lookup Time' facet entryName
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT max(responseStart - requestStart) as 'Request Time' facet currentUrl
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT max(connectEnd - connectStart) as 'TCP Handshake Time' facet entryName
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT count(*) where firstParty is true facet initiatorType limit 100
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT count(*) facet cases(where firstParty is true as 'First Party Asset')
```

```nrql
FROM BrowserPerformance SELECT average(entryDuration) facet cases(where firstParty is true as 'First Party Asset', where 1=1 as Other)
```
