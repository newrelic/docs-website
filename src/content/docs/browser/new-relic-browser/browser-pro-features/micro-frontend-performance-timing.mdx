New Relic Browser captures performance timing data for micro-frontends (MFEs) to help you understand how long your modular application components take to load and become ready for use.

## Available timing metrics

The following timings are captured for micro-frontends as attributes on a `MicroFrontEndTiming` event:

### timeToLoad

**Description**: The time from the beginning of loading the MFE until the time the MFE is registered to report, reported in MS.

**Measurement**:
* **Start time**: `fetchStart` (or Page origin `0` if no remote resource timing is found)
* **End time**: `.register()` call time
* **Duration**: End - Start

<Callout variant="tip">
  If no resource timing is found (for example, the registered entity was pre-bundled with the main app code), this metric reports as `0`.
</Callout>

### timeToBeRequested

**Description**: The time from the page origin time until the MFE was requested to be lazy-loaded, reported in MS.

**Measurement**:
* **Start time**: Page origin (`0`)
* **End time**: `fetchEnd` (or `0` if no resource timing is found)
* **Duration**: End - Start

<Callout variant="tip">
  If no resource timing is found (for example, the registered entity was pre-bundled with the main app code), this metric reports as `0`.
</Callout>

### timeToFetch

**Description**: The time it takes the registering MFE script to load from a remote resource.

**Measurement**:
* **Start time**: `fetchStart` (or `0` if no resource timing is found)
* **End time**: `fetchEnd` (or `0` if no resource timing is found)
* **Duration**: End - Start

<Callout variant="tip">
  If no resource timing is found (for example, the MFE was pre-bundled with the main app code), this metric reports as `0`.
</Callout>

### timeToRegister

**Description**: The time it takes to initialize the register call relative to beginning of the script execution. This is akin to a "ready" state, assuming that registering with the main agent signals that the script is ready for duty.

**Measurement**:
* **Start time**: `fetchEnd` (or `0` if no resource timing is found)
* **End time**: `.register()` call time
* **Duration**: End - Start

### timeAlive

**Description**: The time the script is "alive"—from the time it registers until the time it deregisters. This relies on the user to indicate when tracking the script is no longer needed, and is assumed to be the "end" of the script lifecycle.

**User story**: I want to know how long my MFE is being used/tracked once initialized.

**Measurement**:
* **Start time**: `.register()` call time
* **End time**: `.deregister()` call time (or `pageHide` time if no deregister call is made)
* **Duration**: End - Start

<Callout variant="tip">
  If no `.deregister()` call is made, this metric is reported at `pageHide` time. 
</Callout>
