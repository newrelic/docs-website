If you are using browser to monitor your application, you can manually disable monitoring for your app or for specific pages. Reasons for turning off <InlinePopover type="browser"/> on certain pages include:

* Some pages may not be relevant for monitoring.
* You want to monitor only specific pages.
* You want to remove the browser script for troubleshooting purposes.

## Disable monitoring of specific pages/URLs [#disable]

To disable browser on a specific page or URL, follow the procedures based on your deployment method:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="agent"
    title="Deployed with selected APM agent"
  >
    If you used the <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent to automatically insert your JavaScript snippet, you can disable injection for only those particular pages using the APM language agent's API or config file. For more information, see the instructions for your agent:

    * Go (currently not applicable)
    * [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java#disable-auto-specific)
    * [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/features/page-load-timing-net#disable_instrumentation_pageview)
    * [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-nodejs#disabling): This agent does not automatically insert JavaScript. To turn off monitoring on certain pages, simply remove the API calls from those pages.
    * [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/new-relic-browser-php-agent#disable)
    * [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python#disabling_instrumentation)
    * [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ignoring-specific-transactions#page-load-timing-rum)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="copy-paste"
    title="Deployed with copy/paste method"
  >
    If you used the [copy/paste deployment method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#copy-paste-app) and want to stop collecting data for a browser app, simply remove the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet from the pages you do not want to monitor.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Disable domain monitoring [#domains]

To turn off monitoring for specific domains or sub-domains, update your browser [domain conditions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/monitor-or-block-specific-domains-subdomains).

## Disable browser agent [#disable-agent]

If you used the [copy/paste deployment method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#copy-paste-app) and want to stop collecting data for a browser app, simply remove the browser JavaScript snippet from the pages you do not want to monitor. If you used the [APM agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#select-apm-app) to install the browser agent, you can turn off some of the browser monitoring features individually, or you can disable browser entirely.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities), click on Browser > (select a browser app) > Settings > Application settings**</DNT>.
2. To disable only the [Pro account level features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser), select <DNT>**Lite**</DNT>.
3. To turn off browser monitoring completely, select <DNT>**Off**</DNT>.
4. Select <DNT>**Save application settings**</DNT>.
5. If applicable, restart your <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent.

When browser monitoring is off, the agent will not instrument pages with monitoring scripts.
