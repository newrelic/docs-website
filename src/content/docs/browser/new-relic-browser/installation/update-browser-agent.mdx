Running the latest version of Browser monitoring ensures you can access all Browser features and enhancements. To update to the latest version, [check your version number](#checking), then follow the steps to [update an APM-managed installation](#upgrading-apm) or to [upgrade a copy/paste installation](#upgrading-copy-paste).

## Check your version number [#checking]

To verify your Browser version number:

1. View the source code of a page which includes the JavaScript snippet.
2. Search the page source for `js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-`.

The numbers that follow `nr-` are your current version. For example, `js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-593.min.js` indicates you are running version 593 of the Browser script. The Pro+SPA agent will have the format `js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1184.min.js`

To verify the latest version of the Browser script loader:

1. Go to [https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js](https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js) .
2. Search for `js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-`, then note the numbers that follow `nr-`.

If the latest version number is higher than the number of the version you are currently running, update your Browser agent.

## Check deployment method [#deploy-method]

Your Browser agent may have been deployed using the copy/paste method rather than injected with APM. To check which deployment method was used, run this command in the JavaScript console:

```
> newrelic.info.sa
```

If the command returns `1`, then your Browser agent used the copy/paste method.

## Update your APM-managed installation [#upgrading-apm]

To update your APM-managed Browser installation, restart your APM agent. Your app will automatically update to the latest JavaScript snippet.

To ensure the new script registers, you may need to clear your cache. For more information, follow the troubleshooting procedures to [manually check and clear the cache](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation#manual_check_cache).

## Update your copy/paste installation [#upgrading-copy-paste]

Use any of the following options to access the Browser JavaScript snippet needed to update a copy/paste installation. After accessing the snippet, be sure to replace **all** of your existing snippet with the new version.

* If you have a standalone installation with a few applications, you can retrieve the snippet from the UI, and then replace it with the new version.
* If you have many applications, you can use the REST API or the loader endpoint to automate the update process.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Do not simply change the version number in the existing snippet. This can result in incomplete data collection. For best results after you use any of the following options, always update the agent.

    title="Retrieve the snippet from the UI"

    Download the latest version of the snippet: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Browser > (select an app) > Application settings**.

    This option is only available for standalone installations.

    title="Extract the snippet with the REST API"

    To update the snippet using the New Relic REST API, follow the process for [viewing a specific Browser app](/docs/apm/apis/browser-examples-v2/adding-or-listing-browser-apps-api-v2#specific-browser-app). The `loader_script` attribute in your response will include the latest JavaScript snippet.

    This may be a good solution if you have many applications to manage, or if your Browser app is linked to an APM app.

    title="Update using the loader endpoint"
  >
    To update the snippet from the New Relic loader endpoint, use the [Browser Pro + SPA endpoint](https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-spa-current.min.js), the [Browser Pro endpoint](https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-full-current.min.js), or the [Browser Lite endpoint](https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-loader-rum-current.min.js). These endpoints always point to the latest version of the script snippet.

    **Recommendation:** Use the Browser Pro or Pro + SPA loaders regardless of your Browser subscription level. These loaders are compatible with both the Pro and Lite subscription levels.

    These loader endpoints are generic and do not include your specific configuration data. To add your configuration data to the loaders:

    1. Find your Browser application ID and license key: Follow standard procedures to use the [New Relic UI](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/copying-your-browser-monitoring-license-key-app-id) or the [REST API](/docs/apm/apis/browser-examples-v2/adding-or-listing-browser-apps-api-v2#specific-browser-app).
    2. Set your Browser application ID and license key immediately after the snippet.

       ```
       NREUM.info = { applicationID: "YOUR-APPLICATION-ID",
                      licenseKey:    "YOUR-BROWSER-LICENSE-KEY" };
       ```
