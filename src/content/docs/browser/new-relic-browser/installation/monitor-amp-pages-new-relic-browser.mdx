BETA

To collect performance data from HTML pages formatted for [Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/overview/), you must add New Relic Browser's AMP agent to your AMP pages. This agent leverages the [`amp-analytics` agent](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-analytics) to define the relevant New Relic events and send them to New Relic to be captured for reporting.

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Browser's AMP agent is currently available as a private beta. In addition to New Relic Browser's [installation requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-browser), Browser's AMP agent requires:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Browser AMP requirements**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td id="version">
        New Relic Browser
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic Browser requirements include Browser Pro account, which includes access to New Relic Insights data depending on your [Browser subscription level](https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring/pricing).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="app-id">
        Browser app ID
      </td>

      <td>
        To capture AMP throughput, New Relic Browser needs the `app ID` for each app:

        1. Go to [rpm.newrelic.com/browser](https://rpm.newrelic.com/browser) and select an application from the index.
        2. Copy the numeric value that follows `/browser/1234567890` in the URL.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="key">
        Browser monitoring license key
      </td>

      <td>
        To obtain only the browser monitoring [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/copy-browser-monitoring-license-key-app-id):

        1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/browser](https://rpm.newrelic.com/browser "Link opens in a new window.") > Settings**.
        2. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file.
        3. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key (just above the ending `</script>` tag), and save.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Install Browser's AMP agent [#deploy-amp-agent]

New Relic has partnered with The Amp Project to incorporate New Relic Browser's AMP agent in with the AMP Analytics repo.

To install the Browser AMP agent into your AMP app:

1. Add the attribute `newrelic` to your AMP analytics code. For more information, see the [AMP site](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/ads_analytics/analytics-vendors#new-relic).
2. Add the browser [`app ID`](#app-id) and [`license key`](#key). To send data from one AMP page to multiple Browser apps, include quote marks and a comma to separate each Browser `app ID`. For example: `"appId": ["123", "124", "125"]`

```
<amp-analytics type="newrelic" id="newrelic">
<script type="application/json">
  {
    "vars": {
      "appId": "",
      "licenseKey": ""
    }
  }
</script>
</amp-analytics>
```

## View reported AMP events in Insights [#view-amp-events]

Currently, your AMP data will not appear in the New Relic Browser UI. This is intentional; any AMP data sent to the New Relic collector will be removed automatically from your Browser metrics.

In the meantime, use New Relic Insights to compare your AMP page to non-AMP pages. The dashboard data provides standard performance key metrics.

New Relic stores AMP events in the `PageView` and `BrowserInteraction` schemas. To [view the AMP events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/event-explorer-query-chart-your-event-data), run the following Insights queries:

* `SELECT * FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp'`
* `SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE mobileOptimized = 'amp'`

**[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Event explorer**: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard showing AMP event data after you install New Relic Browser's AMP JavaScript snippet into the body of your AMP pages.

## Replace copy/pasted agent with library reference [#replace]

If you previously copy/pasted New Relic Browser's AMP agent JS Snippet onto your AMP pages, you can now pull the snippet from AMP Analytics instead. Remove New Relic Browser's AMP agent JS snippet from your AMP pages, and then follow the [instructions to install Browser's AMP agent](#deploy-amp-agent).

## For more help [#more_help]

During the beta period, [email your AMP feedback](mailto:ampbeta@newrelic.com) to the New Relic Browser team.
