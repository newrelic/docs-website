Configure micro frontend monitoring to track the performance and user experience of individual components within your web application. This guide walks you through setting up entities, configuring the browser agent, and enabling data collection for your micro frontends.

## Before you begin [#before-you-begin]

Before configuring micro frontend monitoring, ensure you have:

- A **Pro** or **Pro+SPA** browser agent (version 1.302.0 or higher) installed on your container application
- Admin permissions to create new browser entities in your New Relic account
- Identified the micro frontends or components you want to monitor independently

<Callout variant="important">
Micro frontend monitoring is not available with the Lite browser agent. You must use Pro or Pro+SPA to successfully invoke the `register` API and related features.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Set up your container application [#container-setup]

Your container application must have a browser agent installed to serve as the central monitoring infrastructure for all micro frontends.

### Install or verify browser agent [#verify-agent]

<Steps>
<Step>

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Browser**.

</Step>
<Step>

Select your container application or create a new browser app if needed.

</Step>
<Step>

Verify you're using **Pro** or **Pro+SPA** agent type in the **Application settings**.

</Step>
<Step>

Ensure the browser agent code is installed in your container application.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Configure container agent features [#container-features]

For full coverage, ensure all features are enabled in your container agent that will be shared with micro frontends:

<Steps>
<Step>

If using NPM, enable these features as needed (which are enabled by default):
- **JavaScript Errors**
- **Generic Events**
- **Logs**

For all other installations, the Pro or Pro+Spa builds of the agent will have the features needed for micro frontend observability by default.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Register micro frontends [#register-mfes]

Use the `register` API to connect your micro frontend components to their entities. Upon successful data harvest, new entities will be spawned and maintained based on the `id` and `name` values supplied.

### Basic registration [#basic-registration]

```js
// In your micro frontend component code
const mfeAgent = newrelic.register({
  id: '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  name: 'Product Catalog MFE'
});

// Start using the scoped agent
mfeAgent.setCustomAttribute('version', '1.2.3');
mfeAgent.addPageAction('componentLoaded');
```


## Step 3: Configure data duplication (optional) [#data-duplication]

By default, data from micro frontends is only sent to their specific entities. You can optionally configure data duplication to also send micro frontend data to the container entity.

<Callout variant="caution">
Enabling data duplication increases your data ingest and may impact billing. Use this feature when you need to see both aggregated and individual micro frontend views.
</Callout>

```js
// This feature is configured at the container agent level
window.NREUM.init.api = {
  duplicate_registered_data: true  // Send MFE data to both entities
};
```

## Step 6: Validate your configuration [#validate-configuration]

Verify that your micro frontend monitoring is working correctly:

### Check entity creation [#check-entities]

<Steps>
<Step>

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Browser**.

</Step>
<Step>

Verify that each micro frontend entity appears in your Micro Front End entity list.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration best practices [#best-practices]

### Naming conventions [#naming-conventions]

Use consistent naming patterns for easy management:

```js
// Good: Descriptive names
const checkoutAgent = newrelic.register({
  id: '7f3e9a2b-c1d4-4e5f-a6b7-8c9d0e1f2a3b',
  name: 'Checkout Flow - Production'
});
```

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

**Registration fails or returns null**
- Verify the container browser agent is loaded and Pro/Pro+SPA
- Check that the micro frontend entity exists in New Relic
- Ensure the `id` parameter matches the entity's Application ID

**No data appearing in micro frontend entity**
- Confirm you're calling methods on the returned agent object, not the global `newrelic`
- Check that events are being triggered after registration completes
- Verify network connectivity and that data is being sent to New Relic

**Data appearing in wrong entity**
- Make sure you're using the scoped agent returned by `register`
- Check for conflicting global `newrelic` calls in your component code
- Verify the `id` is consistent and supplied as expected
