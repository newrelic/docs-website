Good <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> help notify individuals or teams about changes in their systems. [Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/new-relic-alerts) provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across New Relic products. This allows you to manage [alert policies](/docs/alerts/overview#alert-policy) and [conditions](/docs/alerts/overview#alert-condition) that focus on the metrics for [entities](/docs/alerts/overview#alert-entity) (such as browser apps or key transactions) that you care about the most.

After you [set up one or more alert policies](/docs/alerts/organize-alerts/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) and [define alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) for your [product entities (targets)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition), you can view that information in the alerts UI. You can also view alert policy information in the UI for individual products.

## View policies and conditions from browser [#policy]

To view alert policy and condition information for a specific browser app or key transaction:

1. Browser app: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**</DNT>.

   OR

   Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Settings > Alert conditions**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Alert conditions**</DNT> page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies.

## View events and activities from browser [#activity]

To view summary information about [events](/docs/alerts/overview#event) and other activity:

1. Browser app: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser**</DNT>

   OR

   Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Key transactions**</DNT>.
2. From the index, mouse over the entity's [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/overview#health-status), select a link from the <DNT>**Browser activity**</DNT> list, or select a specific browser app or key transaction to view additional details.

For example, if a Critical alert event occurs:

* The health status indicator turns red on the browser index and on the selected browser app.
* The background color for various charts changes to pink.
* The <DNT>**Browser activity**</DNT> list on the browser index shows Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) alert events as applicable.
To learn more about the alert event in alerts, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart. For more information and examples, see [View events from their products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/view-events-their-products).

## View alert events from browser [#alertevents]

If an alert condition has [thresholds](/docs/alerts/overview#alert-threshold) set up for Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) alert events, the color-coded [health status](/docs/alerts/overview#health-status) for a product entity will change to indicate an alert event. You can view the alert events directly from the browser app's or key transaction's page in browser:

1. Browser app: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select a browser app)**</DNT>, and check the alert events on the right panel.

   Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Issues & Activity**</DNT> and click the <DNT>**Alert events**</DNT> tab.
2. From the <DNT>**Alert events**</DNT> page, use the available tools to search, sort, or view alert events for the selected browser app or key transaction.
3. Optional: To view or update the alert policies, conditions, or thresholds that triggered the alert events, select the corresponding link.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also view Warning and Critical alert events from the alerts UI for [specific alert events](/docs/alerts/alert-event-management/view-alert-event-details) or for [alert events and events across all products](/docs/alerts/alert-event-management/view-alert-event-details). Alerts sends [alert notifications](/docs/alerts/get-notified/destinations) only for Critical (red) alert events.
