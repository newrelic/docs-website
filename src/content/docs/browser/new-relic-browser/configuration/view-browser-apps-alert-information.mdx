  In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Monitor (Synthetics) violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to `one.newrelic.com`. For more information, see the documentation about [Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai) and the [July 2020 Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-feature-end-of-life-announcements/105772).

Good alerts help notify individuals or teams about changes in their systems. [Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/new-relic-alerts) provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across New Relic products. This allows you to manage [alert policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-policy) and [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) that focus on the metrics for [entities](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-entity) (such as browser apps or key transactions) that you care about the most.

After you [set up one or more alert policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/name-or-rename-alert-policy) and [define alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) for your [product entities (targets)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition), you can view that information in the Alerts & AI UI. You can also view alert policy information in the UI for individual products.

## View policies and conditions from browser [#policy]

To view alert policy and condition information for a specific browser app or key transaction:

1. Browser app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser) and click on Browser > (select a browser app) > Settings > Alert conditions**.

   OR

   Key transaction: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser) and click on More > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Settings > Alert conditions**.
2. From the **Alert conditions** page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies.

## View events and activities from browser [#activity]

To view summary information about [events](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#event) and other activity:

1. Browser app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser) and click on Browser**

   OR

   Key transaction: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser) and click on More > Key transactions**.
2. From the index, mouse over the entity's [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status), select a link from the **Browser activity** list, or select a specific browser app or key transaction to view additional details.

For example, if a Critical alert violation occurs:

* The health status indicator turns red on the browser index and on the selected browser app.
* The background color for various charts changes to pink.
* The **Browser activity** list on the browser index shows Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) violations as applicable.

To learn more about the violation in Alerts, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart. For more information and examples, see [View events from their products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/view-events-their-products).

## View alert violations from browser [#violations]

If an alert condition has [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) set up for Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations, the color-coded [health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status) for a product entity will change to indicate a violation. You can view the violations directly from the browser app's or key transaction's page in browser:

1. Browser app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser)** and click on **Browser > (select a browser app)**, and check the violations on the right panel.

   Key transaction: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/browser)** and click on **More > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Events > Violations**.
2. From the **Violations** page, use the available tools to search, sort, or view violations for the selected browser app or key transaction.
3. Optional: To view or update the alert policies, conditions, or thresholds that triggered the violations, select the corresponding link.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also view Warning and Critical violations from the New Relic One Alerts & AI UI for [specific incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) or for [incidents and events across all products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/review-events-across-products). Alerts sends [alert notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) only for Critical (red) violations.
