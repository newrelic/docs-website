metaDescription: "Information about the different New Relic browser monitoring agent types (Lite, Pro, or Pro+SPA)."
---

The browser agent type has no impact on your billing. It's simply a way to switch to a more minimal set of features, if desired. The default browser agent installed comes with all browser monitoring features enabled. 

To change your browser edition type, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.

Here are some comparisons between the different browser agent types: 

## Browser agent types [#agent-types]

We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA.

        Pro+SPA
      </td>

      <td>
        This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. It gives you access to all browser monitoring features. 

        Pro+SPA is not useful only for single page applications. After install, you can downgrade to the lower agent types if you don't want or need SPA monitoring.
