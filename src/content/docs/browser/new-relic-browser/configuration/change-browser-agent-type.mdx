The browser agent type has no impact on your billing. It's simply a way to switch to a more minimal set of features, if desired. The default browser agent installed comes with all <InlinePopover type="browser"/> features enabled.

To change your browser edition type, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**</DNT>.

Here are some comparisons between the different browser agent types:

## Browser agent types [#agent-types]

We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA.

      </td>

      <td>
        This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. It gives you access to all browser monitoring features.

        Pro+SPA is not useful only for single page applications. After install, you can downgrade to the lower agent types if you don't want or need SPA monitoring.
