If you need to customize how the browser agent collects data, you have two methods: configure the UI, or use APIs to customize the agent instrumentation.

## UI configurations [#UI]

On the <DNT>**Application settings**</DNT> page, you can make these configurations to your <InlinePopover type="browser"/> setup:

* [Proxy agent code and analytics data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/proxy-agent-requests/)
* [Set up alerts](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/view-browser-apps-alert-information/)
* [Configure APDEX and geography settings](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-apdex-geography/#apdex-settings)
* [Filter domains and sub-domains](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/monitor-or-block-specific-domains-subdomains/)
* [Filter AJAX requests](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/filter-ajax-request-events/)
* [Group data by URL patterns](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/)
* [Obfuscate Data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/obfuscate-browser-agent-data/)
* [Rename browser apps](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/rename-browser-apps/)
* [Disable browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/disable-browser-monitoring/)
* [Delete a browser app](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/#remove)

### Browser session storage [#browser-session-storage]

We've consolidated the control for collecting session traces and session replay data within the browser agent. You can now manage all session-level data directly from the <DNT>**Access browser local storage**</DNT> toggle on this settings page.

{/* * **Access browser local storage toggle**: This unified control determines how session-level data (including session IDs and other session-level attributes) is collected.
    * **When turned ON (default)**: The New Relic browser agent uses the browser's persistent storage mechanisms to collect session trace and session replay data.
    * **When turned OFF**: The New Relic browser agent immediately halts its use of the browser's persistent storage. This action prevents the collection of all session trace and session replay data, giving you direct control over the browser's handling of session-related information and enhancing your ability to meet data privacy and compliance requirements. */}

<Callout variant="important">

The **Access local storage** toggle is being removed from the UI to streamline our privacy and consent features.

* The recommended way to manage browser agent data collection and user consent is with the consent mode config. We strongly encourage all users to adopt this new feature. For more information, refer to [consent docs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/consent-mode/).

* If you currently have the **Access local storage** toggle set to `OFF`, you will find that the consent mode, session replay, and session trace toggles are also inactive. To enable these features, you must set the `cookie_enabled` attribute to `true` via [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/browser-monitoring-config-nerdgraph/#configure-browser-application). This action will re-activate the toggles in the UI, allowing you to properly configure consent Mode, session replay, and session trace.

{/* To get to the <DNT>**Application settings**</DNT> page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser**</DNT> and select an app.
2. On the left navigation, scroll down to <DNT>**Settings**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Application settings**</DNT>. */}

## Browser APIs [#apis]

You can also customize your browser agent instrumentation to capture custom traces and events, report specific errors tailored to your needs, and fine-tune data harvest timing for optimal performance. See [Using browser APIs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/using-browser-apis/) to get started.
