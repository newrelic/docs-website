title: 'Configure browser agent data collection with the app settings page'
metaDescription: "For New Relic browser monitoring: use the app settings page to configure the agent type and deployment method."

There are several configuration options that regulate what data the browser agent reports. This is a factor when [enabling browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent), and you can also change these configurations afterward. 

To get to the app settings page: 

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com), and click **Browser**. 
2. Select an app. 
3. On the left navigation, click **App settings**. 

If you don't have access to this, it may be due to permissions.
