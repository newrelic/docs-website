There are several configuration options that regulate what data the browser agent reports. This is a factor when [enabling browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent), and you can also change these configurations afterward.

To get to the **Application settings** page:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser**.
2. Select an app.
3. On the left navigation, click **Application settings**.
