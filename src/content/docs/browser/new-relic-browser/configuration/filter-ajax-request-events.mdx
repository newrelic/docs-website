title: 'Filter AjaxRequest events'
metaDescription: "For New Relic browser monitoring: use the app settings page to filter which network calls are recorded as AjaxRequest events."
---
In [agent version 1211](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/) or higher, all network requests made by a page are recorded as `AjaxRequest` events. You can use the deny list configuration options in the **Application settings** page to filter which requests record events. 
Regardless of this filter, all network requests are captured as metrics and available in the AJAX page.

## Using the deny list
Requests can be blocked in three ways:
  * To block recording of all `AjaxRequest` events, add an asterisk `*` as a wildcard.
  * To block recording of `AjaxRequest` events to a domain, enter just the domain name. Example: `example.com`
  * To block recording of `AjaxRequest` events to a specific domain and path, enter the domain and path. Example: `example.com/path`

The protocol, port, search and hash of a URL are ignored by the deny list.

## Access the deny list
To update the deny list of URLs your application will filter from creating events, go to the app settings page:
1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com), and click **Browser**. 
2. Select an app. 
3. On the left navigation, click **App settings**.
4. Under **Ajax Request Deny List**, add the filters you would like to apply to your app.
5. Select **Save application settings** to update the agent configuration.
6. [Redeploy the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/upgrade-browser-agent) (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste browser installation).


## Validation

To validate whether the filters you have added work as expected, run a NRQL query for `AjaxRequest` events matching your filter.

```
FROM AjaxRequest SELECT * WHERE requestUrl LIKE `%example.com%`
```
