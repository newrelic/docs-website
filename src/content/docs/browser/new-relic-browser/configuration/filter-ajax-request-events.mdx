In [agent version 1211](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/) or higher, all network requests made by a page are recorded as `AjaxRequest` events. You can use the deny list configuration options in the <DNT>**Application settings**</DNT> page to filter which requests record events.

## Using the deny list

Requests can be blocked in three ways:

* To block recording of all `AjaxRequest` events, add an asterisk `*` as a wildcard.
* To block recording of `AjaxRequest` events to a domain, enter just the domain name. Example: `example.com`
* To block recording of `AjaxRequest` events to a specific domain and path, enter the domain and path. Example: `example.com/path`

The protocol, port, search and hash of a URL are ignored by the deny list.

## Access the deny list

To update the deny list of URLs your application will filter from creating events, go to the app settings page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**</DNT>.
2. Under <DNT>**Ajax Request Deny List**</DNT>, add the filters you would like to apply to your app.
3. Select <DNT>**Save application settings**</DNT> to update the agent configuration.
4. [Redeploy the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/upgrade-browser-agent) (either restarting the associated <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent or updating the copy/paste browser installation).

## Validation

To validate whether the filters you have added work as expected, run a NRQL query for `AjaxRequest` events matching your filter.

```sql
FROM AjaxRequest SELECT * WHERE requestUrl LIKE `%example.com%`
```
