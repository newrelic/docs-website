Pages can be cached in the browser or on a server. A cached page will contain stale (previously generated) application and queue times.

## Detecting cached pages

Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, Browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0.

Here are some additional tips for cached pages:

* **Java**: Flush the app serverâ€™s "work" cache. This forces the app server to recompile.
* **.NET**: Make sure your **asp.net** cache directory is clean by using the command `flush_dotnet_temp.cmd`. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation.
* **Node.js**: By default, Node.js does not cache pages.
* **PHP**: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation.
* **Python**: Restart your app.
* **Ruby**: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the [user interface](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-settings), and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.
