Browser monitoring's [page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) feature can track sessions by using [cookies](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/new-relic-cookies-used-browser#jsessionid) that contain a simple session identifier. Here is the basic process:

1. A session begins when a user visits a website with Browser monitoring installed.
2. After the user's browser is opened, the Browser monitoring script sets a simple cookie identifying the session.
3. The script then reads the cookie on subsequent page loads.
4. The same session will continue until the user's browser is closed.

Session tracking will not work properly in these situations:

* If users have cookies disabled in their browser
* If the browser is configured to **not** allow information associated with the New Relic cookie to be sent with the request from the monitored site
