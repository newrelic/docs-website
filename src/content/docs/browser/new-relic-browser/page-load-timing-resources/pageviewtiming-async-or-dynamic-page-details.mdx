Browser monitoring's [`PageViewTiming` event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=PageViewTiming) sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use `PageViewTiming` and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.

## Why use PageViewTiming? [#why-pageviewtiming]

If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent.

For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded.

The `PageViewTiming` event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.

## Support for Google's Core Web Vitals

As of [agent version 1177](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1177) for browser monitoring, we have full support for [Google's Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals). This feature is available in all flavors of the agent (Lite, Pro, or Pro+SPA).

Note that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals [evolve](https://web.dev/vitals/#evolving-web-vitals) over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. It includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds:

  Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability.
</figcaption>

* **[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)**: measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur **within 2.5 seconds** of when the page first starts loading.
* **[First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/)**: measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of **less than 100 milliseconds**.
* **[Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/)**: measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of **less than 0.1**.

For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

## Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics [#interactivity-metrics]

The `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events end their reporting when they receive the [page window load](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. `PageViewTiming` delivers these metrics as a separate event to:

* Account for the variability in this timing.
* Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout.
* Prevent holding `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events indefinitely.

        The [`firstPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstpaint) and [`firstContentfulPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstContentfulPaint) attributes already are available with `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires.

        Using `PageViewTiming` gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content.

        The [`largestContentfulPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/largestcontentfulpaint),metric is available with [agent version 1163 or higher](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1163). It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport.

        Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the [w3c draft](https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/).

        We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as `cumulativeLayoutShift`.

        Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered "Good," between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered "Needs Improvement," and above 4.0 secs are considered "Poor."

      <td>
        With the addition of [`firstInteraction`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstinteraction) and [`firstInputDelay`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstinputdelay), you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site.

        The `firstInputDelay` metric lies in the middle of `FirstContentfulPaint` and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions.

        We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as `cumulativeLayoutShift.`

        First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). FID values up to 100 ms are considered "Good," between 100-300 ms are considered "Needs Improvement," and above 300 ms are considered "Poor."

CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring [visual stability](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#types-of-metrics) because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is [delightful](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#questions).

INP is a newer metric for measuring [runtime responsiveness](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#types-of-metrics) and user-perceived performance.

        It's generally recommended to [break up and optimize](https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/) these tasks to prevent delays in processing user input or interactions. Long tasks may affect or closely relate to the `interactionToNextPaint` metric.

In modern practice, this signals the _potential end_ of a user session most reliably. This event always accompanies `windowUnload` if that occurs, but it can also fire separately when the user switches tab. In that case, the unload isn't fired.

## CumulativeLayoutShift [#cumulative-layout-shift]

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see [web.dev/cls](https://web.dev/cls/).

### How is CLS captured in New Relic

Shifts in page layout as reported by the [Layout Instability API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Layout_Instability_API) are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all `PageViewTiming` events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred.

Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page.

### Approximating other CLS sources

Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the `windowLoad` `PageViewTiming` event.

CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the `windowUnload` `PageViewTiming` event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page.

### How CLS is aggregated

As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in [Evolving the CLS metric](https://web.dev/cls-web-tooling/).

**Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher:**

Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values.

**Prior to Browser agent v12xx:**

A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.
