Browser monitoring's [`PageViewTiming` event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=PageViewTiming) sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use `PageViewTiming` and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.

## Why use PageViewTiming? [#why-pageviewtiming]

If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent.

For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded.

The `PageViewTiming` event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.

## Support for Google's Core Web Vitals

We now, with the release of [agent version 1177](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1177), have full support for [Google's Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will [evolve](https://web.dev/vitals/#evolving-web-vitals) over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—_loading_, _interactivity_, and _visual stability_—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds):

  Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability.

* **[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)**: measures _loading_ performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within **2.5 seconds** of when the page first starts loading.
* **[First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/)**: measures _interactivity_. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than **100 milliseconds**.
* **[Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/)**: measures _visual stability_. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than **0.1.**

For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

## Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics [#interactivity-metrics]

The `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events end their reporting when they receive the [page window load](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. `PageViewTiming` delivers these metrics as a separate event to:

* Account for the variability in this timing.
* Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout.
* Prevent holding `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events indefinitely.

        The [`firstPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstpaint) and [`firstContentfulPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstContentfulPaint) attributes already are available with `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires.

        Using `PageViewTiming` gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content.

        This new metric, available with [agent version 1163](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1163), [`largestContentfulPaint`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/largestcontentfulpaint), reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. Details on this metric, including limitations and considerations can be found in the [w3c draft](https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/).

        In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as `cumulativeLayoutShift.`

        Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered "Good", between 2.5-4.0 secs considered "Needs Improvement", and above 4.0 secs considered "Poor."

        With the addition of [`firstInteraction`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstinteraction) and [`firstInputDelay`](/attribute-dictionary/pageviewtiming/firstinputdelay), you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site.

        The `firstInputDelay` metric lies in the middle of `FirstContentfulPaint` and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics, measuring the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions.

        In addition, we now report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as `cumulativeLayoutShift.`

        First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). FID values up to 100 ms are considered "Good", between 100-300 ms considered "Needs Improvement", and above 300 ms considered "Poor."

This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

        Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered "Good", between 0.1-0.25 considered "Needs Improvement", and above 0.25 considered "Poor."

        You can review different types of activities with the `timingName` attribute, such as `firstPaint`, `firstContentfulPaint`, `firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload`. For example, a `PageViewTiming` event may have a `timingName` of `firstPaint` and a `firstPaint` value of `.03`. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard `BrowserInteraction` and `PageView` events.

For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a `pageHide` event before the previous page is shown. Supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the [pageHide event can be found in MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pagehide_event).
