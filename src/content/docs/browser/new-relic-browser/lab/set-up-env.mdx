This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to troubleshoot your web app with New Relic browser. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/lab/over-view/).

</Callout>

Before you can walk through the lab proper, you need to spin up your React application. Here, you:

- Spin up your React application
- Send traffic to your app with a simple load generator

<Steps>

<Step>

Open a terminal window and clone the lab repository.

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/relicstaurants.git
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root directory of your application and switch to the lab directory.

</Step>

<>

```bash
cd relicstaurants
git switch browser-pro-lab-material
```

</>

<Step>


Next, install dependencies, and run the application.

<>

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run newstart
```

</>

This opens your Relicstaurants application in your browser.

<img
  title="Relicstraunts homepage"
  alt="Relicstraunts homepage"
  src={homepage}
/>

Enter your delivery address, and search for restaurants to get started.

<img
  title="Nearby restaurant list"
  alt="Nearby restaurant list"
  src={restaurantList}
/>

Here, you see a list of restaurants where you can order food.

</Step>

<Step>

Choose a restaurant.

<img
  title="Choose a restaurant"
  alt="Choose a restaurant"
  src={chooseRestaurant}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Select an item or two and click on cart.

<img
  title="select food"
  alt="select food"
  src={selectFood}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Click **PAY**.

<img
  title="checkout"
  alt="checkout"
  src={checkout}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Enter the following fake card information and click **Finish payment** to place your order.

<img
  title="place order with fake card"
  alt="place order with fake card"
  src={placeOrder}
/>

Your order is successfully placed.

<img
  title="Purchase completed"
  alt="Purchase completed"
  src={thankYou}
/>

Next, you use a simulator to generate more traffic to your application.

</Step>

<Step>

In another terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your application, and run the load generator.

<>

```bash
# Navigate to the root directiory of your simulator
cd relicstaurants/simulator
# Switch to lab branch
git switch browser-pro-lab-material
[output]
# Install the simulator's dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
[output]
# Run the simulator
python3 simulator.py
[output] ====== WebDriver manager ======
[output] Current google-chrome version is 99.0.4844
[output] Get LATEST chromedriver version for 99.0.4844 google-chrome
```

</>

<Callout variant='important'>

This load generator assumes you have Google Chrome installed on your computer. If you're using a different browser, either skip this step and generate traffic manually, or [install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/).

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Now, that you know how to run your application, it's time to instrument it. In the terminal windows that are running your application and simulator, press `<CTRL-C>` to shut them down. With your app shut down, you'll be able to update your code to introduce monitoring tools.

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to troubleshoot your web app with New Relic browser. Now that you've set up your environment, [instrument your application with browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/lab/install-browser-agent/).
