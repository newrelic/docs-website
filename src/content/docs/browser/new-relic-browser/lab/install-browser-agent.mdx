  This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to troubleshoot your web app with New Relic <InlinePopover type="browser"/>.

  Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [Set up your lab environment](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/lab/set-up-env/), before starting this one.

Your React app is now up and running in the browser. You want to make sure your users always have the best experience on your site. For that, you need insights into your users' experiences, such as their page load times.

To achieve this goal, you need to install our browser agent.

## Install browser agent

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/), and sign in with your account.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    On the right side of the upper navigation bar, click <DNT>**Integrations & Agents**</DNT>.

    <img
      title="Integrations & Agents button in the UI"
      alt="Screenshot of the Integrations & Agents button in the UI"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-add-data.webp"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Scroll down to <DNT>**Browser & mobile**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Browser monitoring**</DNT>.

    <img
      title="Arrow pointing to new relic browser"
      alt="Arrow pointing to new relic browser"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-newrelic-browser.webp"
    />

    The UI will guide you through installing our browser agent.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Select <DNT>**Copy/paste JavaScript code**</DNT> for your deployment method.

    <img
      title="Select deployment method"
      alt="Select deployment method"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-select-deployment-method.webp"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Scroll down to <DNT>**Name your app**</DNT>. Name your app <DNT>**Relicstaurants**</DNT>, and click <DNT>**Enable**</DNT>.

    <img
      title="Enable browser agent for your app"
      alt="Enable browser agent for your app"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-enable-browser.webp"
    />

    This gives you a JavaScript code snippet to enable browser monitoring. Copy it to your clipboard.

    <img
      title="javascript code snippet to enable browser agent"
      alt="javascript code snippet to enable browser agent"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-browser-code-snippet.webp"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Open your app in the IDE of your choice.

    In _public/index.html_ file of your app, paste the copied JavaScript snippet inside the `<head>`.

    ```html lineHighlight=22-23 fileName=public/index.html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
      <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" />
      <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
      <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
      <link

        rel="stylesheet">
      <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
      <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />

      <title>Relicstaurants</title>
        <!--Replace these lines with your 
          browser monitoring code snippet -->
    </head>

    <body>
      <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
      <div id="root"></div>
    </body>

    </html>

    ```

    Your application is now instrumented with our browser agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Restart your application

Now that you've instrumented your application, it's time to restart your local server.

```bash
npm run build
npm run newstart
```

Restart your load generator, as well.

```bash
python3 simulator.py
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Make sure you're running these commands in the correct terminal windows. If you no longer have those windows, follow the steps in the [setup procedure](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/lab/set-up-env).
</Callout>

## View your data

Your app is now sending browser data to New Relic. View this data in New Relic, under <DNT>**Browser**</DNT>.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/) and sign in with your account.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    From the left hand navigation bar, navigate to <DNT>**Browser**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Relicstaurants**</DNT>.

    <img
      title="view relicstraunts"
      alt="view relicstaruants"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-view-relicstaurants.webp"
    />

    Here, you see <DNT>**Page views with JavaScript errors**</DNT>, <DNT>**Core web vitals**</DNT>, <DNT>**User time on the site**</DNT>, <DNT>**Initial page load and route changes**</DNT>, and other performance data from your app.

    <img
      title="view relicstraunts browser app"
      alt="view relicstaruants browser app"
      src="/images/browser-lab-screenshot-relicstaurants-browser-app.webp"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've instrumented your application to send browser data to New Relic using our browser agent. You also see your performance data in New Relic. Next, you use this data to troubleshoot front-end errors with your site.
