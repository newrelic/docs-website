Our [<InlinePopover type="browser"/>](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser) provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does **not** record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so.

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).

## Reported data [#data]

Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It <DNT>**only**</DNT> reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to [Pro features](http://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring/pricing). You can also [enable functionality](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/welcome-new-relic-browser/new-relic-browser#enhanced-features) for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces.

For most data types, browser [transmits the data securely](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-page-load-timing#transmission) using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's [collectors](/docs/accounts-partnerships/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector) by using either of the domains `bam.nr-data.net` or `bam-cell.nr-data.net`.

Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="page-view-data"
    title="Page view data"
  >
    This data is reported once per page view and consists of:

    * Page load timing data
    * Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission)
    * Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission)
    * Additional custom parameters set by the [browser agent API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api), if set prior to page load

      This information appears on the [<DNT>**Page views**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings.

      Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see [Instrumentation for page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/instrumentation-page-load-timing).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ajax-data"
    title="AJAX timing data"
  >
    When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes:

    * Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs
    * HTTP status code of responses
    * Byte size of request message bodies
    * Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent
    * Timing data for the AJAX transaction
    * Timing data for the AJAX callbacks

      This information appears on the [<DNT>**AJAX**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="js-errors-data"
    title="JavaScript error data"
  >
    When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the [<DNT>**JavaScript errors**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/js-errors-dashboard-examining-errors-over-time).

    For each error, the data includes:

    * Exception class of the error
    * Error message containing arbitrary text
    * Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error

      Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="session-trace-data"
    title="Session trace data"
  >
    When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes:

    * Asset load timing details
    * User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking
    * JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information
    * Triggered Javascript events

      Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the [<DNT>**Session traces**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="spa-data"
    title="SPA data"
  >
    If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change.

    * Browser data for [page views](#page-view-data), [AJAX timing](#ajax-data), [JavaScript errors](#js-errors-data), and [session traces](#session-trace-data)
    * Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes
    * Additional custom parameters added from the [SPA API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/new-relic-spa-api)

      When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the [<DNT>**Page views**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/browser-ui/view-spa-data-new-relic-browser).

      Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see [Instrumentation for page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/instrumentation-page-load-timing).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## URL query strings [#url-strings]

The browser agent uses the HTTP `referer` attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings.

## Visitor's IP address [#visitors-ip]

Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the [`ASN` and `geoID`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/filterable-geography-webpage-metrics-location#metrics) are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic [collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector).

New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected.

## Browser types [#types]

Browser determines the browser type from the `User-Agent` header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data.

This information appears on the selected app's [<DNT>**Geography**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/geography-webpage-performance-location). Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's [<DNT>**Browsers**</DNT> page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/browsers-problem-patterns-type-or-location).

## CDN access [#traces]

Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (`nr.js`) is hosted. The domain name for the file (`js-agent.newrelic.com`) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically.

A `script` tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains `bam.nr-data.net` or `bam-cell.nr-data.net`.

<Callout variant="important">
  If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's [networks](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks) (including `bam.nr-data.net` and `bam-cell.nr-data.net`), browser monitoring will not work.
</Callout>

## Cookies

<Callout variant="important">
  For current agents (version 1217 and higher), usage of cookies has been deprecated.
</Callout>

Browser monitoring creates [cookies](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/new-relic-cookies) in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the [Navigation Timing Specification API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/navigation-timing-api), page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately.

New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the `secure` attribute. This is because page load timing [data transmission](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-page-load-timing#transmission) in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the `secure` flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS.

JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are <DNT>**always**</DNT> transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated.

For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU [GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/), we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our [browser agent v1169 release notes](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1169) for more information.

<Callout variant="important">
  If your site uses [P3P](http://www.w3.org/p3p/), it must be configured to allow these cookies.
</Callout>

## JSONP requests [#jsonp]

Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script `GET`, also known as a JSONP request. The Script `GET` returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.
