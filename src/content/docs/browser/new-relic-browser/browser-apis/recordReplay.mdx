## Syntax

```js
newrelic.recordReplay()
```

Browser API used to force a replay to start recording.

## Requirements

* Browser Pro, or Pro+SPA agent (v1.240.0 or higher)

## Description

`newrelic.recordReplay()` can be called to manually force a replay to begin recording. You must meet the following requirements:

* Account is entitled to record replays
* Session Tracking is Enabled
* Session Trace is Enabled
* Browser mutation observer global is present in the current version of the browser being used
* The Session Replay feature is either normally imported, or set to `autoStart: false` and has already been "started"

If a replay is already in progress, or not all of the above criteria are met, this API method will have no effect.

For information about pausing and resuming a replay, refer to [`newrelic.pauseReplay()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/pauseReplay)

## Use Cases

* You want to manually trigger a replay to record on certain site pages or under certain conditions, regardless of the sampling settings.

## Examples
