<Callout variant="important">
This API will work for any browser edition (Browser Lite, Pro, or Pro+SPA). The configuration required to use this API is not currently connected to the larger deployment system within New Relic.  As such, will only have an effect in Copy/Paste or NPM installations until further changes are made.
</Callout>  



## Syntax

```js
newrelic.start(value: string[]|undefined)
```

Browser API used to start agent features when running in a deferred state

## Requirements

Agent version [1.239.0](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes) or higher.



## Description

Features can be loaded in a `deferred` state, which can be controlled by setting the appropriate features' `autoStart` property to `false` in the configuration block used by the agent. This feature state means events will be observed and stored in the agent, but *will not be harvested to NR1 until told to do so* with the `.start()` API method. See [Feature Names]('#feature-names') for a list of feature names. See [Examples]('#examples') for examples showing how to set features into a deferred state.

Upon executing this function with a valid value, the browser agent will start the relevant features that have been deferred by the `autoStart: false` configuration. If called with no arguments, the method will start all features that have been deferred.
If called with a list of strings representing the feature names, the feature names matching the strings will be started.  See [Feature Names]('#feature-names') for a list of feature names.

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>

        `value`

        _string[]_ OR _null_

      <td>
        Optional. An array of strings relating to a list of features to be started
      </td>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Feature Names
* ajax
* jserrors
* metrics
* page_action
* page_view_event
* page_view_timing

## Use Cases

## Examples

### Loading all features in a deferred state (copy/paste, NPM)
```js
// Change the init portion of the configuration block to add `autoStart: false` to any features desired to load in a deferred state
NREUM.init = {
  // feature configurations
  ajax: {autoStart: false},
  jserrors: {autoStart: false},
  metrics: {autoStart: false},
  page_action: {autoStart: false},
  page_view_event: {autoStart: false},
  page_view_timing: {autoStart: false},
  session_replay: {autoStart: false},
  session_trace: {autoStart: false},
  spa: {autoStart: false},
  // other configurations
  // ...
}
```

### "Starting" a list of deferred features

```js
newrelic.start(['ajax', 'jserrors', 'page_action'])
// ajax, jserrors, and page_action features will now start harvesting
```

### "Starting" all deferred features

```js
newrelic.start()
// all deferred features in the agent will now start harvesting
```
