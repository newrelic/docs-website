## Syntax

```js
newrelic.pauseReplay()
```

Browser API used to force a replay to pause recording.

## Requirements

* Browser Pro, or Pro+SPA agent (v1.240.0 or higher)

## Description

`newrelic.pauseReplay()` can be called to manually force a replay to pause recording.

If a replay is not already in progress, this API method will have no effect.

If the browser session is still valid, you can resume a paused replay by calling the [`newrelic.recordReplay()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/recordReplay) API method.

## Use Cases

* You want to manually trigger a replay to stop recording on certain site pages or under certain conditions, such as a healthcare page, credit card info page, etc.

## Examples

### Forcing a replay to pause recording

```js
newrelic.pauseReplay()
```

### Resuming a paused replay

```js
  newrelic.pauseReplay()
  newrelic.recordReplay()
```
