## Syntax

```
newrelic.interaction()
```

Returns a new API object that is bound to the current SPA interaction.

## Requirements

Agent version [nr-963](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes) or higher.

## Description

The [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring) `interaction()` call returns a new API object that is bound to the current interaction.

* **New interaction:** If the API calls it when New Relic is not currently monitoring an interaction, a new interaction is created.
* **New object:** If the API calls it again within the same interaction, a new object referencing the current interaction is created.

## Parameters

The parameters depend on the specific SPA interaction API call.

## Return values

This method returns an API object that is bound to a specific [`BrowserInteraction` event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/explore-data/attributes/browser-default-attributes-insights#browserinteraction-attributes). Each time this method is called for the same `BrowserInteraction`, a new object is created, but it still references the same interaction.

## Examples

SPA API methods can be used on `newrelic.interaction()`. The methods can also be used on a handle you assign with a variable. For example:

```
myInteraction = newrelic.interaction()

myInteraction.save()
```

The named handle can be saved and used from outside an interaction, but methods will have no effect after the interaction has ended.
