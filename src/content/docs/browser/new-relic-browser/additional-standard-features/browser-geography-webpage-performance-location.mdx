Browser monitoring's Geography page provides a world view with color-coded [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) scores and other performance information about your end users' experience. You can [select specific geographic regions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-settings), such as countries or states, and then you can drill down to detailed information about page load performance and historical performance.

## Use page functions [#option]

Use any of our standard [user interface functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/new-relic-user-interface) and [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information.

Here is a summary of additional options with the Geography page:

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Change how the performance data appears
      </td>

      <td>
        Select your choice from the **Sort by** menu.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        * If you have [pre-selected the location from **Application settings**](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-settings), select its tab.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

## View drill-down details [#drilldown]

After you select a specific location, the **Page load performance** page shows:

* Average [page load time](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/page-load-timing-process) in seconds
* Number of page views and [active sessions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/session-tracking) as pages per minute (**ppm**)
* Recent [browser traces](/docs/apm/traces/browser-traces/browser-traces) if applicable

In addition, the **Historical performance** page shows comparison data for the selected [time period](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data), yesterday, and last week for the selected location. This includes:

* Response time
