<Callout variant="important">

Hello! This page is only here for usability testing. It repeats some real page content, but it also contains some obvious, intentional errors. Thanks for bearing with us.

</Callout>

Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue.

- Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it?
- Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else?

## More than Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks.

With Browser Monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app.

But Browser goes far beyond the initial page load to measure [full page life cycle data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process). For example, our Browser UI shows you:

- Actual performance data, such as by [page view popularity](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/page-views-insights-your-sites-popularity) and [user satisfaction (Apdex)](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) scores
- [Perceived performance data](#pageviewtiming) that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display
- [JavaScript error analytics](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/js-errors-dashboard-examining-errors-over-time), stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself
- [Session performance](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle) with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle
- [AJAX requests](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls) indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage
- Hash-based route changes in apps with [single-page application (SPA)](#spa) architectures

These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack.
