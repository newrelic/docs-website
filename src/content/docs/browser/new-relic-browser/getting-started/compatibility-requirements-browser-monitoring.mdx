Browser monitoring includes [strict security measures](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/performance-quality/security-new-relic-browser) to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you [install the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/adding-apps-new-relic-browser), make sure your system meets these requirements.

Want to try out our browser monitoring agent? [Create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)... It's for free, forever! No credit card required.

## Basic requirements [#requirements]

To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements:

1. The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies.
2. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features.

<Callout variant="important">
  Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the [Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list](https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection/blocked) for [Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/69.0/releasenotes/), you will need to change the default configuration.
</Callout>

Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example:

* Hybrid mobile applications
* Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances

For more information, review the [instrumentation for browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring) documentation, and verify [end-user network access](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation#manual_network_access).

## Browser types [#browser-types]

The browser agent officially supports the following browser versions:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (previous 5 major versions)
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (previous 10 major versions)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) (previous 10 major versions)
* [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/adge) (previous 10 major versions)

Instrumentation and specific features may be compatible with other browsers or versions. 

The user interface is compatible with [New Relic's supported browser versions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/supported-browsers-new-relics-ui).

## APM agents [#apm-agents]

You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the [installation procedures](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/adding-apps-new-relic-browser).

If you're deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring:

* [C SDK](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-sdk-release-notes): Version 1.0.0 or higher
* [Go](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes): Version 2.5.0 or higher
* [Java](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes): Version 3.4.0 or higher
* [.NET](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes): Version 2.20.25.0 or higher
* [Node.js](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes): Version 1.4.0 or higher
* [PHP](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes): Version 4.4.5.35 or higher
* [Python](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes): Version 2.10.1.9 or higher
* [Ruby](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes): Version 3.7.0.177 or higher

## Supported frameworks [#frameworks]

The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level "primitives" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework.

      <td>
        If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our [SPA monitoring features](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring), note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent **must** be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Cypress.io
      </td>

      <td>
        Browser is unable to properly instrument the `open` and `send` methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown:

        ```
        Cannot set property 'status' of undefined
        ```

        This will only affect customers running tests with the browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected.

      </td>

      <td>
        This library is not compatible with our [Pro+SPA agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types) due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the [Pro agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types).

## Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations [#csp]

In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline [JavaScript snippet](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/instrumentation-page-load-timing). New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities.

[Content Security Policy Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/) adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load.

<Callout variant="important">
  If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organizationâ€™s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent.
</Callout>

When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team.

The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback `default-src` directive (instead of `script-src` and `connect-src`).

<Callout variant="important">
In older browsers `image-src` or requests for images can be a possible exception that should be accounted for.
</Callout>

      </td>

      <td>
        Add to the `script-src` directive or to the fallback `default-src` directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script.

      </td>

      <td>
        Add to the `script-src` directive or to the fallback `default-src` directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `https://bam.nr-data.net`

        `https://bam-cell.nr-data.net`

        <Callout variant="important">
          Add `https://gov-bam.nr-data.net` if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints.
        </Callout>
      </td>

      <td>
        * Add to the `script-src` directive or to the fallback `default-src` directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source.
        * Add to the `connect-src` directive or to the fallback `default-src` directive. The `connect-src` directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.
