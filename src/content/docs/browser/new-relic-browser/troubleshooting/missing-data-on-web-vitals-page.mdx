## Problem

I'm not seeing data in <DNT>**Web vitals**</DNT>.

## Solution

Here are some causes of missing data:

* Your filters are too narrow. Some key attributes are only relevant to certain web vitals. For example, if you filtered by `elementID`, data would only populate for largest contentful paint (LCP) because `elementID` is only applicable to measuring LCP.

* Your browser agent or edition doesn’t collect certain data. To learn about what key attributes the New Relic browser agent collects, see the [browser agent data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?dataSource=Browser+agent).

* Your app can’t send `PageViewTiming` data to New Relic. Web vitals is built on `PageViewTiming` data, so if for some reason your app is unable to send ingest to our collector, data may not appear.
