## Problem

You're not seeing [session traces](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle) for your browser application.

## Solution

If your application is [instrumented with APM](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation) and other [features associated with the Pro browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) are working, follow these steps:

1. Check if you are [using multiple names for your application](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/installation-configuration/using-multiple-names-app). Session traces are written only to the primary application.
2. If you are using multiple names, check your APM application names to verify that the app is listed first.
3. If the application is not listed first, look for session traces in the application name listed first instead.

Other reasons that you may not see session trace data include:

* The end users are not using browsers that support the [Resource Timing API](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).
* The end users cannot post data to the `/resources` endpoint on `bam.nr-data.net`.
