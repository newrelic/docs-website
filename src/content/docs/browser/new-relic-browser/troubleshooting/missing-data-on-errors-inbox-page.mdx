## Problem

I'm not seeing some errors in the <DNT>**Errors Inbox**</DNT> page.

## Solution

The browser agent automatically collects <DNT>**unhandled**</DNT> errors as they bubble up to the page. If you know errors are occurring within your page or application but aren't seeing them in the <DNT>**Errors Inbox**</DNT> page, it's important to check that the errors are being handled by your page or application and not bubbling up to the browser agent. In such scenarios, handled errors can still be observed by utilizing the [`noticeError` API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/noticeerror).
