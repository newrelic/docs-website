metaDescription: Browser call fails with a CORS redirect error message
---

## Problem

A redirected AJAX call is being rejected with a CORS error message, for example:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://my-domain-2/path' (redirected from 
'https://my-domain-1/path') from origin 'https://my-website-domain' has been
blocked by CORS policy: Request header field x-newrelic-id is not allowed by 
Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
```

## Solution

To resolve this error, update your code to make the AJAX call to the new URL provided by the redirect. For more information, see the MDN article [CORS request external redirect not allowed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSExternalRedirectNotAllowed).

## Cause

The browser agent automatically adds custom headers to outgoing same-origin AJAX calls in order to support the [Distributed Tracing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing) feature.

When the server that receives the AJAX call responds with a redirect status code (e.g. 302), the browser will automatically make the same AJAX call to the redirected URL. And if this new URL is on a different origin and the call does not pass the CORS preflight, the browser will fail the call with the error message listed above.
