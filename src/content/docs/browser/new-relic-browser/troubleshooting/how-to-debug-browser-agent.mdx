## Problem

You need to debug an issue with the New Relic Browser Agent and want to to better understand live agent behaviors and data collection.

## Solution

If your application is instrumented with [<InlinePopover type="browser"/>](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation) and you want to inspect agent activity, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>

    ## Enable debug logging [#enable-debug-logging]

    To get more insight into the agent's activity, [enable debug logging](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/browser-logs/get-started/).

    The browser agent emits warning codes using `console.debug`, and this setting will capture those logs to your New Relic browser application, helping you track agent activity and problems.

    ## Inspect agent logs [#inspect-agent-logs]

    To inspect locally, open your browser's developer console and look for `debug` messages prefixed with `New Relic Warning:`. These messages indicate agent issues, tied to known [warning codes](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-browser-agent/blob/main/docs/warning-codes.md).

    To inspect agent logs across all instances of your web application, [check your logs](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/browser-logs/view-browser-logs/logs-of-a-browser-app/) on [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).

    These logs can help you identify known issues with the browser agent and its configuration within your pages.

  </Step>

  <Step>

    ## Monitor network requests [#monitor-network-requests]

    Use the Network tab in your browser's developer tools to monitor requests sent by the agent. Look for calls to domains like `bam.nr-data.net` or `js-agent.newrelic.com`.

    If you see failed requests or errors, check for network issues, ad blockers, or CSP rules that might be interfering with agent communication.

    Expected endpoints under `js-agent.newrelic.com`:
    - PageView: `/`
    - AjaxRequest, BrowserInteraction, PageViewTiming: `/events`
    - PageAction, BrowserPerformance, UserAction, Custom Events: `/ins`
    - Log: `/browser/logs`
    - JavaScriptError, Ajax Timeslice Metrics: `/jserrors/`
    - SessionReplay, SessionTrace: `browser/blobs`

  </Step>

  <Step>

    ## Use inspection events for troubleshooting [#use-inspection-events]

    The agent emits inspection events that can be captured for deeper troubleshooting. To listen for these events, you can add a listener in your console:

    ```js
    document.addEventListener('newrelic', function(e) {
      console.log('NR Inspection Event:', e.detail);
    });
    ```

    This will log inspection events emitted by the agent, providing details about feature status, errors, lifecycles, harvesting and configuration.

    **Note:** Inspection events are available in agent versions 1.285.0 and higher. Inspection events are emitted immediately upon creation in the agent, any events emitted by the agent before the above event listener is created on the end-user machine will be missed.

  </Step>
