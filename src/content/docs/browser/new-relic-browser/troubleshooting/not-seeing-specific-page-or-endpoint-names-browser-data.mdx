## Problem

You're looking for performance breakdowns for specific pages or endpoints on the Browser [**Page views** UI page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/page-views-insights-your-sites-popularity) or [**AJAX** UI page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls), but the UI doesn't show the URL group you're looking for, or it only shows `/` and `/*`.

## Solution

Browser monitoring automatically "learns" to group your page views when your application is first deployed, and it adds that information to an [allow list for URLs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls), but this grouping may not match your current page view information.

Manage your application's URL segment list [settings](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-apdex-geography#enabling) by [editing existing rules](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls#maintaining) or by [adding the domains and URL segments](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls#adding) that make up your site's URLs. After you add the necessary rules, you should see a useful breakdown of your information from the **Page views** page.

Here are some useful tips:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Adding segments to your allow list**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Tip**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use constant URL segments.
      </td>

      <td>
        Add only URL segments that remain constant across many page views. Do not add unique segments such as IDs or highly-specific categories, because this can lead to [metric grouping issues](/docs/features/metric-grouping-issues).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Enter exact matches.
      </td>

      <td>
        Enter any URL segments as exact matches, including case.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Use existing rules.
      </td>

      <td>
        If a rule already appears for a domain:

        1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Segment allow lists**.
        2. Rather than creating a new rule, edit the existing rule, and add the domain to the UI's **Allow listed segments** field.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Group sub-domains.
      </td>

      <td>
        Group similar sub-domains such as `foo.domain.com` and `bar.domain.com` under `*.domain.com`. This grouping must occur just before the top-level domain name.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Set up single-page apps.
      </td>

      <td>
        If your site is a single-page application and you only see `/` under page views, then your grouping is working correctly. New Relic records subsequent requests as AJAX loads, and your [**AJAX** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls) will contain more detailed information. If it does not, then follow the tips in this document.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Remove rules when appropriate.
      </td>

      <td>
        If you need to remove a rule, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/).
      </td>
    </tr>
