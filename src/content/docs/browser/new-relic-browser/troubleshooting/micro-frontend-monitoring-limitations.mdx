While micro frontend monitoring provides powerful capabilities for tracking individual components, it has specific limitations and scenarios where it may not be the ideal solution. Understanding these constraints helps you make informed decisions about when and how to implement micro frontend monitoring.

## Agent and infrastructure limitations [#agent-limitations]

### Browser agent requirements [#agent-requirements]

Micro frontend monitoring requires specific agent configurations of note:

- **Pro or Pro+SPA agent only**: Lite browser agent doesn't support the `register` API
- **Single container agent**: Only one main browser agent should run on a single page
- **Minimum version requirement**: Browser agent version 1.302.0 or higher
- **License key permissions**: Each micro frontend uses the licensekey and account ID of the container agent. Cross-account entity creation is not currently supported.

```js
// This will do nothing when used with the Lite agent
const mfeAgent = window.newrelic.register({
  id: 'my-component',
  name: 'My Component'
});
```

### Cross-origin limitations [#cross-origin]

Micro frontends loaded on cross-origin iframes face additional constraints:

- **iframe communication**: Limited ability to access parent `window.newrelic` object
- **CORS restrictions**: Cross-origin requests may not be properly attributed
- **Cookie limitations**: Session tracking across origins may be incomplete
- **Security policies**: CSP restrictions may block agent communication

```js
// This pattern won't work in cross-origin iframes
try {
  const mfeAgent = parent.window.newrelic.register({
    id: 'cross-origin-widget',
    name: 'External Widget'
  });
} catch (error) {
  // SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "https://widget.external.com" 
  // from accessing a cross-origin frame.
  console.error('Cross-origin access blocked:', error);
}
```
A container agent can be added to each iframe to help facilitate these constraints.
## Data and billing implications [#data-billing]

### Entity proliferation [#entity-proliferation]

Each registered micro frontend creates a separate browser entity, which can lead to:

- **Increased entity count**: May impact organization and navigation in New Relic
- **Data fragmentation**: Performance data spread across multiple entities

### Data duplication costs [#data-duplication]

When data duplication is enabled at the container, it increases data ingest:

```js
window.NREUM.init.api = {
  duplicate_registered_data: true
};

// Every micro frontend event now sends events to two entities:
// 1. The micro frontend entity
// 2. The container entity
```

### Limited retroactive analysis [#retroactive-analysis]

Micro frontend monitoring only captures data after registration:

- **No historical data**: Can't retroactively analyze performance before implementation
- **Migration gaps**: Switching from mature traditional monitoring to a new system can create data discontinuity in the early stages
- **Baseline establishment**: Requires time to establish performance baselines

## Functional limitations [#functional-limitations]

### Features dependent on container agent [#container-dependencies]

The container agent acts as the "gate keeper" of the page, and as such micro frontends will inherit the limitations of the container agent:

- **Feature availability**: If container agent lacks a feature, micro frontends can't use it
- **Configuration inheritance**: Container agent settings override micro frontend implementations
- **Session management**: Session boundaries are defined by the container, not individual micro frontends

```js
// If container agent has errors disabled, noticeError will not work
const mfeAgent = newrelic.register({
  id: 'my-component',
  name: 'My Component'
});

// This call will do nothing if container is not recording logs
mfeAgent.log('A test message');
```

### Limited automatic instrumentation [#limited-auto-instrumentation]

Unlike full browser agents, micro frontend monitoring requires manual instrumentation

### Relationship mapping limitations [#relationship-limitations]

Entity relationships have constraints:

Entities and relationships are automatically created only when data is collected.  Even after registration, if your micro frontend does not harvest any data to New Relic, no entity or relationship will be created.

Understanding these limitations helps you implement micro frontend monitoring effectively while planning for additional observability tools where needed. The key is choosing the right combination of monitoring approaches for your specific architecture and business requirements.
