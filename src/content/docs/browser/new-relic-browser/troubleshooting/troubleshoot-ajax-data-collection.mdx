## Problem

You are not seeing [AJAX data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-page-identifying-time-consuming-calls) for your Browser application.

## Solution

If your application is [instrumented with Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation) and is correctly collecting other [Browser Pro data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features), follow these steps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="verify-xmlhttp"
    title="1. Verify you use XMLHttpRequest."
  >
    Check whether your application uses the [`XMLHttpRequest` object](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/) to make AJAX calls.

    * Browser monitoring: Other methods (including the newer [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)) currently are not supported when using New Relic Browser Pro.
    * Single-page app monitoring: Fetch is supported for AJAX requests within a [Browser Interaction](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/understand-spa-data-collection#browser-interaction) when using New Relic's [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring).

    If you are making requests using [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP), see [JSONP requirements](#jsonp).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="verify-instrumentation"
    title="2. Verify the object is instrumented."
  >
    If you are using `XMLHttpRequest`, use your browser's dev console to verify that the object has been instrumented by New Relic. Enter the object name at your console.

    If instrumentation has succeeded, the console should return something like:

    ```
    function (t){var e=new p(t);try{u.emit("new-xhr"...
    ```

    If instrumentation failed, you will see something like:

    ```
    function XMLHttpRequest() { [native_code] }
    ```

    If you see this type of failure response, see [Troubleshooting Browser monitoring installation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation). If you see a different response, you may be using another script or library that is conflicting with New Relic instrumentation. Contact support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="verify-network-access"
    title="3. Verify network access."
  >
    If the object is properly instrumented, try triggering an AJAX call in your application while monitoring network traffic in the browser's developer tools. Wait up to one minute, and look for a call to `bam.nr-data.net/jserrors` with an `xhr` parameter. If the call fails, check for network issues.

    If you don't see this call, if it fails with an error not related to network access, or if it succeeds but you still aren't seeing data, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

</CollapserGroup>

If your requests use JSONP, see requirements and notes on functionality below:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="jsonp"
    title="JSONP requirements"
  >
    If your requests use [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP), these requests will not appear on the [AJAX UI page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-page-identifying-time-consuming-calls). However, you can view them as assets within Browser's [session traces](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle). If using SPA monitoring, you can view them on the **Breakdown** tab of the **Page views** page.

    Requirements for JSONP to be recognized by Browser:

    * Each JSONP request must use a unique callback function. Most popular libraries (e.g. jQuery) generate a unique callback function dynamically for each request.
    * The query string callback must be named `"callback"` or `"cb"` in order to be recognized by New Relic. This is the default behavior in most popular libraries.
