Use the RegisteredEntity interface to monitor individual micro frontends within your JavaScript application. After installing the browser agent in your container application, each micro frontend can register itself to report data under its own browser entity in New Relic.

## Before you begin [#before-you-begin]

This guide assumes you have:

- A container application with the browser agent already installed and initialized using the NPM package
- Micro frontends that need individual monitoring
- Admin access to create browser entities in New Relic

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you haven't installed the browser agent in your container application yet, see [Install browser monitoring using NPM](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#npm) for complete installation instructions.
</Callout>

## How the RegisteredEntity class works [#how-it-works]

The RegisteredEntity interface allows micro frontends to:

1. Conduct a safety check to ensure the container agent exists on the page before trying to execute business logic
2. Register with the main browser agent running in the container application
3. Report data under their own browser entity in New Relic
4. Maintain their own custom attributes and context
5. Track lifecycle events and performance independently from the main page

## Register a micro frontend [#register]

Once the main browser agent is initialized in your container application, each micro frontend can register itself using the `register()` method:

```js
  import { RegisteredEntity } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/interfaces/registered-entity'

  const mfeAgent = new RegisteredEntity({
    id: '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    name: 'Shopping Cart MFE'
  });
  
  // Now use the registered agent for this micro frontend
  mfeAgent.addPageAction('foo', {
    bar: 'baz'
  });
```

### Registration parameters [#registration-params]

The `register()` method accepts an object with these properties:

- `id` (required): A unique identifier for the micro frontend
- `name` (required): A human-readable name for the micro frontend

## RegisteredEntity API methods [#api-methods]

The registration returns an object with the following scoped methods:

- [`addPageAction()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/addpageaction) - Record custom page actions specific to your micro frontend
- [`addRelease()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/addrelease) - Track deployments and releases for your micro frontend
- [`deregister()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/deregister) - Unregister the micro frontend when it unmounts or is no longer needed. Timings describing the lifecycle of your micro frontend will be automatically tabulated based on the usage of this API.
- [`interaction()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/interaction) - Access the SPA interaction API for custom timing
- [`log()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/log) - Capture log messages scoped to your micro frontend
- [`measure()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/measure) - Create custom performance measurements
- [`noticeError()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/noticeerror) - Manually capture errors with micro frontend attribution
- [`recordCustomEvent()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/recordcustomevent) - Record custom events for analytics
- [`setApplicationVersion()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/setapplicationversion) - Track the specific version of your micro frontend
- [`setCustomAttribute()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/setcustomattribute) - Add custom attributes that apply to all data from this micro frontend
- [`setUserId()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/setuserid) - Associate a user ID with this micro frontend's data

Each of these methods works identically to the standard browser agent APIs, but automatically scopes all collected data to your micro frontend entity.

## Best practices [#best-practices]

- **Initialize early**: Register micro frontends as soon as they mount to capture all events and best represent [lifecycle timings](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/npm-package/micro-frontend-performance-timing)
- **Use consistent IDs**: Keep micro frontend IDs stable across deployments for consistent tracking
- **Set context attributes**: Use `setCustomAttribute()` to add attribution to all events captured by the registered entity
- **Clean up**: Track unmount events to fully understand the micro frontend [lifecycle timings](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/npm-package/micro-frontend-performance-timing)

### Error handling [#error-handling]

The RegisteredEntity interface handles cases where the main agent might not be available:

```js
  import { RegisteredEntity } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/interfaces/registered-entity'

  const mfeAgent = new RegisteredEntity({
    id: '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    name: 'Shopping Cart MFE'
  });
  
  // If the container agent was not available at registeration time, all API methods will safely no-op without throwing errors
  mfeAgent.addPageAction('foo', {
    bar: 'baz'
  });
```

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

**Data not appearing in New Relic**

Check that:
- The `id` and `name` parameters are stable and provided as expected
- Events are being sent using the registered agent instance, not the main agent
