Browser monitoring's session traces provide a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. Page load timing, individual asset loads, user interactions, AJAX requests, callbacks, errors, and other events appear in an interactive timeline which includes a detailed waterfall visualization, a heat map overview, and highlighted metrics and problems related to that session.

## Identify problems and solutions [#benefits]

Session traces help you understand:

* How users experience your [page load](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process), including time to DOM load, time waiting for AJAX requests to complete, and the user's interactions with the page
* How the New Relic metrics reflect your end users' experiences
* What is the sequence of [JavaScript](#slow-javascript-execution) and browser events, which take longer than others, and when each event occurs
* Where bottlenecks occur, and what may be causing them
* Why one page load may be slower than others, by providing the context for individual events during a session

By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, this detailed and intuitive visualization of all events in the user's session can help pinpoint problem areas and easily identify solutions.

## Requirements

To use browser session traces feature, make sure you meet these requirements:

* Requires the [Pro or Pro+SPA agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#agent-types)
* Your [agent version](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/welcome-new-relic-browser/compatibility-requirements) must support browser monitoring.
* If you're using [multiple names for an app](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app), session traces will only report to the [most specific application](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app#most-least-specific).


Browser randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the [Resource Timing API](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).

## Select a session trace [#index]

The **Session traces** index lists the most recent traces based on the time picker selection for the selected app. Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour.

You can page through up to 500 traces at a time. Additionally, you can sort and search the list by attributes, including:

* Full URL, with query string parameters removed
* Browser type
* Started at date/time
* Page load time

To select a specific session trace:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and click Browser > (select an app) > Session traces**.
2. To locate a session trace from a different date or time period, use the [time picker](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data/).
3. To limit the index to a specific type of trace, use the search window.
4. To view detailed information, select the session trace's link.

## View session trace details [#dashboard]

The **Session trace** details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle.

For apps that have been [deployed using the copy/paste method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser), browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process). This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection.

You can view detailed information about how this "back end" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events.

## Session segment definitions [#segment-defs]

Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the **Session traces** page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if `Page Load` is `0.202s`, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>

## Slow JavaScript execution and repainting [#slow-javascript-execution]

Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions.

Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.
