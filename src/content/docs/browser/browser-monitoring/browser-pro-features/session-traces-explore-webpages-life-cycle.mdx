Our browser monitoring's **Session traces** UI provides a detailed timeline of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle, for as long as ten minutes. After you select the session URL or trace ID, you can use the detailed waterfall visualization and heat map overview to examine metrics and identify problems related to:

* Page load timing
* Individual asset loads
* User interactions
* AJAX requests
* Callbacks
* Errors and other events during the session

## Identify problems and solutions [#benefits]

</figcaption>

Session traces help you understand:

* What is your users' [page load](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) experience? How long does it take for DOM processing or AJAX requests to complete?
* What Core Web Vitals data indicate problems with your users' interactions with the page? Are there performance issues with largest contentful paint (how quickly your page content loads), first input delay (how quickly the browser can respond to user input), or cumulative layout shift (how unstable is the content being loaded)?
* What is the sequence of [JavaScript](#slow-javascript-execution) and browser events? Which ones take longer than others? When does each event occur?
* What patterns emerge by sorting or filtering the errors?
* Do errors increase based on the browser type (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) or device type (desktop, tablet, mobile)?
* Where do you notice bottlenecks? What may be causing them?
* Why is one page load slower than others? What is the context for individual events during a session?

By connecting performance to user experience and interactions to performance, the ability to see all events in the user's session can help you pinpoint problem areas and identify solutions.

## Get started [#requirements]

To use our session traces feature, make sure that you are using the [Pro or Pro+SPA agent type](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#agent-types) for browser monitoring. If you're using [multiple names for an app](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app), session traces will only report to the [most specific application](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app#most-least-specific).

Browser monitoring randomly captures traces only from browsers that support the [Resource Timing API](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). Session traces are randomly sampled and stored at a rate of 90/hour. You can page through up to 500 traces at a time.

## Select a session trace [#index]

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Session traces**: Search by URL or session trace ID, then click the link to use the interactive session trace details.
</figcaption>

To select a specific session trace:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select a browser app) > Session traces**.
2. To limit the index to a specific URL or session trace ID, use the search window.
3. To look for other patterns, change the sort order on any column.
4. To view detailed information, click the session trace link.

## View session trace details [#dashboard]

The **Session trace** details page provides summary information about the trace, a heat map with timing details, and a waterfall of events that you can explore. The color-coded legend identifies the page load events during the webpage's life cycle.

For apps that have been [deployed using the copy/paste method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser), browser monitoring includes web app and queue time in Network time as part of the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process). This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection.

You can view detailed information about how this "back end" time breaks down from the browser's point of view. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser spends time on DNS lookups and other network events.

To navigate through a session trace, explore the waterfall chart by scrolling vertically through the event stack, or select individual events to view their details.

      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

## Session segment definitions [#segment-defs]

Important session trace measurements are displayed in the upper right corner of the **Session traces** page. The first four measurements represent how long into a session that the segment ended. For example, if `Page Load` is `0.202s`, that means that the page load event completed 0.202 seconds after the request began.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Session segment
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Backend
      </td>

      <td>
        The time from when the request began to when backend activity finished and DOM loading began.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        DOM processing
      </td>

      <td>
        The time from when the request began to when DOM processing finished.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>

      <td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        First interaction
      </td>

      <td>
        The time from when the request began to when the first user activity, like a mouse click or a scroll, was recorded.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Duration
      </td>

      <td>
        The total duration of the session.

## Slow JavaScript execution and repainting [#slow-javascript-execution]

Session traces help you identify callbacks in your JavaScript code that execute slowly and block the execution of subsequent calls on the browser's main thread. These calls should execute quickly in order to allow the browser to quickly repaint the page in response to user actions.

Session traces highlight any callbacks longer than 33ms. If called in rapid succession (such as inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop), callbacks longer than 33ms reduce the frame rate below 30 frames per second. This speed seems sluggish to users.
