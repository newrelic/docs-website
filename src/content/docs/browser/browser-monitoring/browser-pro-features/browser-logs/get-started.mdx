### Prerequisites

* A **Pro** or **Pro + SPA** browser agent

<Callout variant="important">
  Automatic log detection is not available for the Lite browser agent.
</Callout>

## Enable automatic log collection (For Existing Browser Apps) [#enable-automatic-log]

To enable automatic log collection for an existing browser app:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Browser**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Select your browser app.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the left-hand menu, click **Application settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Ensure the **Pro** or **Pro + SPA** browser agent is selected.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Toggle **Browser Logs** to **ON**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Toggle the required verbosity level to **ON**, you can choose from:
    
      * **Error**
      * **Warn**
      * **Info**
      * **Debug**
      * **Trace**
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Edit the sampling rate to specify the percentage of user sessions for which to collect logs. You can enter a value between 0 and 100.
  
    <Callout variant="important">
        * Logs sampling is coordinated with other sampling decisions to maximize data collection for the same session. For example, if you set the logs sampling rate to 5% and your Session Replay (SR) sampling rate to 10%, then:
          * Roughly 5% of your sessions will have both Logs and SR collected.
          * Roughly 5% of your sessions will have only SR data collected.
          * The remaining sessions will have neither.
        * For any new browser apps you create, automatic log collection is enabled by default with a warn verbosity level and a sampling rate of 10%.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>
