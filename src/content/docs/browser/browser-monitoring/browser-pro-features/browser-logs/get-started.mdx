## Automatically detect browser logs [#automatic-log]

Auto logging collects log messages issued from the browser `console` to help you maximize observability of your front-end applications.

Browser logs are tracked by default at the `WARN` level for Pro and Pro+SPA agents, but unavailable for the Lite browser agent. We recommend that you first confirm you're using the `Pro or Pro+SPA agent`. 

### How browser auto-logging works 

Based on logging levels and sampling rates set in the configuration, auto-instrumentation of browser logs will attempt to collect messages from the following methods:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
        Method
      </th>

      <th>
        Level
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        console.log
      </td>
      <td>
        `INFO`
      </td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        console.error
      </td>
      <td>
        `ERROR`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        console.warn
      </td>
      <td>
        `WARN`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        console.info
      </td>
      <td>
        `INFO`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        console.debug
      </td>
      <td>
        `DEBUG`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        console.trace
      </td>
      <td>
        `TRACE`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

By default, logging data is stored for 30 days, but actual data retention depends on your account.

### Prerequisites

* A **Pro** or **Pro + SPA** browser agent:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
          Agent version
        </th>
        <th>
          Configuration behavior
        </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          `1.283.0 - 1.305.0`
        </td>
        <td>
          Application settings are applied to both console and manual logs
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          `1.306.0` and above
        </td>
        <td>
          Console logs and manual logs have separate settings for verbosity, sampling, and enable/disable controls
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Enable automatic log collection (For existing browser apps) [#enable-automatic-log]

Enhance your application's observability and debugging capabilities by following these simple setup instructions.

<Steps>

  <Step>
    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Browser**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Select your browser app.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the left-hand menu, click **Application settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Ensure the **Pro** or **Pro + SPA** browser agent is selected.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Toggle **Automatically collect console logs** to **ON**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Edit the sampling rate to specify the percentage of user sessions to collect logs. You can enter a value between 0 and 100.
  
    <Callout variant="important">
        The default sampling rate for browser logging is set to 100% of user sessions. You can set this session sampling rate anywhere between `0%` to `100%`. For example, setting the session sampling rate to `50%` will result in log event collection from approximately half of randomly selected user sessions.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Toggle the required verbosity level to **ON**. The default verbosity level is set to **WARN**. The levels you can choose from:

      * `ERROR`
      * `WARN`
      * `INFO`
      * `DEBUG`
      * `TRACE`

      <Callout variant="important">
        Data passed through the console methods may go through serialization and [obfuscation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/obfuscate-browser-agent-data). Depending on the size and frequency, this may negatively impact application performance as well as data costs. In general, it is NOT recommended to pass in large objects or large amounts of data into console methods.
      </Callout>
  </Step>

## Disable browser logs [#disable-browser-logs]

To disable browser logs for an existing browser app:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Browser**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Select your browser app.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the left-hand menu, click **Application settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Toggle **Automatically collect console logs** to **OFF**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data consumption 

Logs follow the same consumption pricing as your other browser bytes. The amount of bytes produced depends on the count and length of messages.

The auto logging feature eliminates the need to call the `newrelic.log` or `newrelic.wrapLogger` browser APIs, except when adding custom attributes to logging events.
