When enabled, the session replay feature might not display replay data for iframe content. This limitation results from the session replay's behavior in iframe scenarios, which varies based on the iframe's origin and the browser agent's placement.

Assume a webpage contains a top-level window and a child `iframe`. The session replay behaviors, based on the placement of the browser agent, are as follows:   

  * **Same-origin iframes**:
    * With the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay records both the window and the `iframe` content.
    * With the browser agent solely in the `iframe`, session replay records only the content within the `iframe`.
    * With the browser agent in both the top-level window and the `iframe`, session replay records each context independently, resulting in two distinct sessions.
  * **Cross-origin iframes**:
    * With the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay captures only the window content; the `iframe` content will not be visible in the replay.
    * With the browser agent in the iframe, session replay captures only the `iframe` content.


**Limitations:**

* Session replay does not support `<frame>` elements.
