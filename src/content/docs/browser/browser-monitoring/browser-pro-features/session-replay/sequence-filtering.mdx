The **Sequence Filtering** feature helps you to filter session replays based on a specific sequence of events recorded during user interactions. This functionality is designed to help you to efficiently navigate through numerous session recordings on the **Session Listing** page, making the search for relevant replays seamless.

## Key Features

* **Event sequence filtering**: You can filter replays by specifying a sequence of events in a particular order, such as a user performing a search followed by adding an item to their cart.
* **Customizable filters**: You can select attributes, operators, and values to define their sequence filters.
* **Support for multiple actions**: You can specify up to five actions in a sequence.
* **Flexible filtering**: Filters can be applied in any order, allowing you to combine sequence filters with other filter types such as duration.

## Personalize the view

By default, the **Sequence** is set to **All**. You can personalize the view by selecting the **Sequence = All** filter and clicking on the **Set up a filtering sequence** dialog to define their sequence filters.
