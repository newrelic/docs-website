This document provides information on how you can use session replays for in-depth analysis to efficiently investigate and understand user behavior. You can now leverage New Relic AI to automatically summarize session replay event trails, use sequence filtering to pinpoint replays with specific user interaction patterns, and trim recordings to focus on and share the most relevant part of a session with the responsible team or person.

## New Relic AI summary

You can use New Relic AI (NRAI) to help you summarise and map session replay event trail data so that you can better understand errors and successes of your user's browser journey.

To use NRAI to summarize your session replay event trail data, you must have [NRAI enabled](/docs/agentic-ai/new-relic-ai/#enable) for your account. Once NRAI is enabled on your account, perform the following to surface your summary:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser**</DNT>.
2. Select your browser app.
3. In the left-hand menu, scroll down and click <DNT>**Session replay**</DNT>.
4. Click the replay to view session details for the session you would like summarized.

    />

5. Click <DNT>**Summarize**</DNT>. A summary of the session is generated on the focus panel.

## Sequence filtering

The **Sequence Filtering** feature helps you to filter session replays based on a specific sequence of events recorded during user interactions. This functionality is designed to help you to efficiently navigate through numerous session recordings on the **Session Listing** page, making the search for relevant replays seamless.

### Key Features

* **Event sequence filtering**: You can filter replays by specifying a sequence of events in a particular order, such as a user performing a search followed by adding an item to their cart.
* **Customizable filters**: You can select attributes, operators, and values to define their sequence filters.
* **Support for multiple actions**: You can specify up to five actions in a sequence.
* **Flexible filtering**: Filters can be applied in any order, allowing you to combine sequence filters with other filter types such as duration.

### Personalize the view

By default, the **Sequence** is set to **All**. You can personalize the view by selecting the **Sequence = All** filter and clicking on the **Set up a filtering sequence** dialog to define their sequence filters.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Session replay**</DNT>.
2. Select the **Sequence = All** filter, the **Set up a filtering sequence** option appears.
3. The **Set up a filtering sequence** option allows you to create a sequence filter by specifying up to 5 actions in a particular order. You can define the sequence by selecting the following attributes:

  <Callout variant="important">
  You must add at least two steps to the filter form.

## Trimmed Session replay

The **Trimmed Session replay** feature enables you to extract and share specific segments of session recordings, focusing on relevant events for targeted analysis and faster issue resolution. Instead of sharing entire lengthy recordings, you can create focused clips that highlight the exact moments when issues occur.

### Create a trimmed Session replay

2. Open the session replay you want to trim from your session replay list
3. Click **Share a clip** in the session replay controls
4. Select your clip boundaries using the timeline controls:
    - Drag the left arrow to set the start time of your clip.
    - Drag the right arrow to set the end time of your clip.
