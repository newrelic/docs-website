You can use New Relic AI (NRAI) to help you summarise and map session replay event trail data so that you can better understand errors and successes of your user's browser journey.

To use NRAI to summarize your session replay event trail data, you must have [NRAI enabled](/docs/agentic-ai/new-relic-ai/#enable) for your account. Once NRAI is enabled on your account, perform the following to surface your summary:
