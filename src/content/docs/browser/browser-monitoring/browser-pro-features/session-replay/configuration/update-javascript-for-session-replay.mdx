## (For copy/paste deployed agents) Manually update the JavaScript snippet [#update-snippet]

If you use the copy/paste method to deploy your browser agent, you may need to manually update the JavaScript snippet to include session replay capabilities. This update ensures your application is correctly configured to capture and store replay data.

To update your agent code:

    1. Go to the <DNT>**Application Settings**</DNT> page and copy the JavaScript snippet.

       <img
         title="Copy/paste installation method"
         alt="Screenshot of the application settings page."
         src="/images/browser_screenshot-full_Application-settings-page.webp"
       />

    2. Paste it in your code where the old snippet was.

    3. Deploy your app.
