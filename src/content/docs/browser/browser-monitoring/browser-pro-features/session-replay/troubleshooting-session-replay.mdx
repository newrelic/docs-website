Address common issues that may occur during the setup and operation of session replay. From missing replays to display problems, we offer solutions and best practices to ensure your session replay functionality operates smoothly and efficiently.

## Not seeing replays in the UI [#not-seeing-replay]

### Problem

  Session replay feature is enabled, but you're not seeing any replays.

### Solution

  Here are some possible fixes:

    * Check your sampling rates. There is sampling for both replays and errors.
    * Ensure you have permission to view replays.
    * Make sure you're using the Pro or Pro+SPA version of the browser agent. Session replay does not work with the Lite browser agent.
    * Make sure your browser agent meets these requirements:
      * Agent version v1.260.0 or greater. We recommend [upgrading to the latest agent version](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes) as we continue making improvements.
      * Agent type: Pro or Pro+SPA. Session replay does not work with the Lite browser agent.
      * [Session tracing](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle/#requirements) is enabled.
    * Your end-user's browser supports the browser-level APIs needed to record a session replay (verify compatibility at [MutationObserver](https://caniuse.com/mutationobserver)).
    * In [Errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), filter your views so that you always see a replay. By default, browser event data is stored 8 days, but actual data retention depends on your account.
    * If you're using the copy/paste deployment method, make sure you [updated your agent code](#update-snippet).
    * If you’re using the APM deployment method, you may need to wait a while for session replay to be automatically enabled. If you’re still not seeing data, try restarting the agent.
    * If you're [dropping](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/) PageView event data, Session Replays may not display in the UI.

## Replays not displaying correctly [#replays-not-displaying]

### Problem

  You're seeing replays, but they're not displaying correctly.

  This may be because your CSS files are hosted on a separate domain and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) security measures are preventing our agent from accessing the CSS files. This can result in incomplete or inaccurate replays, as essential styling information may be missing.

  Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

    * Session replay works by rebuilding the user's DOM, which includes your website's structure and visual elements. To achieve this, our agent needs to access your CSS files to accurately capture styling information. We then inline these styles directly into the replay recording, eliminating the need to reference the original CSS files during playback.

    * If your CSS files are hosted on a separate domain, CORS may prevent our agent from accessing them.

### Solution

  To ensure your CSS files are accessible, add the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to your `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements within your HTML code. This attribute instructs the browser to allow cross-origin access for those specific CSS files, allowing our browser agent to record and integrate the styling information.

  Here's an example of adding the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute:

```HTML
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets.yoursite.com/styles.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

## Not seeing replays in your iframes [#no-replays-in-iframes]

### Problem
    
  Session replay feature is enabled, but you're not seeing replay data for iframe content.
    
### Solution

  The behavior of session replay in iframe scenarios depends on the origin of the iframe and the placement of the browser agent.
    
  Assuming a web page consists of a top-level window with a child iframe, here are some possible fixes:   
    * **Same-origin iframes**:
      * If you place the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay captures both the window and the iframe.
      * If you place the browser agent in the iframe, session replay only captures what's in the iframe.
      * If you place the browser agent in both the top-level window and iframe, session replay captures what's happening independently in both the window and iframe, resulting in two separate sessions.
    * **Cross-origin iframes**:
      * If you place the browser agent in the top-level window, session replay only captures what's in the window. The iframe will appear blank in session replay.
      * If you place the browser agent in the top-level iframe, session replay only captures what's in the iframe.

  Session replay is **not** compatible with `<frame>` elements.
