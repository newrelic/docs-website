## Introduction to session replay

Session replay captures interactions on your web app and maps other telemetry data to help you understand your user's journeys. Session replay can be used for troubleshooting and improving the end-user experience, such as:

* **Troubleshooting JavaScript errors**: Troubleshoot the cause of an error by seeing what the user was doing when the error occurred. For example, if an end user receives an error while trying to complete an ecommerce transaction, you can use session replay to see which steps they took and what data they entered before the error occurred. This can help you quickly identify and fix the root cause of the problem.
* **Improving the user experience**: Discover areas of your web app that are causing users frustration. For example, you might see that users are getting lost in your navigation or clicking on buttons that don't do anything.
* **Identifying issues in key user journeys**: Identify areas of your web app that are causing performance problems. For example, if session replay reveals the `/cart/checkout` page is experiencing excessive page load time, you'd prioritize fixing this critical user journey.

## How session replay works [#how-it-works]

When a user loads your web page, session replay takes a snapshot of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the page's structure and visual elements. To ensure accurate styling information, the browser agent accesses your CSS files. The agent then integrates these styles directly into the replay recording, eliminating the need to reference external CSS files during playback. As the user interacts with the page, a library within the browser agent captures any changes made to the DOM. This captured data is then stored securely in New Relic's database.

Replays store up to:

* 4 hours of a user session
* 30 minutes of inactivity

By default, browser event data is stored 8 days, but actual data retention depends on your account.

## Manually record session replays [#manual-replays]

If needed, you can programmatically `force` a session replay to start or stop recording using API methods. Here are some use cases:

* Allow users to opt in for interaction recording. For example, if you have a pop-up asking "Allow this session to be recorded for performance analysis?" and a user consents:
  1. Call `newrelic.recordReplay()` to initiate recording.
  2. Once the session is complete or consent is withdrawn, use `newrelic.pauseReplay()` to stop capturing data.
* Record sessions based on specific criteria, such as:
  * Start recording only for sessions on specific URLs such as a product checkout flow.
  * Stop recording for sensitive pages such as `/billing` or `/health-records`.

See the API documentation for instructions:

* [`newrelic.recordReplay`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/recordReplay/)
* [`newrelic.pauseReplay`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/pauseReplay/)

## Disable automatic session replay tracking [#auto-replays]

You can prevent session replays from automatically starting, even when sampled, by setting the API configuration option `autoStart` to `false`. This is useful in scenarios where you need to prioritize specific actions over automatic sampling. For example, you might not want session replays to automatically run on sensitive pages, like HIPAA-compliant ones. In such cases, you can use the `.start()` API to manually trigger the replay feature after user consent is obtained (and your app calls `.start()`)

Setting `autoStart: false` instructs the agent to defer its initialization until explicitly called using `.start()`. This ensures that session replays will not be created at all, even if the backend samples your application for recording.

<Callout variant="important">
  Calling `.start()` does not guarantee that a session replay will be recorded. It simply delays the module import and evaluation of sampling results until this point. If you need to force a recording, see [Manually record session replays](#manual-replays).
</Callout>

To start using this API, see [`newrelic.start`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/start/).

## Use Nerdgraph to configure replay settings [#nerdgraph-mutation]

You can configure session replay settings using our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) instead of using the UI. This method is helpful if you need to make bulk changes, such as applying sampling rates to multiple browser entities.

Here's an example mutation and variables to create a new browser application with default settings:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Mutation
      </th>

      <th>
        Variables
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ```graphql
        mutation SessionReplayConfigUpdate($guid: EntityGuid!, $settings: AgentApplicationSettingsUpdateInput!) {
          agentApplicationSettingsUpdate(guid: $guid, settings: $settings) {
            browserSettings {
              sessionReplay {
                blockSelector

            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json

## Data consumption [#data-consumption]

Session replay follows the same consumption pricing as your other browser bytes. The amount of bytes produced depends on the count, length, and user-activity levels of sessions, as well as the complexity of your site's DOM.

The most accurate way to project your cost per replay is to enable the feature for a short test period and measure your actual consumption. Alternatively, you can use an average of 5.3 MB per replay as a rough approximation, though keep in mind that your actual cost may vary significantly. A simple formula to project your approximate costs is: `sessions` x `sampling_rate` x `gb_per_replay` x `cost_per_gb`. Here's an example:

```
1 million (sessions) x 5% (sampling_rate) x 0.0053 (gb_per_replay) x $0.35 (cost_per_gb) = $92.75 for 50,000 replays
```

To control your consumption, [adjust your sampling rates](#configure-sampling-rates).

## User privacy and security concerns [#data-security]

We prioritize data privacy and built session replay with strong default settings to minimize the potential exposure of sensitive customer information. You can further [customize privacy settings](#configure-privacy-settings) to meet your specific needs.

Session replay does not capture screenshots or videos. Instead, it records only the essential DOM state changes needed to reconstruct user interactions. This significantly reduces the amount of data stored.

### Compliance with data privacy laws

New Relic acts as a data processor under GDPR and a service provider under CCPA. This means we process data according to your instructions. Ultimately, compliance with these laws depends on how you implement session replay within your application.

By default, all text and user inputs, including personal data, are masked within the recordings. You can selectively unmask specific elements if needed, but the default ensures that no personally identifiable information is readily visible. This approach provides a strong foundation for data privacy while offering flexibility for your specific needs.

## Session replay and your app's performance [#app-performance]

Session replay minimizes impact on your app's performance with:

* **Minimal initial impact**: Session replay loads asynchronously after full page load, ensuring no interference with early page load performance metrics.
* **DOM mutation tracking**: Once loaded, session replay monitors DOM changes and reports them as compressed payloads. The size of these payloads correlates with the complexity of the DOM tree.
* **Performance optimization techniques**: Payload size can also increase if the DOM is large. However, session replay uses a number of techniques to reduce payload size, such as:
  * GZIP compression
  * Duplication reduction
  * Strategic payload harvesting: It only sends a large (compressed) payload when the full DOM is captured, which typically only happens when the replay feature is first imported. After that, it will only send small payloads that relate to the user's actions. The browser agent will harvest on whatever happens first of the following:
    * The payload reaches more than 64 KB compressed
    * 60 seconds elapses
    * The visibility of the page changes (tab change, focus, navigation, etc)
    * The session ends
