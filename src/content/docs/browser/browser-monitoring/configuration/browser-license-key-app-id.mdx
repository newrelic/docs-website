Some New Relic features require your Browser monitoring license key or your New Relic application ID.

If you use the [copy/paste method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser#copy-paste-app) to add an app to Browser monitoring, your app's [Browser **Settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-browser-monitoring) will show the generated JavaScript snippet. The bottom of the generated JavaScript includes your Browser `licenseKey` (also known as a `browser_monitoring_key`) and `applicationID`.

* The browser monitoring `licenseKey` (`browser_monitoring_key`) is a unique key that is linked to, but is not the same as, the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in Browser monitoring where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key).
* The browser `applicationID` is the unique identification code for each app in Browser monitoring.

To protect the security of your `browser_monitoring_key` and `applicationID`, you can [monitor or block your domain](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/monitor-or-block-specific-domains).

## Get Browser license key and app ID from the UI [#procedures]

This procedure applies **only** when you use the copy/paste deployment method. If you use the [APM app deployment method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser), your **Settings** page will not show the JavaScript snippet.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also [use the New Relic REST API (v2)](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/adding-or-listing-browser-apps-api-v2) or API Explorer to list these values.
</Callout>

When you select anywhere in the JavaScript snippet that appears in the user interface, Browser monitoring automatically selects the entire snippet. The browser monitoring license key and application ID appear near the end of the JavaScript snippet.

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > Settings:** The end of the JavaScript generated for copy/paste deployments includes your browser monitoring license key and application ID.

To obtain only the browser monitoring license key and application ID information:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > Settings**.
2. Select and copy the generated JavaScript, and paste it into a text file.
3. Delete everything in the text file except the browser monitoring license key and app ID information (just above the ending `</script>` tag), and save.

## Create and manage keys [#create-manage]

You can [create additional license keys and manage them using NerdGraph](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-personal-api-keys).
