[Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser)'s **Summary** page summarizes the real-user browser performance of your app. Use the Summary page to:

* View trends in an app's browser-side performance
* Quickly troubleshoot page load timing issues
* Navigate to other browser UI pages

## View the Summary page [#viewing]

To view a summary of browser performance for an app: 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > Browser applications**. Use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) to access all your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements.
2. Alternatively, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click Browser, and select an app from the [Browser index](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-apps-index).
3. From the app's **Summary** page, use [standard New Relic page functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information.

The Summary page includes:

* [Core Web Vitals widgets](#core_vitals)
* [User time on the site](#user_time)
* [Initial page load and route change chart](#page_load)
* [User-centric page load times chart](#user_load)
* [Throughput chart](#throughput-chart)
* [Front end vs. back end chart](#front_vs_back)
* [First interaction by device type, First interaction by user agent, JavaScript errors, and Longest first input delay by URL](#other-charts)
* [Related Entities widget](#related_entities)
* [View Synthetics monitors](#synthetic_monitors)

## Core Web Vitals widgets [#core_vitals]

The **Core Web Vitals** widgets show how your browser performs according to Google's [Core Web Vitals](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details). The Core Web Vitals widgets include:
  - LCP - Largest Contentful Paint
  - FID - First Input Delay
  - CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift

## User time on the site [#user_time]

The **User time on the site** widget shows the time a user remains on the site.

## Initial page load and route change chart [#page_load]

The **Initial page load and route change** chart shows the load time of a traditional URL change stemming from a load or reload of a URL. This chart appears with more detail about the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) on the [page load time page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard).

## User-centric page load times chart [#user_load]

The **User-centric page load times** chart shows the load time of a page for a user. This chart appears with more detail about the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) on the [page load time page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard).

## Throughput chart [#throughput-chart]

The **Throughput** chart displays browser throughput as pages per minute (ppm). The value in the upper right of the chart is the average value for the selected time range.

If you have enabled [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring) enabled and the **Summary** page shows the **SPA load time** chart, the **Throughput** chart will also use SPA data.

<Callout variant="tip">
  App server requests per minute (rpm) may show a different measurement than the browser [page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/page-load-timing-process)'s pages per minute (ppm).
</Callout>

## Front end vs. back end chart [#front_vs_back]

The **Front end vs. back end** chart links to the connect APM service application. For details on APM and tracing, see [Language agents and distributed tracing](docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing).

## First interaction by device type, First interaction by user agent, JavaScript errors, and Longest first input delay by URL [#other-charts]

You'll also see summary versions of these metrics from the [page load time page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard) and [JavaScript errors page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-examining-errors-over-time):

* **First interaction by device type**
* **First interaction by user agent**
* **JavaScript errors**
* **Longest first input delay by URL**

## Related Entities widget [#related_entities]

The **Related Entities** widget shows all the entities that are related to the browser. To understand more about connections between entities, read about [Entity relationships](docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#related-entities).

## View Synthetics monitors [#synthetic_monitors]

The ![View Synthetics monitors button](./images/view_synthetic_monitors.png "view_synthetic_monitors") button directs you to the **Synthetics** page. To read more about Synthetics, see [Synthetic monitoring](docs/synthetics).
