To get started with browser monitoring, you'll need to add a JavaScript snippet, which we call our browser agent, to your webpage HTML. Then the agent will collect browser data like JavaScript errors, core web vitals, and other performance data, and will send that data to New Relic where you can view it in the UI.

Before you add our browser agent to your webpages, you'll first need to make some configurations to the JavaScript snippet to help New Relic identify and connect to your browser app. These configurations must be done in our UI, and at the end you'll inject your customized browser agent and start monitoring your browsr app. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Before you begin 

Review our browser compatibility and requirements for:
  * [SPAs (Single-page applications)](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/spa-compatibility-requirements/)
  * [Non-SPAs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/)

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create a browser app in our UI

First, you'll need to create a browser app in our UI:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Add data**, then under **Data sources** select **Browser monitoring**. 

<img
  title="Add your app"
  alt="Add your browser app in the UI"
  src={browserInstallStep1}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

<Callout variant="tip">

  </Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
### Choose a deployment method [#step-3]

When it comes to deploying the browser agent to your webpages, you have two methods:

* Option 1: Enable via New Relic APM (recommended for non-SPA apps)
  * If you're using an <InlinePopover type="apm" /> (application performance monitoring) agent to monitor the backend-side of your browser app, then you should use this APM option. We recommend this option for non-SPA apps because the APM agent will automatically deploy the browser agent to every page of your website and you'll automatically get the latest version of the browser agent whenever you restart your APM agent.
* Option 2: Copy/Paste JavaScript code (recommended for SPA apps)
  * Use this method if you can't use the first option, due to reasons like you have a SPA app or your APM agent isn't supported for auto-injection ( Node.js, Java agents). If you choose this option, you'll copy the customized JavaScript snippet at the final step in the UI, once all configurations have been made.

In the UI, select one of these deployment options and move on to the next step.

<img
  title="choose a deployment method"
  alt="choose a deployment method"
  src={browserInstallStep2}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
### (Optional) Enable distributed tracing

Next, you can choose to enable distributed tracing to help understand how your app's frontend and backend activity are connected. Read more about distributed tracing [here](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing/).

<img
  title="enable distributed tracing"
  alt="enable distributed tracing"
  src={browserInstallStep3}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
### Name your browser app

When selecting a name for your browser app, you've got two options: 

* Select an existing app already monitored by an APM agent. 
* Create a new name for a standalone browser app. 

Choose one of these options and click **Enable**. 

<img
  title="name or connect an existing browser app"
  alt="name or connect an existing browser app"
  src={browserInstallStep4}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
### (For copy/paste method only) Inject the JavaScript snippet

If you selected the copy/paste option, it's time to add the JavaScript snippet to your browser app's HTML. 

In the UI, copy the JavaScript snippet that's been customized for your app instrumentation, and paste it into the `<head>` tag for your web app. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  The head tag typically handles third party scripts, fonts, etc., that load on all your app pages, so you'll only need to paste it into one place. Make sure to paste it as close to the top of the `<head>` as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as X-UA-Compatible and charset). For more information on the snippet placement, see [JavaScript placement requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).

  The JavaScript snippet is blurred in this screenshot because it contains sensitive data (account ID, license key, etc.). You must copy and paste your own unique JavaScript snippet from the UI.

<Step>
### Generate traffic for your app [#step-6]

Congratulations, you're done installing the browser agent! Now you'll need to generate traffic for your app and wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
Not seeing data? 

It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If you're still not seeing data, check out [common browser installation problems and solutions](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-your-browser-monitoring-installation/).
