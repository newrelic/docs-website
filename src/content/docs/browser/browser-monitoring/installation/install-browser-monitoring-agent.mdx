Browser uses a [JavaScript snippet](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/instrumentation-page-load-timing) (or "agent") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the Browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options.

## Select a deployment option [#options]

No matter which option you use to deploy Browser, the end result is to inject the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the Browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the [Browser **Application settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-apdex-geography) to update settings.

      </td>

      <td>
        You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your [APM **Applications** index](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-your-applications-list).)

      </td>

      <td>
        This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for:

        * Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN
        * APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end)

      <td>
        Enabling SPA requires a **Pro + SPA** subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the Browser JavaScript agent.

      <td>
        The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the Browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Use an [APM agent API](#agent-instrumentation) to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet
      </td>

      <td>
        For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically.

## Enable an APM-monitored app [#select-apm-app]

Use this procedure to automatically deploy the Browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, select **Browser**, and then select **Add more data**.
2. In the **Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications** section, select the **New Relic Browser** tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click **Continue**.
4. From the **Get started with New Relic Browser page**, in the **Choose a deployment method** section, select **Enable via New Relic APM**.
5. In the **Choose your instrumentation** section, select **Lite**, **Pro**, or **Pro + SPA**.
6. In the **Configure your instrumentation** section, make the selections you want. 
7. In the **Select your application** section, type or use the search window to find an app's name.
8. Click **Enable**.

   <Callout variant="important">
     **Node.js:** To finish enabling the Browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to [insert the JavaScript header](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/new-relic-browser-nodejs-agent) into the beginning of your HTML page's `head` tag.
   </Callout>
6. Generate some traffic for your app.
7. Wait a few minutes for **Browser** to start collecting data, then select your app from the [Browser applications index](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/browser-apps-list).

## Enable with copy/paste [#copy-paste-app]

Use this procedure to insert Browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your Browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/browser-examples-v2) and [API Explorer](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer).
</Callout>

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, select **Browser**, and then select **Add more data**.
2. In the **Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications** section, select the **New Relic Browser** tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click **Continue**.
3. From the **Get started with New Relic Browser page**, in the **Choose a deployment method** section, select **Copy/Paste JavaScript Code**.
4. In the **Choose your instrumentation** section, select **Lite**, **Pro**, or **Pro + SPA**.
5. In the **Configure your instrumentation** section, make the selections you want. 
6. In the **Name your app** section, name your app:

   * If your app is monitored by APM, select **Yes**, then type or use the search window to find the app's name.
   * If you have a standalone app for **Browser** (not monitored by APM), select **No**, then type the app's name.
7. Click **Enable**.
8. A new section, **Instrument the agent**, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the `<head>` element as possible, but after any position-sensitive `<meta>` tags (for example, `X-UA-Compatible` or `charset` information). For more information on the inline `head` placement, see [JavaScript placement requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).
7. Generate some traffic for your app.
8. Wait a few minutes for **Browser** to start collecting data, then select your app from the [Browser applications index](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-apps-index/).

If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's [Browser **Application settings** page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-apdex-geography) or by using the [REST API (v2)](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/adding-or-listing-browser-apps-api-v2).

## Instrument webpages using the APM agent [#agent-instrumentation]

This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM.

New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about Browser's [AJAX calls](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/ajax-dashboard) and [JavaScript errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/javascript-errors-dashboard).

For more information, see the instructions for your agent:

* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/features/install-new-relic-browser-go-apps)
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java)
* [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/features/page-load-timing-net)
* [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-nodejs)
* [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php)
* [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python)
* [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby)

## Troubleshoot Browser agent installation [#troubleshooting]

When you enable Browser Pro features for [session traces](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle), [AJAX calls](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/ajax-dashboard), or [JavaScript errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/javascript-errors-dashboard), it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your Browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the [troubleshooting tips](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring), and restart your agent.
