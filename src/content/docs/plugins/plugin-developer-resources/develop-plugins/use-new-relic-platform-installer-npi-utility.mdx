<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If you’d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

## NPI compatibility requirements [#requirements]

The New Relic Platform Installer (NPI) is a command line utility for plugins in Plugin Central. It allows users to easily download, configure, and manage a plugin by installing it with a single command.

The NPI is available for plugins written with Java or .NET plugin SDKs. If you are a plugin developer, follow these steps to meet the NPI requirements for a consistent installation experience, and publish your plugin in Plugin Central as `NPI Compatible`.

In order to make your plugin NPI-compatible, make sure it meets each of these requirements:

<Table>

    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **NPI compatibility**

        * **.NET:** See the [.NET SDK README file in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic-platform/newrelic_dotnet_sdk) for plugins.

      </td>

      <td>
        Create a `./config` directory containing a `plugin.template.json` file and a `newrelic.template.json` file. Make sure that plugin configuration is read from the `plugin.json` file in the `./config` directory. For more information, refer to the README in GitHub.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Distribution

Once your plugin is NPI-compatible from a code perspective, place it somewhere that is accessible for consumers to download. For example, add the compressed distributable to a `dist` folder in your GitHub repository.

When your plugin is ready for distribution, follow standard procedures to publish it in Plugin Central. Be sure to select the **Platform Installer (NPI)** distribution option.

## NPI command line utility [#npi-utility]

When users select an NPI Compatible plugin from Plugin Central, they also have the option to download the NPI tool. The tool allows users to easily download, configure, and manage a plugin. They can also use a series of commands to manage their plugins or pass the `--help` flag for more information about available options.

## Updates [#updating-npi-plugins]

After you create and publish an NPI-compatible plugin, follow standard procedures to update it as needed. Then, when you publish the updated plugin, the NPI tool automatically will pick up your most current version for users who have installed your NPI-compatible plugin.

## Privately-published plugins [#private-plugins]

In general, the NPI tool will try to pull download (manifest) information from New Relic's Plugins service. You can also provide a file named `manifest.json` in the `config` directory of your NPI installation to provide this information. Use this file format:

```
[
  {
    "guid": "arbitrary_identifier",
    "download_url": "https://plugin.download.url.com",
    "publisher": "New Relic Inc.",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "installer_compatible": true,
    "implementation": "Java"
  }, 
  {
    "guid": "arbitrary_identifier2",
    "download_url": "https://plugin2.download.url.com",
    "publisher": "New Relic Inc.",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "installer_compatible": true,
    "implementation": ".NET"
  }
]
```

After you set this up, you can run all the same commands with your private plugin's GUID.

To `install` or `fetch` a plugin, you must pass the `--untrusted` flag to allow downloading plugins from a local file.
