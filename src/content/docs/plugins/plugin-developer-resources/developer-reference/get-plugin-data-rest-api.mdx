<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.
</Callout>

## Requirements

If you want to use New Relic's [REST API (v2)](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) or the [API Explorer](/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) user interface to get plugin data, you need:

* Your [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key)
* The [product identification code](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/finding-product-id) for your `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`
* Other values as appropriate for your cURL command or API Explorer (v2) request

If you do not know the `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`, you can use the REST API (v2) or API Explorer to [list each plugin](/docs/apm/apis/plugin-examples-v2/getting-list-plugins-api-v2), including its ID, name, GUID, summary metrics, and additional details for each component.
