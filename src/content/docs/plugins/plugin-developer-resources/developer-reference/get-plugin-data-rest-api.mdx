<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If you’d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

## Requirements

If you want to use New Relic's [REST API (v2)](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) or the [API Explorer](/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) user interface to get plugin data, you need:

* Your [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key)
* The [product identification code](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/finding-product-id) for your `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`
* Other values as appropriate for your cURL command or API Explorer (v2) request

If you do not know the `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`, you can use the REST API (v2) or API Explorer to [list each plugin](/docs/apm/apis/plugin-examples-v2/getting-list-plugins-api-v2), including its ID, name, GUID, summary metrics, and additional details for each component.
