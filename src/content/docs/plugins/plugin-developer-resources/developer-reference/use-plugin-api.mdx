<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.
</Callout>

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If you’d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

## Before you begin [#before_you_begin]

Using a development language other than Ruby, .NET, or Java for a plugin agent means you do not have an SDK to work with, but you do have some benefits. This is a guide for plugin developers to get started with writing an agent in any language that can work directly with the Plugin API for Plugin Central.

* You can use any language you want, as long as it supports sending JSON through HTTP POST. This allows for better integration with your systems.
* For the same reason, it is the best option for SaaS-based plugin agents.

However, if you are not using the Plugins SDK for Java. .NET, or Ruby, you have some additional setup and planning to do in developing a plugin agent. This includes:

* Error tracking on POST calls
* A method for tracking and aggregating data when a POST fails
* Your own support plans if a New Relic SDK for your language or development tools is not available

Any publicly available plugins in the Plugin Central should come bundled with their source code if the executable code is not plain text. This allows you to both try out plugins and to review the code.

**Recommendation:** Before authoring a plugin, install some existing plugins using the Java SDK, .NET SDK, or Ruby SDK to see how they are written.

## Metric data POST [#post]

Metric data is sent as an HTTP POST of JSON data using this URI:

```
https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics
```

The MIME-type for the POST is application/json.

The Plugins feature is designed to receive a continuous stream of metrics at a certain maximum speed, and to present this information on useful charts. The recommended frequency for sending data to Plugins is to send 60 seconds worth of data once a minute. Agents sending data more frequently than twice a minute on average may be subject to enforced limits on the number of metrics being saved.

The following are recommended soft limits. Requests smaller than this will work; requests larger than this are subject to rejection or automatic data aggregation. As a hard cap, **the total size of the POST payload should be no larger than 1MB (10^6 bytes).**

If the metric is "expensive" to calculate and does not change quickly, consider writing your plugin agent so that it skips some polling cycles to retrieve data and then sends the last value. This produces better results for your plugin users' dashboards.

        Total number of unique metrics per component. Take precautions to ensure metric names are not generated too dynamically. Even if the number of metrics being sent in each individual post is small, over time they may add up to a large number of unique metrics. When the number of metrics for a given component exceeds this limit, the server may start aggregating metrics together by globbing segments of the metric name with an asterisk (**\***).

      </td>
    </tr>

</Table>

## Data aggregation [#aggregation]

The SDKs manage data aggregation in the event of a failed POST. If you are not using an SDK, you need to manage this yourself.

* Include all five metric values in a POST: min, max, total, count, and sum or squares. (**Exception:** This may not be necessary for monotonic metrics where short term variation is not an issue.)
* Recompute these values for the accumulating metric data as required by what is being measured, incrementing the duration accordingly, until a successful POST is sent.

## Compression

Data can be sent in the following encoding formats:

* `identity`
* `deflate`
* `gzip`

If data is sent compressed, make sure the `Content-Encoding` header specifies the type of encoding.

## Examples

Here are some examples for developing plugins.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example_json"
    title="Example JSON"
  >
    This is an example of the JSON that would be used to POST data to Plugins. The JSON data is a hash with two required keys at the top level:

    * `agent`: A hash describing the agent that is reporting metrics data to Plugins. A POST can contain information for only one agent. Host and version are required.
    * `components`: An array of components, each consisting of a hash of attributes for the individual component. Multiple components can be sent with a single. Each component has its own name, GUID, duration, and metrics.

    ```
    {
      "agent": {
        "host" : "db.internal.your_company.com",
        "pid" : 1234,
        "version" : "1.0.0"
      },
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "Primary MySQL Database",
          "guid": "com.your_company_name.plugin_name",
          "duration" : 60,
          "metrics" : {
            "Component/ProductionDatabase[Queries/Second]": 100,
            "Component/AnalyticsDatabase[Queries/Second]": {
              "min" : 2,
              "max" : 10,
              "total": 12,
              "count" : 2,
              "sum_of_squares" : 104
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example_code"
    title="Pseudo-code template"
  >
    This is a pseudo-code example that works with the Plugin API. It can be used as a template for developing plugin agents.

    **Initialization:**

    ```
    // globals

    string platform_api_uri = "https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics"
    int poll_cycle = 60 // time in seconds
    string version = "1.0.0" // major_version.minor_version.patch_level
    string agent_host = get_host_name_where_this_process_is_running()
    string agent_pid = get_process_id_of_this_process()
    time last_poll_time // initialize if necessary

    initialize once
      create agent_hash with:
        agent_host
        agent_pid
        version
      for each newrelic_account do // just handling one account? then "for each" is unnecessary complexity
        for each monitored_component do
          create component_hash with:
            string guid = "com.your_company.component_name_in_snake_case"
            string name ="Human Readable Component Name"
            int duration = 0 // this will get updated each poll_cycle
            hash metrics_hash // this will be updated by populate_component_metrics_hash()
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    **Loop:**

    ```
    every poll_cycle seconds do
      for each newrelic_account do // just handling one account? then "for each" is unnecessary complexity
        clear hash_to_send
        add agent_hash to hash_to_send
        for each component do
          populate_component_metrics_hash()
          this component.metrics_hash("duration") = time.now() - last_poll_time in seconds
          add component.metrics_hash to hash_to_send
        end
        json_to_send = serialize_to_json(hash_to_send)
        connection = open http_connection(platform_api_uri)
        add header("X-License-Key",this newrelic_account.license_key) to connection
        add header("Content-Type","application/json") to connection
        add header("Accept","application/json") to connection
        set http_verb to "POST" for connection
        response = send(json_to_send) to connection
        case response.code
          when response_code = 200
            clear component.metrics_hash
            last_poll_time = time.now()
          when response_code = 400
            // your request was malformed
            // consider reporting a "supportability" metric which counts the number of 400 responses you get
            // for example "Component/Supportability/http_error_codes/400"
            // you can use this on a "Supportability" Dashboard that helps diagnose your agent
          when response_code = 403
            // forbidden probably due to a bad license key
            // log error and shutdown the agent
          when response_code = 404
            // invalid URL
            // you should never get this error for https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics
          when response_code = 405
            // invalid method
            // HTTP verb should be "POST"
          when response_code = 413
            // POST body too large
            // try splitting at component boundaries
            // split along metric name spaces
            // fail gracefully - consider reporting a supportability metric (see 400)
          when response_code = 500
            // error on New Relic's collector
            // could be due to malformed data or system trouble
            // fail gracefully - consider reporting a supportability metric (see 400)
          when response_code = 503 or 504
            // New Relic collector busy 
            //- this happens by design from time-to-time
            // keep collecting metrics
            // do NOT reset last_poll_time
            // log error if the problem persists for several minutes
        end case
      end
    end
    ```

    **Metric population:**

    ```
    function populate_component_metrics_hash()
      // collect metrics from monitored component at any interval
      // if this is the first time collecting metrics, set last_poll_time to
      // time.now - metric duration, the time duration for which these metrics
      // were collected
      //
      // if you collect 2 or more metrics from the monitored component before data
      // is reported to Plugins either because your metric collection interval is
      // faster than poll_cycle or because your agent was unable to report metrics to
      // Plugins (for example a 503 http response), aggregate your data by storing:
      // total_value, max, min, count, sum_of_squares for each metric
      //
      // if the interval is longer than poll_cycle, retain the metrics and
      // report them each poll_cycle until they are updated
    end
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## API responses and error codes [#errors]

Depending on whether you are using the Plugin API or an agent SDK for plugins, the HTTP responses and logging techniques may be different. For example, responses for the Plugin API are uncompressed JSON. Successful posts return this JSON:

```
{"status":"ok"}
```

The API does not support `Accept-Encoding`.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="logger"
    title="Debugging logs"
  >
    To debug information, use either of these options:

    ```
    public static Logger getLogger();
    ```

    OR

    ```
    public static void Logger setLogger(Logger logger) {
      LOGGER = logger;
      }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="errors"
    title="Error codes"
  >
    If an error occurs, an appropriate status code is returned. The JSON returned is the hash key `error` with a detailed description of the error that occurred. For example:

    ```
    {"error":"Failed to create agent with parameters=[...]"}
         {"error":"Missing metric data"}
         {"error":"Unable to parse body: Unexpected token RIGHT BRACE(}) at position 228."}
    ```
