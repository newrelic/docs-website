As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations):** Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com/):** Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center).
