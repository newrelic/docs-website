<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If you’d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

## View plugin dashboard details [#view]

Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers).

After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your **Plugins** menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central.

The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards.

To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Plugins**, and select your plugin.
2. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events.
3. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="plugin_summary"
    title="Plugin summary"
  >
    Depending on the plugin, the summary includes:

    * One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair)
    * Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts
    * Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts
    * Other information about alert violations, events, and activity

    If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features.

    <Table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width={250}>
            **If you want to...**
          </th>

          <th>
            **Do this...**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            View version information for a component's or instance's agent
          </td>

          <td>
            Mouse over the component's name.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Change the sort order
          </td>

          <td>
            On the title row of the plugin's summary page, select the up or down arrow for a component (instance) or a summary metric's label.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Show or hide items on the events and activity list
          </td>

          <td>
            Select an event icon, or select **All**.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            View details about an event
          </td>

          <td>
            On the events and activity list, select the link.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            View page details for a component or instance
          </td>

          <td>
            Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance).
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </Table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="plugin_dashboard"
    title="Plugin dashboards"
  >
    Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard [dashboard features](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-new-relic-ui-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information.

    The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update.

  <Collapser
    id="alert_details"
    title="Plugin alerts"
  >
    If the plugin publisher set **Critical** (red) or **Caution** (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can:

    * Select and view alert details.
    * Change the existing thresholds.
    * Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for **Critical** events.

## Delete a plugin [#delete]

Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's **Download** or **Continue** button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="removing_components"
    title="Remove plugin components (instances)"
  >
    At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray.

    Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides.

    Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
    icon for each component (instance).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="deleting_plugin"
    title="Delete the plugin"
  >
    After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your **Plugins** menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin.

    If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/).
