<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.
</Callout>

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of [December 2, 2020](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832), plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-plugin-eol-wednesday-june-16th-2021/127267).

## Developers and SaaS providers [#platform]

Plugin Central is where partners, third-party vendors, and users could publish plugin agents that collect selected data. This is also where you could install and view the plugin data on your Plugins dashboards as a set of summary metrics, charts, and tables.

In most cases, the plugin's agent runs on the users' app server. SaaS or PaaS providers can also create plugin agents that run on their system and report metrics for customers who use New Relic to monitor their applications. For more information, see the specific plugin agent SDK documentation.

## Plugin Central directory [#plugin_central]

<Callout variant="important">
  Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers).
</Callout>

The plugin agent collects, sends, and stores the metric data. Plugin Central provides a searchable directory for plugins that developers publish and make publicly available to users.

From Plugin Central, you can select and download whatever plugins you want to use. After you install or configure a plugin, you can view the plugin's dashboard data securely from the plugins user interface in New Relic One.

## View plugins in Plugin Central [#plugin_central]

To view information about available (published) plugins: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Plugins**. By default, available plugins appear in alphabetical order.

![Plugins in New Relic One: Plugin Central](./images/plugins-landing-page-prototype071720.png "Plugins in New Relic One: Plugin Central")

From the Plugin Central directory in New Relic One, select any published plugin to view a description and install it.

Depending on the selected plugin, installation and configuration instructions will vary. Refer to your plugin's documentation for specific details. After you install or configure a plugin, it automatically appears on your Plugins menu in New Relic One, where you can select and view it directly. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to appear.

## Get started with plugins [#terminology]

Here are some tips for making the most of Plugin Central.

    Plugins listed in New Relic's Plugin Central include a 5-star rating system, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). This helps you make more informed choices when choosing among similar plugins. This also provides a way for you to share what you think of a plugin.

    You can rate as many plugins as you want. If you have not voted for a plugin, its current star rating (gold or gray) does not include an outline.

    You can have only one vote for a specific plugin, and you cannot delete your vote. However, you can change your rating level anytime. After you select the star level (1 to 5) to cast your vote, the stars change to gold with an outline at the rating level you selected.

    Plugin Central includes a simple review system to share what you think of a plugin and to provide tips for others about installation and usage. Existing reviews appear when you select an individual plugin's title or **Get started** link.

    You can write as many reviews for as many plugins as you want, following the [feedback policy](#feedback-policy). You can also edit or delete your own reviews. When you write a review for a plugin, if you have not already rated the plugin, you must provide a rating. Subsequent reviews will use the rating you provided. You can change your rating at any time.

    Plugin administrators also reserve the right to delete reviews if necessary. For more information, see [Plugin feedback policy](#feedback-policy).

    Here are some types of reviews we welcome:

    * Your experience using the plugin
    * Suggestions for improvement
    * Your thoughts or opinions about the plugin, even if you disagree with us or point out mistakes
    * Constructive criticism

    Your review must not contain personal attacks, name calling, libel, defamation, hate speech, etc. And under no circumstances should you post anything that could be taken as threatening, harassing, bullying, obscene, pornographic, sexist, or racist.

    We reserve the right to moderate reviews to make sure the tone is civil and fair. We will delete a review or rating in these situations:

    * **Spam**, such as off-topic or nonsense reviews
    * **Inappropriate reviews** including profanity and links to offensive content
    * **Attacks**, including personal attacks against the plugin author or other reviewers, as well as attacks against New Relic or other companies. This does not mean you can't disagree with us or with each other, just be polite about it.
    * **False reviews** that contain misleading statements or claims
    * **Other**; for example, reviews or ratings that appear to be gaming the system
