<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of [December 2, 2020](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832), plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-plugin-eol-wednesday-june-16th-2021/127267).

## Plugin help resources [#publisher]

Each plugin in New Relic's Plugin Central typically includes troubleshooting information. When you select the plugin's **Download** or **Continue** button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation.

If you experience problems that the plugin's documentation does not address, contact the plugin publisher's support resources identified in the plugin's **Get support** link. Be prepared to provide information such as:

* Are you able to connect to the plugins UI or able to connect to the monitored server?
* Do you have a New Relic license key or a message about an invalid license key?
* If you received a specific error, what was its error number or message?
* Can you provide a screenshot of the plugin's webpage where you are experiencing problems?
* Can you provide a log file?
* Can you provide your configuration file?
* Can you restart the plugin?

Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers).
