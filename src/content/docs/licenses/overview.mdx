    **Welcome to New Relic!** We want to ensure that you can successfully use our products and services. And we want to protect both your rights as a customer and our legal requirements.

    When you sign up for your New Relic account, you agree to our standard [Terms and Conditions](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms). If you have entered into a separate paid agreement with us for specific services, then the terms of that agreement control.

    Here is a reference library of our licenses and other legal documentation. If you have additional questions, please contact your New Relic account representative.
