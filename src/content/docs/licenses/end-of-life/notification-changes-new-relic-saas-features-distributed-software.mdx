At New Relic, we support our customers by continually improving our Software as a Service (SaaS) features and distributed software. Sometimes that means we introduce changes that can include moving away from existing software components and features, called end-of-life (EOL).

As we make these decisions, we strive to balance the need to introduce improvements with our customer's tolerance for change. We do our best to anticipate the impact of these changes for our customers.

## What we communicate [#what]

We're committed to communicating about the changes that impact user experience, especially when these changes have a significant effect on workflow. In assessing impact we evaluate:

* Potential impact to customer workflow
* Feature usage information
* Customer feedback

In communicating changes, we strive to:

* Give as much lead time as possible
* Minimize interruption
* Provide a documented alternative

## Lead time for notifications [#lead-time]

EOL changes are classified into the following categories:

## EOL lead times: impact on distributed software [#impact]

### Subject to EOL lead times [#eol-products]

Our lead time notifications also apply to distributed software, which is software developed by New Relic that is installed on customer-owned systems. Distributed software is not cloud-based, and has a lifespan from the date of each released version. After that date, it may cease to function or stop reporting data to New Relic.

In the event a released version of software will cease normal function sooner than the applicable compatibility lifespan set forth below, New Relic will follow the [EOL notification process](#lead-time).

For proprietary (not open-sourced) New Relic distributed software or software designated as [Community Plus open source projects](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings/#open-source-projects), the following lifespans apply:

* Released on or after August 1, 2022: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least one year after the date of publishing the release.
* Released on or after October 1, 2020, and until July 31, 2022: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least two years after the date of publishing the release.
* Released prior to October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible for at least three years after the date of publishing the release.

All fixes and security updates are provided in the latest released version of distributed software, and we encourage our customers to keep installed software up to date.

### EOL lead times not applicable [#open-source]

New Relic participates in many community-led software development projects and has fully open sourced many of our distributed software projects as community projects. Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at github.com/newrelic, including:Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at [github.com/newrelic](https://github.com/newrelic), including:

* Community projects
* nr1-catalog
* Example code
* New Relic experimental
* Archived

Our EOL policy does not apply to these projects, which is why we do not provide advance EOL notification for them. However, you can still find information and support for selected projects through:

* New Relic's documentation at [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com)
* Project repos at [github.com/newrelic](https://github.com/newrelic)
