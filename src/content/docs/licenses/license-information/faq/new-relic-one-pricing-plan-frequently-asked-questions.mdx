    **A:** Unless otherwise stated in an Order, Customers that previously purchased extended retention for their products under the product-based pricing plan (i.e., New Relic Insights Pro and/or New Relic Logs) have access to that same level of extended retention under New Relic One-based pricing for its initial New Relic One term at no additional cost.
