These are some frequently asked questions about [New Relic's usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing) (formerly referred to in this documentation as the New Relic One pricing model) that arise for agreement-level language. **This is meant to serve as a supplement to the main [New Relic usage-based pricing docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing).**

<Callout variant="important">
  Beginning May 17, 2022, we will no longer refer to our New Relic observability platform as "New Relic One" and have updated our documentation to reflect this change. 

  This is only a name change; New Relic continues to offer the same value you're used to receiving from the observability platform.
