**Updated 26 October 2022.**

The below Security Policy applies only to customers with an existing New Relic agreement in place that explicitly references this Security Policy applying to the Service purchased in an Order. Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in such New Relic agreement.

## New Relic Security Policy [#security-policy]

## 1. Purpose

This Policy describes New Relic's security program and the technical and organizational security controls to protect New Relic's systems as shown in New Relic's third-party audits and certifications. New Relic may update this Policy from time to time, and such updates will not materially reduce the overall protections set forth in this Policy. The then-current terms of this Policy are available at [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-policy/](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-policy/).

## 2. Security Overview

**2.1.** New Relic maintains a comprehensive Information Protection Program to manage information security within New Relic that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data and that is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of New Relic's business operations. New Relic's Information Protection Program includes:

**2.1.1.** executive review, support and accountability for all security related policies and practices;

**2.1.2.** formal written policies and procedures that are designed to protect against the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access or alteration of Customer Data, meet or exceed applicable industry standards, outlines a definition of information security and its overall objectives, include defined information security roles and responsibilities, a framework for setting control objectives and controls, a formal and effective risk mitigation program and a service provider security management program;

**2.1.3.** periodic risk assessments, including internal audits and/or independent 3rd party audits, to measure the effectiveness and appropriateness of controls for all systems processing Customer Data;

**2.1.4.** in-depth review of security incidents, including effective determination of root cause and corrective action;
formal, industry-recognized controls frameworks based on an external audit standard;

**2.1.5.** employee screening and access management; and

**2.1.6.** comprehensive security testing, vulnerability identification, and mitigation methodology that consists of a variety of independent approaches that, when combined, are designed to maximize coverage for a diverse set of attack vectors.

**2.2.** New Relic's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads New Relic's Information Security Program and develops, reviews, and approves, with appropriate stakeholders, New Relic's security policies and procedures. New Relic has appointed data protection officer(s) as described in New Relic's Privacy Notices who are consulted as necessary under applicable laws.

**2.3.** Information security objectives, approach, scope, importance, goals, and principles for the organization's security program are formally identified, communicated throughout the organization to users in a form that is relevant, accessible, and understandable to the intended reader; and supported by a controls framework that considers legislative, regulatory, contractual requirements, and other policy-related requirements.

**2.4.** New Relic will maintain written policies and procedures to review, test, and approve (as appropriate) changes affecting New Relic infrastructure and systems that process Customer Data including, but not limited to, peer reviews prior to introducing new code into production. New Relic will establish acceptance criteria for new information systems, upgrades, and new versions and will carry out suitable tests of the system(s) during development and prior to acceptance. Any changes or updates will not materially decrease the security of the systems.

## 3.Security Certifications

**3.1.** New Relic regularly tests, assesses, and evaluates its security measures for protecting Customer Data using industry-recognized standards and uses independent third-party auditors to verify such controls.

**3.2.** New Relic agrees to provide Customer, upon request, with applicable certifications or reports about New Relic systems. All information exchanged in connection with the audit activities described in this section is deemed to be the Confidential Information of New Relic.

**3.3.** Additional information about New Relic's security certifications are available on New Relic's [Security Guide](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-guide).

## 4. Data Control and Encryption

**4.1.** The Service and related features are designed to provide Customer with control over Customer's data sources and Customer's environments that are monitored and sending data to New Relic.

**4.2.** New Relic will have established methods to: (i) enable Customer to use encryption on Customer Data in transit from Customer's environment to New Relic, and (ii) securely hash passwords in storage following industry standard practices (e.g. scrypt) as described in the Documentation. Server certificate-based authentication is used as part of the TLS encryption with a trusted certificate authority.

**4.3.** New Relic receives and processes data in accordance with the Agreement and the Services as described in the Documentation. New Relic permits customers to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws as further described in the Documentation. In the event of error in personal data sent in Customer Data Customers may request personal data deletion and re-send data that is accurate.

**4.4.** Additional information for Customer data control and encryption, including encryption of data at rest, is available on New Relic's [Security Guide](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-guide).

## 5. Facilities

**5.1.** All physical locations that process Customer Data are co-locations and third party data centers. All physical locations have security measures in place that are designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to data processing facilities and unlawful access, modification, or destruction of Customer Data.

**5.2.** New Relic will seek assurances (e.g., in the form of an independent 3rd party audit report such as the SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, and vendor security evaluations) from its data processing facilities vendors that store or process Customer Data:

**5.2.1.** secure its data process facilities in an access-controlled location and have protections in place to prevent unauthorized access, damage, and interference;

**5.2.2** employ physical security appropriate to the classification of the assets and information being managed which may include card key access, security cameras, and solid wall construction for all exterior walls;
