Without overriding any express provisions that you may have agreed to in a separate written preview or pre-release agreement executed by you and New Relic, the following terms apply to your use of any New Relic Pre-Release Service(s).

## New Relic Pre-Release Policy [#pre-release-policy]

Through your use of any New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”) Pre-Release Services (as further defined), you signify that you have read, understood, and accept the terms of this Pre-Release Policy (the “Policy”) governing your use and participation in New Relic’s program for making beta, alpha, and pre-release versions of New Relic software (i.e. agents, SDKs, APIs, integrations, private locations, code, etc.), services, features, user-interfaces, and platforms made available for evaluation purposes (the “Pre-Release Service(s)”). Pre-Release Service(s) may also be designated as a pilot, limited release, preview, developer preview, technology preview, limited preview, public preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description. This Policy is effective on behalf of yourself or the entity(ies) associated with your New Relic account (collectively referred to herein as “you” or “your”) as of your date of first use of the Pre-Release Service(s) (the “Effective Date”), which means that your choice to use the Pre-Release Service(s) means that you have the legal authority to use the Pre-Release Service(s) personally or on behalf of the company or organization associated with your New Relic account in accordance with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully as your use of Pre-Release Service(s) may have unintended consequences and materially impact your data or use of the New Relic services and products. If you do not agree to this Policy, your sole remedy is to not make use of the Pre-Release Services.

## 1. Introduction [#introduction]

This Policy and any New Relic technical guides and documentation made available with the Pre-Release Service(s) or from the dedicated ‘Documentation’ page of the New Relic website (the “Documentation”) enables you to test experimental features and products before they are made generally available. New Relic reserves the right to withhold or discontinue any Pre-Release Service(s) in its sole discretion and provides no guarantee that any Pre-Release Service(s) will eventually be made commercially or generally available.

Pre-Release Service(s) are versions provided before they are generally available and may have bugs, stability issues, or other problems. Use of the Pre-Release Service(s) may result in unexpected results, loss of data, outages, or other damage to your systems or networks. New Relic advises against using the Pre-Release Service(s) in production. No support is offered with or for Pre-Release Service(s). You hereby release New Relic from any liability arising from or related to your use of the Pre-Release Service(s).

In connection with your use of the Pre-Release Services, you may provide feedback, comments, and/or suggestions based on or relating to the Pre-Release Services (“Feedback”). The Pre-Release Services and any related information, including without limitation features, functionality, designs, user interface, capabilities, specifications, architectural diagrams, usage data, APIs, deployment schedules, email lists, bug databases, know how, source code, potential features, Feedback, and information related to any business or technical information of New Relic, including without limitation product plans, costs, prices, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, research, development, and negotiations are considered confidential information of New Relic (“Confidential Information”).
