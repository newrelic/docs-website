## Security Program

New Relic follows "privacy by design" principles as described here: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/).

## Security Domains

New Relic’s policies and procedures cover industry-recognized security domains such as Endpoint Protection; Portable Media Security; Mobile Device Security; Wireless Security; Configuration Management; Vulnerability Management; Network Protection; Transmission Protection; Password Management; Access Control, Audit Logging & Monitoring; Education, Training, and Awareness; Third Party Assurance; Incident Management; Business Continuity and Disaster Recover; Risk Management; Data Protection & Privacy; and Service Management Systems.

## Security Certifications

New Relic audits its Services against industry standards as described at [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/).

## Data Control, Facilities, and Encryption

* New Relic's customers can send data to New Relic's APIs by (1) using New Relic's software, (2) using vendor-neutral software that is managed and maintained by a third-party such as via [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/#benefits) provided by [opentelemetry.io](opentelemetry.io), or (3) from third-party systems that customer's manage and/or control.
* New Relic's customers can use New Relic's Services such as NerdGraph to filter out and drop data. See [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/).
* New Relic's customers can adjust their data retention periods as appropriate for their needs. See [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention).
* New Relic's log management capabilities obfuscate numbers that match known patterns, such as bank card and social security numbers as described in our [log management security documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy/).
* New Relic honors requests to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Please see [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/).
* Customers may use New Relic's APIs to query data, such as NerdGraph described here, and New Relic Services to export the data to other cloud providers.
* Customers can configure its log forwarder [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/] before sending infrastructure logs to New Relic.
* For New Relic Customers in New Relic US, FedRAMP and HIPAA-enabled environments, Customer Data is replicated to the off-site backup system via Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
