## Subscriptions with indeterminate pricing or usage quantities [#indeterminate-pricing]

### Product Usage Ratio

Where a Customer subscription to the Products contain no specific pricing or quantities, Product-specific usage for a specific calendar month shall be determined through the calculation of the following ratio (the “Product Usage Ratio”) where: (1) the numerator shall be the Product specific usage for such calendar month multiplied by such Product’s list price, and (2) the denominator shall be the the aggregate Customer usage of all Products during such calendar month multiplied by all such Product(s) list price. The Product Usage Ratio shall be the percentage of usage for a specific Product for a calendar month period, or if usage cannot be measured for a period, the last Product Usage Ratio that can be calculated shall be assumed constant.
