Notes:


<sup>1</sup>  For eligible customers with full platform users, you are subject to limited-time promotional pricing for the first twelve tiers: $0.5503 per 1 CCU per month.

If you are using the Enterprise edition, the EU data region, or other options available for CCU, the applicable List Price is calculated by multiplying the value in above table's List Price column by these factors:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Option
          </th>

          <th>
            Multiply list prices by
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Pro (EU)
          </td>

          <td>
            1.1500
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Enterprise
          </td>

          <td>
            1.3300
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Enterprise (EU)
          </td>

          <td>
            1.5295
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    On a monthly basis, CCU usage will be charged for each CCU within each tier beginning at the initial tier at its corresponding price. Only those units exceeding the preceding tier(s) are entitled to the reduced List Price in the subsequent tier(s). Calculated charges are based on factors that have four decimal places. Amounts invoiced are rounded up to the nearest cent where applicable.
