This Usage Plan provides details relevant to New Relic's [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) for customers on a Buying Program identified below.

<Callout variant="important">
  Beginning February 1, 2023, we refer to subscriptions, such as "Savings Plan" and "Volume Plan" in this Usage Plan, as "Buying Programs" instead. Updates to Orders to reference "Buying Program" instead of "Subscriptions" will be made on a rolling basis. If your Order references a "Subscription," then it means the relevant "Buying Programs" further described below.
</Callout>

This Usage plan applies to New Relic's usage-based pricing model and Buying Programs described herein. New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer or changes to the list prices section; all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. New Relic may provide additional rights to your Buying Program, which are effective upon delivery of the written notice, provided such new rights are to the benefit of the Customer and such notice has been delivered through the Account or via the email address [customer.notices@newrelic.com](mailto:customer.notices@newrelic.com).

Undefined terms used in this Usage Plan or Order shall have the meaning set forth herein or in [New Relic usage-based pricing definitions](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions).

    * Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a consumption basis. A PAYG Order has a rolling one-day term ("Commitment Term").
    * Customer's usage of the Products in excess of the [Free Edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer's Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order or this Usage Plan and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”).
    * Customer may request termination of its PAYG Buying Programs at any time with written notice to New Relic at [billing@newrelic.com](mailto:billing@newrelic.com) with fees being payable up until the effective date of such termination.

    * The Annual Pool of Funds Buying Program is no longer generally available. These terms apply solely to customers already on the APOF Buying Program through the end of the Commitment Term.
    * The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the 'Billing Terms' described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer's Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed ("Monthly Product Usage"). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference ("Additional Usage"), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed by the Order.
    * A final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Additional Usage/Monthly Add-on Invoice may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date.
    * Any unconsumed balances from the payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term.
    * After auto-renewal you're subject to our primary method of counting and billing for users described [here](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/).

  <Collapser
    id="volume-plan"
    title="Volume Plan"

    * The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the Billing Terms described in your Order. If additional Products are used and/or monthly usage of the Product(s) exceeds the Licensed Monthly Quantities, the difference will be invoiced monthly at the corresponding rates ("Monthly Add-on Invoice"). Products and pricing not defined in the Order are defined in the Usage Plan.
    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, the Commitment Fee for the New Relic Volume Plan Buying Program will automatically renew for a subsequent Commitment Term at the same rates unless New Relic notifies you with at least 30 days prior notice of such increase to then-current List Prices.
    * The Monthly Fee and any Monthly Discounted Rates or Committed Pricing for the Products are blended fees based on volume discounting in consideration of the Licensed Monthly Quantities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the Commitment Fee decreases, as captured in a separate Order, New Relic may increase the Monthly Fee and/or any Monthly Discounted Rates or Committed Pricing for the Products.

  <Collapser
    id="savings-plans"
    title="Savings Plan"
  >
    * The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the 'Billing Terms' described in your Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term and through the end of the month in which the Commitment Fee is consumed in full, Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding rates and summed ("Monthly Product Usage").

    * Starting on the first day of the calendar month following the earlier of either (a) full depletion of the Commitment Fee, or (b) end of the Rollover Period, your Buying Program will convert from the Savings Plan to New Relic Pay As You Go ("PAYG") and your Products will convert as described in the PAYG Conversion Table below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Commitment Fee or Rollover Balance expires upon the Renewal Date; or (ii) the Commitment Fee is consumed in full in the calendar month of the Renewal Date, as of the Renewal Date your Monthly Product Usage will be billable under the PAYG Buying Program or in accordance with an immediately succeeding Order starting on the Renewal Date. Fees related to usage on PAYG will be paid monthly in arrears and calculated by multiplying the Per Unit usage of the Products by the PAYG List Price. PAYG conversions shall be at the higher of PAYG List Price or current rates/price defined in your Order based on Products provisioned pursuant to your Order. Products and pricing not defined in the Order are defined in the Usage Plan.

    * Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference on a monthly basis.

    * If Customer's Buying Program is converted from Savings Plan to New Relic Pay As You Go as described in the Order, then Customer may request termination of its PAYG Buying Program at any time with written notice to New Relic at [billing@newrelic.com](mailto:billing@newrelic.com) with fees being payable up until the effective date of such termination.

    * A final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced upon expiration of the Commitment Term of the Order. For clarity, your Commitment Term ends on the Renewal Date stated in your Order Form, or sooner upon full depletion of the Commitment Fee.

    * If, in an immediately succeeding order starting on the Renewal Date, you purchase a new annual commitment fee equal to or greater than eighty percent (80%) of the average annual Commitment Fee, any unconsumed, aggregate balance from the payment of the Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, will remain available ("Rollover Balance") to consume at your then-current rates for up to a 12-month period starting on the Renewal Date ("Rollover Period"). If you do not meet the foregoing requirement for a Rollover Balance, any unconsumed balances from amounts payable, including the Commitment Fee as set out in an Order, will expire and lapse at the end of the Commitment Term.

    * Rollover Balance will be consumed first for usage-based charges for your then-current Buying Program at the rates set in your then-current Order, as of the Renewal Date.

    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, the Commitment Fee and, if applicable, Credits for the New Relic Savings Plan Buying Program will not automatically renew for a subsequent Commitment Term. Once the Buying Program converts to PAYG, usage of the Products will continue as described herein.

    Notes:

    <sup>1</sup> Your Order and/or invoice will include both the Product name and applicable edition for your Buying Program.

    <sup>2</sup> List Prices are promotional and subject to change. All amounts are monthly and in USD.

    <sup>3</sup> You may only utilize one of the following user editions at any given time: New Relic - Standard Full Platform Users, New Relic - Pro Full Platform Users, or New Relic - Enterprise Full Platform Users. You may only utilize one data option at any given time: New Relic - Data, or New Relic - Data Plus.

    <sup>4</sup> $10 promotional price for the first user; $99 per additional user, up to a maximum of five (5) total users.

    <sup>5</sup> Rounded up to nearest cent where applicable.

    <sup>6</sup>  For eligible customers with full platform users, you are subject to limited-time promotional pricing for the first twelve tiers: $0.5503 per 1 CCU per month.

    If you are using the Enterprise edition, the EU data region, or other options available for CCU, the applicable List Price is calculated by multiplying the value in above table's List Price column by these factors:

    On a monthly basis, CCU usage will be charged for each CCU within each tier beginning at the initial tier at its corresponding price. Only those units exceeding the preceding tier(s) are entitled to the reduced List Price in the subsequent tier(s). Calculated charges are based on factors that have four decimal places. Amounts invoiced are rounded up to the nearest cent where applicable.

    With an active Order for the Pro or Enterprise editions of the New Relic platform, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ['Service level availability commitment' page](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/service-level-availability-commitment) in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your Order with the New Relic Pro or Enterprise editions.

    If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with [New Relic usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Standard edition available in line with industry standards.

    New Relic may release additional features, modules, or pre-release, preview, and beta products available to Customer subject to Service Specific Terms. "Service Specific Terms" means the terms that apply to additional Services currently found at [newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms). Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie, is subject to their respective terms of service.

    If you enable a separate platform with New Relic's platform, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf.  For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of New Relic's platform and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic observability platform warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms.

    Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.

  >
    On May 17, 2022, we stopped referring to our New Relic observability platform as "New Relic One" and have updated our documentation to reflect this change. Additionally, our license documentation will no longer refer to our usage-based pricing model as the "New Relic One" pricing model. This is only a name change; New Relic continues to offer the same value you're used to receiving from the observability platform. As examples, references to "New Relic One" in our documentation, including this Usage Plan, should now be read as "New Relic" or "New Relic observability platform," and references to "New Relic One - Data" on Orders in are now "New Relic - Data."
