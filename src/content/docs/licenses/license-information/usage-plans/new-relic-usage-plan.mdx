This Usage Plan provides details relevant to New Relic's [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) for customers on a Buying Program identified below.  

<Callout variant="important">
Beginning February 1, 2023, we'll begin referring to subscriptions, such as "Savings Plan" and "Volume Plan" in this Usage Plan, as "Buying Programs" instead. Updates to Orders to reference "Buying Program" instead of "Subscriptions" will be made on a rolling basis. If your Order references a "Subscription," then it means the relevant "Buying Programs" further described below.

On May 17, 2022, we stopped referring to our New Relic observability platform as "New Relic One" and have updated our documentation to reflect this change. Additionally, our license documentation will no longer refer to our usage-based pricing model as the "New Relic One" pricing model. This is only a name change; New Relic continues to offer the same value you're used to receiving from the observability platform. As examples, references to "New Relic One" in our documentation, including this Usage Plan, should now be read as "New Relic" or "New Relic observability platform," and references to "New Relic One - Data" on Orders in are now "New Relic - Data."
</Callout>

This Usage plan applies to New Relic's usage-based pricing model and Buying Programs described herein. New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer or changes to the list prices section; all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. New Relic may provide additional rights to your Buying Program, which are effective upon delivery of the written notice, provided such new rights are to the benefit of the Customer and such notice has been delivered through the Account or via the email address customer.notices@newrelic.com.

Undefined terms used in this Usage Plan or Order shall have the meaning set forth herein or in [New Relic usage-based pricing definitions](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions).

    * Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis.
    * Customer's usage of the Products in excess of the [Free Tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer's Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order or this Usage Plan and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”).
    * Customer may request termination of its PAYG Buying Programs at any time with written notice to New Relic at billing@newrelic.com with fees being payable up until the effective date of such termination.

  >
    * The Annual Pool of Funds Buying Program is no longer generally available. These terms apply solely to customers already on the APOF Buying Program through the end of the Commitment Term.
    * The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the 'Billing Terms' described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer's Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed by the Order.
    * A final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Additional Usage/Monthly Add-on Invoice may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date.
    * Any unconsumed balances from the payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term.
    * After auto-renewal you're subject to our primary method of counting and billing for users described [here](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/).

  <Collapser
    id="volume-plan"
    title="Volume Plan"

* The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the Billing Terms described in your Order. If additional Products are used and/or monthly usage of the Product(s) exceeds the Licensed Monthly Quantities, the difference will be invoiced monthly at the corresponding rates ("Monthly Add-on Invoice"). Products and pricing not defined in the Order are defined in the Usage Plan.
* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, the Commitment Fee for the New Relic Volume Plan Buying Program will automatically renew for a subsequent Commitment Term at the same rates unless New Relic notifies you with at least 30 days prior notice of such increase to then-current List Prices.
* The Monthly Fee and any Monthly Discounted Rates for the Products are blended fees based on volume discounting in consideration of the Licensed Monthly Quantities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the Commitment Fee decreases, as captured in a separate Order, New Relic may increase the Monthly Fee and/or any Monthly Discounted rates for the Products.

    * The Commitment Fee will be invoiced as per the 'Billing Terms' described in your Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term and through the end of the month in which the Commitment Fee is consumed in full, Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding rates and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). 
    * Starting on the first day of the calendar month following the earlier of either (a) full depletion of the Commitment Fee, or (b) end of the Rollover Period, your Buying Program will convert from the Savings Plan to New Relic Pay As You Go (“PAYG”) and your Products will convert as described in the PAYG Conversion Table below. Fees related to usage on PAYG will be paid monthly in arrears and calculated by multiplying the Per Unit usage of the Products by the PAYG List Price. PAYG conversions shall be at the higher of PAYG List Price or current rates/price defined in your Order based on Products provisioned pursuant to your Order. Products and pricing not defined in the Order is defined in the Usage Plan.

    * Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference on a monthly basis.
    * If Customer's Buying Program is converted from Savings Plan to New Relic Pay As You Go as described in the Order, then Customer may request termination of its PAYG Buying Program at any time with written notice to New Relic at billing@newrelic.com with fees being payable up until the effective date of such termination.  
    * A final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced upon expiration of the Commitment Term of the Order. Any unconsumed, aggregate balance from the payment of the Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, will remain available (“Rollover Balance”) to consume at your then-current rates for up to a 12-month period following the Renewal Date (“Rollover Period”). 
    * Rollover Balance will be consumed first for usage-based charges for your then-current Buying Program at the rates set in your then-current Order, after the Renewal Date. 
    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, the Commitment Fee for the New Relic Savings Plan Buying Program will not automatically renew for a subsequent Commitment Term. Once the Buying Program converts to PAYG, usage of the Products will continue as described herein.

    With an active Order for the Pro or Enterprise editions of the New Relic platform, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ['Service level availability commitment' page](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/service-level-availability-commitment) in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your Order with the New Relic Pro or Enterprise editions.

    If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with [New Relic usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Standard edition available in line with industry standards.
