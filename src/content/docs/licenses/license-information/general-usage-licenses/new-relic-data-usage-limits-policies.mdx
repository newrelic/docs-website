This document lists some important account-level limits and links to other limit-related docs.

## Overview of limits [#overview-limits]

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers.

If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its child accounts might experience one or both of the following:

* Sampling of data
* Temporary pause or cessation of data collection

To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see [View limits](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/view-system-limits). If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs.

## View limits and manage data [#violations]

Want to understand your accountâ€™s limit violations using the UI? See [View limits](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/view-system-limits).

Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See [Manage data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data).

## Account-level limits [#all_products]

The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like [agents and integrations](#other-limits), have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits.

\* NRDB records refers to database records for our [core data types](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types), which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the [New Relic database](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data) (NRDB). This does **not** include [metric timeslice data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data).

### Data ingest APIs

Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general [account-level limits](#all_products). Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks#telemetry-sdk) or our [open source telemetry integrations](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations)).

* [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes) (dimensional metrics)
* [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api)
* [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api)
* [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-general-requirements-limits)

## Other agent and integration limits [#other-limits]

To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general [account-level limits](#all_products), see the docs for those tools: you can [search our solutions here](https://newrelic.com/integrations). Some default reporting limits are located in these tools' configuration docs.
