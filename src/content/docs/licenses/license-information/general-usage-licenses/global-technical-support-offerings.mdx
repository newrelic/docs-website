## Scope of support [#scope-support]

### What's in scope? [#in-scope]

You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in [New Relic Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/). New Relic's Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. We provide assistance in English or Japanese only.

### What's out of scope? [#outside-scope]

    Generally Available products are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation, and we're here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. If you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, [New Relic's Expert Services](https://newrelic.com/expertservices) is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments.

New Relic's Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic [Developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/) provides guidance on building custom apps, and [here are a growing number of open source apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/) that you can use to get started.

    title="Troubleshooting third-party tools and services"

    New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We'll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic's Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The [Community](https://discuss.newrelic.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic) are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well.

## Open source support [#open-source-support]

<Callout variant="important">
  For more information on OpenTelemetry support, see our [OpenTelemetry support documentation](#otel_support).
</Callout>

We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards and open-sourcing all of our instrumentation. Below you will find our open source projects categories and where support can help.

## OpenTelemetry support [#otel_support]

If you experience unexpected issues when using [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) OpenTelemetry tools](https://opentelemetry.io/) with New Relic, you have multiple outlets to get help.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nr-otel"
    title="Get help from New Relic Global Technical Support"
  >
    **New Relic community support:**

    [New Relic Support Forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com/) is available to everyone and provides OpenTelemetry focused documentation, examples, and best practices to help you get up and running. Our public [troubleshooting frameworks](https://discuss.newrelic.com/search?expanded=true&q=%23proven-practices%3Aproven-practices-best-practices-guide%20tags%3Aopentelemetry) are a good resource if you run into issues. If you need a little more individualized help, you can engage with our support team through the New Relic Support Forum by [creating a topic](https://discuss.newrelic.com/latest), and a member of our team will respond to your inquiry.

    **Additional support channels:**

    Please see [Global Technical Support offerings](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings/) for more information on additional support channels that may be available with your New Relic subscription plan.

    Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for case support from New Relic Global Technical Support for OpenTelemetry:

    * You can receive troubleshooting assistance for the installation and configuration of OpenTelemetry when deployed according to our [reference architecture best practices](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-ref-architecture/).
    * You can receive troubleshooting assistance on the processing and exporting of your OpenTelemetry data to New Relic when transmitting it to us over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) protocol from your community provided OpenTelemetry Clients / SDKs or the OpenTelemetry Collector.
    * The scope of our support of the [OpenTelemetry community provided components](https://github.com/open-telemetry) is limited to the most recent release / current version of OpenTelemetry clients, SDKs, auto-instrumentation-agents, collector and instrumentation libraries.
    * Our ability to engage with you when you customize your deployment of OpenTelemetry may be limited.
    * OpenTelemetry is a collection of community-developed and maintained telemetry tools.  Because of this, our ability to resolve some issues, bugs, limitations, etc. that you may encounter may be outside of our control.
    * For issues with OpenTelemetry tools that are outside our control to resolve, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to contribute enhancements, patches, or other functional developments to the upstream OpenTelemetry community's open source project. **We are unable to provide timelines for bug fixes from the OpenTelemetry development community, and the community may choose not to accept any such contributions.**

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nr-otel-supp"
    title="Get help from the OpenTelemetry Community"
  >
    <Callout variant="important">
      Support outside of New Relic that may be available from the [CNCF OpenTelemetry Community](https://opentelemetry.io/community/) is not maintained by New Relic Global Technical Support and is not subject to conditions outlined in the New Relic Global Technical Support Offering.
    </Callout>

    [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open source project, so you can also engage and find help from other sources besides New Relic through the Open Source Community. For issues unrelated to the New Relic platform, you may be able to get help from the OpenTelemetry Community in the following ways:

    * For issues related to a specific client / SDK you can open an issue in the github repo associated with that product. For example, for issues with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, you would [open an issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java) to ask for help, to report a bug or to file a feature request.
    * You can also often find help through [CNCF's Slack instance](https://cloud-native.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FCJFCJHG4Q). Each client / SDK has a slack channel, but if you're not sure where your question is best directed, ask in `#opentelemetry`, and someone will help you route your request to those that may be able to help you. You can find members of New Relic's engineering teams in the `#otel-newrelic` channel, and they may be able to help you too.
