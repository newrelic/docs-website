You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in [New Relic Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/). New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance.

### Support includes

* Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform
* Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments
* Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments
* Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic
* General usage and best practice guidelines
* Identifying bugs with New Relic Products
* Assistance in English or Japanese Only ([Japanese customer Terms of Service](https://newrelic.co.jp/termsandconditions/enhanced-terms-of-service/))

    Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s [Expert Services](https://newrelic.com/expertservices) is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments.

    We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic).

    With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The [New Relic Developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps) provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of [open source apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects/?category=New%20Relic%20One%20Catalog) that you can use to get started.

    We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. [New Relic Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/) and [New Relic University](https://learn.newrelic.com/) offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries.

    New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes.

    Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions.

    title="Troubleshooting of customer environment"

    We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next.

  <Collapser

    title="Troubleshooting third-party tools & services"
  >
    New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The [Community](https://discuss.newrelic.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic) are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well.

    For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions.

    We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey.
