As a customer, you are eligible to participate in New Relic’s Developer Program subject to additional terms. Additional information and resources are available at [New Relic's Developer Program site](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-developer-edition/developer-program-resources).

By downloading, accessing, or using the developer resources (including the CLI), you agree that usage of the developer resources is pursuant to the [New Relic Developers Terms and Conditions](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/developers) and that you have the authority to bind your organization. Such terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, your sole remedy is to not use these developer resources. If your use of the New Relic developer resources are covered under a separate agreement, the above does not apply to you.
