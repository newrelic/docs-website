We love open-source software, and Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic’s integration with [Community Cloud for Pixie](https://pixielabs.ai/), a New Relic implementation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s magical Pixie open source software.  Thank you, open-source community, for making these fine tools! 

Open source software distributed through Community Cloud for Pixie, including [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie), is governed by the applicable third-party licenses provided with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Pixie projects, software, and code available at https://github.com/pixie-io.
