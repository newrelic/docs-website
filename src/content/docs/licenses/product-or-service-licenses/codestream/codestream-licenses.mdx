We love open-source software, and we use the following with CodeStream. Thank you, open-source community, for making these fine tools! Some of these are listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use.

* [CodeStream license on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/blob/develop/LICENSE)
* [CodeStream's third-party software notices on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/blob/develop/ThirdPartyNotices.txt)
