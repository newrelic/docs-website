If you believe someone is violating the [Code of Conduct](/docs/licenses/open-source/code-of-conduct), we ask that you report it to the New Relic open source steering committee by emailing opensource@newrelic.com. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this [Code of Conduct](/docs/licenses/open-source/code-of-conduct), we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or that happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the [Code of Conduct](/docs/licenses/open-source/code-of-conduct) or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include information that will help us start an investigation, such as:

- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (for example, a mailing list archive or Slack history) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?
All reports will be reviewed by New Relic’s open source steering committee.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to direct actions such as permanent ban from the project or community. Before any action is taken, we will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused.

In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.

We encourage New Relic employees to report any misconduct they may experience to Human Resources or to any senior manager through the reporting process outlined in our anti-harassment policy and training.
