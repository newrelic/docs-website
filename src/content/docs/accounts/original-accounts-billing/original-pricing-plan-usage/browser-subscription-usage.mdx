Original pricing plan

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see [SPA usage](#spa).

## Data generation [#data]

Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a `NrUsage` [event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type). Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour.

When querying Browser usage data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Browser`. For more information, see the [Browser query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrUsage` [event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type).
</Callout>

To view usage information in the UI:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) > View your usage**.
2. On the **Browser usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
3. Multiply the **Avg daily page views** by the number of days in the current month.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## Table definitions [#details]

</Table>

## Browser attributes

The following are usage-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute) generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Browser`.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "280px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `browserPageViewCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see [Data generation](#data).Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `productLine`
      </td>

      <td>
        The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is `Browser`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="usageType">
        `usageType`
      </td>

      <td>
        The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is `Application`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        browserAppId
      </td>

      <td>
        ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `isPrimaryApp`
      </td>

      <td>
        **Deprecated April 2, 2020.**

        Boolean. `true` means the application is the primary app. `false` means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see [Use multiple app names](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app).

        The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="page-views-last-month"
    title="Page views for the last complete month"
  >
    This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month:

    ```
    SELECT sum(usage) 
    FROM NrUsage 
    WHERE productLine='Browser' 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="views-week-by-app-account"
    title="Page views for the last week by account"
  >
    This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account:

    ```
    SELECT sum(usage) 
    FROM NrUsage 
    WHERE productLine='Browser' 
    SINCE 7 days ago 
    FACET consumingAccountName
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="views-week-by-app-account"
    title="Page views for the past month, by application:"
  >
    This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application

    ```
    SELECT sum(usage) 
    FROM NrUsage 
    WHERE productLine='Browser' 
    SINCE 30 days ago 
    FACET browserAppID
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts):

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrUsage 
    FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 1000 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## SPA usage [#spa]

Page views are used by [New Relic Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring) and explains why:

* SPA monitoring **does not** affect Browser data usage
* SPA monitoring **will** increase Insights data usage

In New Relic Browser, a **page view** is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the `window.onload` event.

New Relic's [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/understand-spa-data-collection) tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as:

* Route and hash changes
* Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript
* Dynamic server-side updates to a page

Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up [custom instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api#spa-api) you can capture almost any type of browser interaction.

With [New Relic Browser Pro](https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring/pricing), pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/understand-spa-data-collection) is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are **not** counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads.

### Notes on Insights subscription [#insights]

If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons:

* Page views create not only `PageView` events, but also `BrowserInteraction`, `AjaxRequest`, and `BrowserTiming` events.
* For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads.

If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of [events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type) generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available:

* Upgrade your Insights plan.
* [Turn off the reporting of some event types](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/event-data-retention).
* Use the [Browser API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api) to manually turn off collection of some events
* Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring
