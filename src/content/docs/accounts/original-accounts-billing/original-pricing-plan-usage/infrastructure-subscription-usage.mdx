<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

## Data generation [#data]

Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a `productLine` attribute value of `Infrastructure`. For more information, see [query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculation [#calculation]

Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see [CU-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#compute-unit).

If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
</Callout>

To view usage information in the UI:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **Infrastructure usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
3. Multiply the **Avg daily compute units** by the number of days in the current month.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## Table definitions [#details]

Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the **Group by** option selected at the top of the page.

## General attributes [#attributes]

The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute). These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products.

        * `cloud_provider_data`: Use the host size data from the cloud provider.
        * `missing_data`: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied.

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see [Intro to usage data](/docs/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cus-month-query"
    title="Compute units for last month"
  >
    This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month:

    ```
    SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' 
    AND usageType='Host' 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="host-report-query"
    title="Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report)"
  >
    This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI:

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT consumingAccountId 
    AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider 
    AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType 
    AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize 
    AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed 
    AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits 
    AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) 
    AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount 
    AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) 
    AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount 
    AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule 
    AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId 
    WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' 
    AND usageType='Host' 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 1000
    ```

    This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Detailed host query
          </th>

          <th>
            Comments
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Time period
          </td>

          <td>
            This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Results limited to 1000
          </td>

          <td>
            NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more `WHERE` clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, `WHERE agentHostname LIKE ...` to divide the data into groups).
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Business rule
          </td>

          <td>
            `Business rule` has been replaced with two attributes:

            * `infrastructureComputeUnitRule` defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (`update_agent_for_container_environment`).
            * `missingCpuData`, `missingRamData`, and `instanceSizeCapped` are now boolean flags describing what the value `missing_data` means when it is present in the `infrastructureComputeUnitRule` attribute.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"

    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

    ```
    SELECT count(*)

    LIMIT 1000
