<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

## Data generation [#data]

A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-[ping](/docs/synthetics-subscription-usage-attributes-queries#label) monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every [monitor type](#type). This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours.

All Synthetics usage events have a `productLine` attribute value of `Synthetics`. For more information, see the Synthetics [query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-[ping](/docs/synthetics-subscription-usage-attributes-queries#label) monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
</Callout>

To view usage information in the UI:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **Synthetics usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
3. Multiply the **Avg daily paid checks** by the number of days in the current month.

The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value **Avg daily paid checks** displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## General attributes [#attributes]

The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute). These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products.

## Synthetics attributes

The following are usage-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute) generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Synthetics`.

        `syntheticsFailedCheckCount`

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="billable-checks-last-month"
    title="Billable checks for the last month"
  >
    This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a `syntheticsType` of `SIMPLE` refers to a [ping monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/types-synthetics-monitors#types-monitors), which doesn't count towards paid usage.

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) 
    AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' 
    AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 1000 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
