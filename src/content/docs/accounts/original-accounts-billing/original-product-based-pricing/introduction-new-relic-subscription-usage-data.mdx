<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing model, see the [usage-based pricing docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), the usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how the subscription usage UI works, and how you can query and retrieve the usage data you need.

To view your usage data:

* If you are an account owner or admin, you can access subscription usage data in the New Relic UI.
* If you are not the account owner or admin, you can query usage data by using the [`NrDailyUsage` event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage).

## How it works [#about-usage]

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Owner and Admins**
</Callout>

The subscription usage UI shows how much a New Relic product is being used, and how that usage might affect your account's [subscription level and pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing). For example, you can see:

* How much your organization's departments or child accounts are contributing to billable New Relic usage. This is useful, for example, if your organization uses IT chargebacks.
* How close you are to going above your Insights Pro subscription level.

To understand your product usage, use any of these resources:

* View [**Usage** UI pages](#ui) to get an overview of your New Relic product usage.
* Download usage data CSVs and use other [UI features](#ui-features).
* Run [NRQL queries or use Insights query API calls](#nrql-queries) to retrieve focused usage data.

## View usage data in UI [#ui]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
</Callout>

To view New Relic subscription usage data:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
2. For an overview of account usage across all products, select **Usage**.
3. To view usage for a specific product, select its **Usage** page.

Every New Relic product has its own unit of measurement to calculate usage. For example, Mobile tracks monthly active users. Aside from the unit of measurement, the UI charts and features are similar for all products.

## UI features

Here are some of the general features available on New Relic usage UI pages. For product-specific UI and calculation details, see the [product usage documentation](#product-ui).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "240px" }}>
        If you want to...

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Switch time range
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the **Time picker** to switch between the view of the data from the current calendar month and the data from the last 30 days. All time measurements in the UI use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
      </td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Query usage data [#nrql-queries]

New Relic stores your usage data as an [`NrDailyUsage` event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). The usage charts have an associated NRQL query that is close to what you see in the UI.

For product-specific attributes and example NRQL queries, keep reading.

    title="APM CU-based subscription"
  >
    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    ### Data generation [#details]

    Once per day, an APM account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for:

    * Every application instance created over the last 24 hours
    * Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours

      These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Application`. To query the host events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Host`.

      All APM events use a `productLine` attribute value of `APM`. For more information, see [APM query examples](#query-examples).

      ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

      Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see [CU-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#compute-unit).

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
      </Callout>

      To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **APM usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.
    3. Multiply the **Avg daily compute units** by the number of days in the current month.

       For more information about the usage UI, see [Intro to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

       ### Table definitions [#details]

       Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the **Group by** option selected at the top of the page.

       <table>
         <thead>
           <tr>
             <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

             <td>
               Account name
             </td>

             <td>
               The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a [parent account](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts) or a [customer partnership](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions).

               Host ID
             </td>

             <td>
               The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see [`hostID`](/docs/apm-cu-based-usage-attributes-queries#hostid).
             </td>
           </tr>

           <tr>
             <td>
               Agent hostname
             </td>

             <td>
               The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see [`agentHostname`](/docs/apm-cu-based-usage-attributes-queries#agenthostname).
             </td>
           </tr>

           <tr>
             <td>

             </td>

             <td>
               The average daily [compute units](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#compute-unit) used.
             </td>
           </tr>

           <tr>
             <td>
               % of total usage
             </td>

             <td>
               The percentage of the total usage used.
             </td>
           </tr>
         </tbody>
       </table>

       ### Query examples

       Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data.

       <CollapserGroup>
         <Collapser
           id="last-month-query"
           title="Usage for last month"
         >
           ```
           SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Host' 
           AND productLine='APM' 
           SINCE last month 
           UNTIL this month
           ```
         </Collapser>

         <Collapser
           id="last-year-query"
           title="Monthly usage for last year"
         >
           ```
           SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits)
           FROM NrDailyUsage
           WHERE usageType='Host' 
           AND productLine='APM'
           FACET monthOf(timestamp) 
           SINCE 12 month ago limit 13
           ```
         </Collapser>

         <Collapser
           id="instance-hours-per-app-query"
           title="Instance-CUs per application"
         >
           This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage.

           Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity).

           ```
           SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Application' 
           AND productLine='APM' 
           FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName 
           SINCE 1 day ago 
           LIMIT 2000
           ```
         </Collapser>

         <Collapser title="Legacy host usage report">
           This query returns data once provided in the "host usage report": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI.

           ```
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           SELECT min(timestamp) 
           AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) 
           AS 'Latest reporting day' 
           FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
           WHERE usageType='Application' 
           AND productLine='APM' 
           SINCE 1 month ago 
           LIMIT 2000
           ```
         </Collapser>

         <Collapser
           id="legacy-per-host-query"
           title="Legacy per-host usage report"
         >
           This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system:

           ```
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           SELECT consumingAccountId 
           AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider 
           AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType 
           AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize 
           AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed 
           AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits 
           AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) 
           AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount 
           AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount 
           AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule 
           AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId 
           WHERE productLine='APM' 
           AND usageType='Host' 
           SINCE 1 day ago 
           LIMIT 2000
           ```

           This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report:

       ### Use of Docker or other containers [#containers]

       Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage.

       To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), [upgrade your APM agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent) to these versions:

    * **Go**: 1.11 or higher
    * **Java**: 3.42.0 or higher
    * **.NET**: 6.19.330.0 or higher
    * **Node.js**: 2.1.0 or higher
    * **PHP**: 7.5.0.199 or higher
    * **Python**: 2.90.0.75 or higher
    * **Ruby**: 4.4.0.336 or higher
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm-host-based"
    title="APM host-based subscription"
  >
    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have [host-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#host-based) (not [CU-based pricing](/docs/apm-cu-based-usage-attributes-queries)). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    ### Data generation [#details]

    Once per day, an APM account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) for:

    * Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours
    * Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours

      These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Application`. To query the host events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Host`.

      All APM events use a `productLine` attribute value of `APM`. For more information, see [APM query examples](#query-examples).

      ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

      For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of **equivalent hosts** used during that month. An **equivalent host** is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see [host-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#host-based).

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
      </Callout>

      To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **APM usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.
    3. See the **Avg daily equivalent hosts** for an account or grouping of accounts.

       The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time.

       ## Query examples

       Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

       <CollapserGroup>
         <Collapser
           id="last-month-query"
           title="Usage for last month"
         >
           This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month.

           ```
           SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 
           AS 'Equivalent hosts' 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Host'

           id="per-host-app-query"
           title="Usage per host per application"
         >
           New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment).

           ```
           SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Application'

         >
           This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage.

           Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity).

           ```
           SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Application' 
           AND productLine='APM'

    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see [SPA usage](#spa).

    ### Data generation [#data]

    Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a `NrUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour.

    When querying Browser usage data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Browser`. For more information, see the [Browser query examples](#query-examples).

    ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

    Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
    </Callout>

    To view usage information in the UI:

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > View your usage**.
    2. On the **Browser usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
    3. Multiply the **Avg daily page views** by the number of days in the current month.

       For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

       ### SPA usage [#spa]

       Page views are used by [New Relic Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring) and explains why:

    * SPA monitoring **does not** affect Browser data usage

    * SPA monitoring **will** increase Insights data usage

      In New Relic Browser, a **page view** is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the `window.onload` event.

      New Relic's [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/understand-spa-data-collection) tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as:

    * Route and hash changes

    * Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript

    * Dynamic server-side updates to a page

      Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up [custom instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api#spa-api) you can capture almost any type of browser interaction.

      With [New Relic Browser Pro](https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring/pricing), pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/understand-spa-data-collection) is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are **not** counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads.

      ### Notes on Insights subscription [#insights]

      If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons:

    * Page views create not only `PageView` events, but also `BrowserInteraction`, `AjaxRequest`, and `BrowserTiming` events.

    * For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads.

      If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of [events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available:

    * Upgrade your Insights plan.

    * [Turn off the reporting of some event types](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/event-data-retention).

    * Use the [Browser API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api) to manually turn off collection of some events

    * Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring

    id="mobile-usage"
    title="Mobile subscription"
  >
    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    ## Data generation [#data]

    Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours.

    To query Mobile usage data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Mobile`. For more information, see the [Mobile query examples](#query-examples).

    ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

    New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs).

    * For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a "user" for the purposes of this metric.
    * For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account.

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
      </Callout>

      To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **Mobile usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.

       The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage.

       For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

       ### Table definitions [#table]

       ### Query examples

       Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

           id="users-last-month"
           title="Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month"
         >
           A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month:

           ```
           SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' 
           SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day
           ```

           The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the `since` clause, for example:

           ```
           SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01'

           id="users-last-month-by-app"
           title="Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month"
         >
           A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name:

    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    ### Data generation [#data]

    Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a `productLine` attribute value of `Infrastructure`. For more information, see [query examples](#query-examples).

    ### Usage calculation [#calculation]

    Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see [CU-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#compute-unit).

    If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
    </Callout>

    To view usage information in the UI:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **Infrastructure usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
    3. Multiply the **Avg daily compute units** by the number of days in the current month.

           SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           WHERE productLine='Infrastructure'

           This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI:

           ```
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           SELECT consumingAccountId 
           AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider

           AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits 
           AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024)

           SINCE 1 day ago 
           LIMIT 1000
           ```

           This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report:

                 <td>
                   NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more `WHERE` clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, `WHERE agentHostname LIKE ...` to divide the data into groups).

    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains:

    * How New Relic calculates billable usage for an [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro).
    * Available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls.

      ### Data generation [#data]

      Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every [event namespace](#namespace). A `NrDailyUsage` event includes a count of the events under that namespace.

      To view the attributes for this event, see the `NrDailyUsage` [entry in the data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage).

      ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
      </Callout>

      To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **Insights usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.

       For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

       The Insights usage UI only displays **paid events**: these are events that count towards an [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro). It does **not** display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also [query the product included events](#query-examples).

       How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's [data retention period](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention). For a list of the applicable event types, see [Event namespaces](#namespace).

       ### Table definitions [#details]

       Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the **Group by** option you select in the UI.

       ### Event namespaces (types) [#namespace]

       An [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro) governs the data retention of certain types of events. An event's namespace (indicated by the [`insightsEventNamespace`](#insightsEventNamespace) attribute) corresponds to one or more event types that share a single [data retention](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components) policy.

       ### Query examples

       To get the most out of your Insights usage data, you can:

    * Run queries of this data and create custom charts and dashboards.
    * Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs.

      For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see [Introduction to usage data](/docs/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Insights writes usage events [once per day](#data). That is why these queries use `since 24 hours ago` or `timeseries 1 day`.
      </Callout>

      Here are some NRQL query examples about usage.

      <CollapserGroup>
        <Collapser
          id="example-account-events"
          title="Stored event usage for last month"

          This query will tell you the "billable" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events.

          ```
          SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) 
          AS 'Paid events' 
          FROM NrDailyUsage

        >
          This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by [event namespace](#insightsEventNamespace). Be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in these queries with your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

          ```
          SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount)

          WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID 
          FACET insightsEventNamespace
          ```

          This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces:

          id="example-multiple-accounts"
          title="Current Insights usage for multiple accounts"
        >
          This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by [event namespace](#insightsEventNamespace). Note that you will need to replace LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs in the query with a list of [account IDs](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

          ```
          SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) 
          FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago

          FACET consumingAccountId, insightsEventNamespace 
          LIMIT 100

    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this explains how we calculate billable usage for accounts using synthetic monitoring. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

    ### Data generation [#data]

    A synthetic monitoring subscription level is based on the number of non-[ping](/docs/synthetics-subscription-usage-attributes-queries#label) monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every synthetic monitor location will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every [monitor type](#type). This event will summarize synthetic monitoring usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours.

    All synthetics usage events have a `productLine` attribute value of `Synthetics`. For more information, see the synthetics [query examples](#query-examples).

    ### Usage calculations [#calculation]

    A synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-[ping](/docs/synthetics-subscription-usage-attributes-queries#label) monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
    </Callout>

    To view usage information in the UI:

    1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).
    2. On the **Synthetics usage** page, set the time picker to **Last 30 days**.
    3. Multiply the **Avg daily paid checks** by the number of days in the current month.

       The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value **Avg daily paid checks** displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days.

       For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

       ### Query examples

       Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your synthetic monitoring subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

       <CollapserGroup>
         <Collapser
           id="billable-checks-last-month"
           title="Billable checks for the last month"
         >
           This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a `syntheticsType` of `SIMPLE` refers to a [ping monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/types-synthetics-monitors#types-monitors), which doesn't count towards paid usage.

           ```
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) 
           AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' 
           AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' 
           SINCE last month 
           UNTIL this month
           ```
         </Collapser>

         <Collapser
           id="account-hierarchy-query"
           title="Account hierarchy"
         >
           This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

           ```
           SELECT count(*) 
           FROM NrDailyUsage 
           FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
           LIMIT 1000 
           SINCE 1 day ago
           ```
         </Collapser>
