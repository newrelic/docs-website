  This doc references our original product-based pricing model. For more about pricing changes, see [Overview of our pricing models](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan/).
</Callout>

Some of our older customers may not have had an opportunity to update their pricing model yet and are still on our <DNT>**original pricing model**</DNT>. Our newer pricing model, sometimes referred to as the <DNT>**New Relic One pricing model**</DNT>, is much simpler and offers many benefits compared to our original pricing model ([learn more](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing)). This doc explains the options available for switching to the newer pricing model.

## How free accounts switch

Using New Relic for free on our original pricing model? You currently have access to a wide range of New Relic features. We currently don't have a way to convert free, non-paying customer accounts to the new pricing model. So to get on the newer pricing model, and take advantage of the those benefits, you'll need to [sign up for a new account](https://newrelic.com/signup).

[Learn what you get for free on the new pricing model.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free)

## How paying accounts switch to new pricing [#transition-paid]

If your organization is on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) and you are paying us, you can only switch to our newer usage-based pricing if one of these is true:

* You're on month-to-month billing.
* You're within 60 days of your subscription renewal.

If one of those is true, you might have access to a self-serve pricing migration in the UI. To use that UI:

1. To find the UI option: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT> and then click <DNT>**Plans and pricing**</DNT> ([direct link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjI0NDEyODYsIm5lcmRsZXRJZCI6ImNvbW1lcmNlLW5lcmRsZXRzLm5yLXNob3AtZW50cnkiLCJwYXRoIjoiL3BsYW5zLWFuZC1wcmljaW5nIiwibWlncmF0aW9uRWxpZ2libGUiOnRydWUsImFjY291bnROYW1lIjoiU3RyYWRvcyBMYWJzIn0=&platform[accountId]=)). If you don't see an <DNT>**Unlock full platform access**</DNT> UI, contact your account representative or ask a question in the [Support Forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com/).
2. Consider the new billing factors. Our usage-based pricing model bills on data ingest and the number of billable users. This means that you'll likely want to downgrade some of your users to be basic users. Keep reading to learn more about these considerations and ensure you won't run into billing surprises.

### Downgrading users

For organizations on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), the count of [core users and full platform users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) is a billing factor.

For organizations on our original pricing model, by default all users are full platform users, because user count isn't a billing factor for that model. So before you switch to our newer pricing model, you'll want to ensure that your users have the user types you want. To learn more about determining user type, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). Ideally, you'll want to update your users before switching to the new pricing.

How you'll review and update your users will differ depending on what user model you're on. If you're on our original pricing model, you're likely also on our original user model, but if you're not sure which you are on, see [Overview of user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models):

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="original-model"
    title="Our original user model: update users"
  >
    To update your users, you must have admin permissions for managing users.

    Steps for reviewing and updating your users:

    1. If your organization has multiple accounts, make sure that you're aware of all child accounts and review all users on those accounts. It's possible for you to log into a sub-account and not see all your users. To see your associated accounts: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Account settings**</DNT>, and look for associated accounts.
    2. To see a count of billable users for an account: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**View your usage**</DNT> and see the <DNT>**Users**</DNT> chart. This shows <DNT>**all**</DNT> billable users and, for some organizations, that will include users on child accounts. Be sure to update users across all your accounts because users by default start out as billable full platform users.
    3. To update your users: from that page click <DNT>**Manage users**</DNT> and edit the user type field.

### Understand data ingest [#understand-usage]

For our newer pricing model, data ingest is one billing factor. To better understand your data ingest, here are some tips:

* Use our [data ingest cost estimator](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost).
* Go to the data ingest UI: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Manage your data**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Data ingestion**</DNT>.
* To do more in-depth analysis than the UI provides, use [NRQL queries of your usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts). Here's an example of breaking down [`Metric` data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) by the top 10 metric names. Note that some metrics are not data ingest metrics and are not billable. To run different analyses, you might also try faceting by `appName` or `Host`.
  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' 
  SINCE 7 DAYS AGO 
  FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day
  ```
  For more queries, see [Usage queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts). For more about `bytecountestimate()`, see [Byte count estimate](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/#byte-count-estimate).
* One of our open source New Relic apps is the [Data ingestion breakdown app](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/account-data-ingestion/51e66f0d-153c-493c-a75c-a386c3f170ce).

## Migrate users to new user model [#migrate-users]

If your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models), you may have the ability to [migrate your users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/).
