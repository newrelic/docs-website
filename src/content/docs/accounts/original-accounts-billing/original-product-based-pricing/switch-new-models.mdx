New Relic has recently implemented a new pricing model and account/user structure (read an [overview of changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/)). Our new models have many benefits: simpler billing, ability to add free users, simplicity of managing users, and more. 

If you're on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) or if your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), this doc will explain how you can move to the new models. 


## How free accounts switch

Have a free account? You currently have access to all of New Relic One. However, if youâ€™d like to take advantage of the new pricing and account/user models, please [sign up for a new account](https://newrelic.com/signup/).

## How paying accounts migrate users to new model [#migrate-users]

If your users are on our [original user model](#user-models), you may have the ability to [migrate your users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/). Some organizations cannot yet do this. 

## How paying accounts switch to new pricing [#transition-paid]

If you're a paying account on our original pricing plan, you may only switch to the new pricing if one of these is true: 

* You're on month-to-month billing.
* You're within 60 days of your subscription renewal. 

If one of those is true, you may have access to a self-serve pricing migration in the UI. To find that: from the account dropdown, click **Manage your plan** and then click **Plans and pricing** ([direct link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjI0NDEyODYsIm5lcmRsZXRJZCI6ImNvbW1lcmNlLW5lcmRsZXRzLm5yLXNob3AtZW50cnkiLCJwYXRoIjoiL3BsYW5zLWFuZC1wcmljaW5nIiwibWlncmF0aW9uRWxpZ2libGUiOnRydWUsImFjY291bnROYW1lIjoiU3RyYWRvcyBMYWJzIn0=&platform[accountId]=)). If you don't see that UI, contact your account representative, if you have one. 

Have more questions? You can ask in the [Explorer's Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/). 

Note that switching to the new pricing plan means that your billing is different ([read more about New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/)). Below are some tips on how to understand how your data ingest and count of full users may impact billing. 

### Understand data ingest 

Your data ingest is one factor in [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/). To better understand your data ingest, here are some tips:

* From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **Manage your data**, then click **Data ingestion**. This page gives you an overview of your current data ingestion over the last 30 days. 
* If you want to see a view over a long time, go to the time picker on the right side of the page, where it says **Since 30 days ago** and select a different time range.
* To see more detail on ingest, scroll down to see an ingest breakdown.

### Understand count of full users

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), your count of full users is one factor in billing. 

If you're on our original pricing plan, you started out with all full users, by default, which means it's probable you have more full users than you need. You will want to think about downgrading some full users to basic users. To learn more about determining whether a user should be basic or full, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type).

To see your count of full users: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **View your usage**. 

To edit your users' user type, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#manage-users).
