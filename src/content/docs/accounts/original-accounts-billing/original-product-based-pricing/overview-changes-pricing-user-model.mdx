In 2020, New Relic switched to a new pricing plan and a new account/user model. This doc explains:

* [Overview of pricing and user model](#how-pricing-users-relate)
* [Pricing plan changes](#pricing-plans)
* [Account/user model changes](#user-models)
* How to [transition from original pricing to the newer pricing](#how-to-transition).

## Overview of pricing and user models [#how-pricing-users-relate]

In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan, which controls your billing, and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure.

If you have a New Relic [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) created after July 30, 2020, you're on our [newer pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) and [newer user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure). But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related. For example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model. Or you might be on our original pricing plan and have users on our newer user model.

Keep reading to learn about our [pricing plans](#pricing-plans) and our [user models](#user-models), how to figure out which you're on, and what the impacts are. For a table showing how pricing plan and user model relate, see [Pricing and user model relationship](#pricing-user-table).

## Pricing plan changes explained [#pricing-plans]

New Relic [organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) are on one of two pricing plans:

* [New Relic One pricing](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise), GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable "full users." All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to [transition to this pricing](#how-to-transition).
* Our original [product-based pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to [transition to the newer pricing plan](#how-to-transition): in that case, their users remain on our [original user model](#user-models).

### Determine pricing plan using UI [#determine-pricing]

To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com), select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **Manage your plan**. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan.

## Account/user model changes explained [#user-models]

In this context, we use "user model" to refer to the data structure of a New Relic user and how it interacts with the broader account/organization that it's in.

We have two user models:

* **New Relic One user model**: this newer, improved user model has the following feature that are different from the original user model:
  * All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level [organization](/docs/new-relic-account-structure). This gives an organization strong control over managing users and what they can access.
  * Users on [this model are managed differently](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users) than are users on the original user model.
  * There's no longer an account "owner" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model.
* **Original user model**: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model:
  * There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login.
  * Users on the [original user model are managed differently](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model) than are users on the newer model.

To learn what user model your users are on and how that relates to pricing, see the [Pricing and user model table](#pricing-user-table).

### Determine user model using UI [#determine-user-model]

To determine what user model you're on, from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) select **User preferences**. if you see the UI below, you're on the newer New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with much more content, you're on the original user model (see [original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles)).

![New Relic One user model - user preferences](./images/new-relic-one-user-model-user-preferences.png "new-relic-user-preferences-new-user-model.png")

To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

### Alert-related impacts [#limitations]

Users on the New Relic One user model have the following alerting-related impact:

* Alert notifications: These users won’t show up as options when [choosing users to receive alert notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts#user). Instead, you can [use their email address](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts#email).

## Transition to the new pricing plan [#how-to-transition]

If you want to switch to New Relic One pricing:

* Have a paid account? Speak to your New Relic account representative. As part of that process, you will need to [transition your users](#convert-users).
* Have a free account? You currently have access to all of New Relic One. However, if you’d like to transition to the new pricing, please [sign up for a new account](https://newrelic.com/signup/). On sign up, a Standard tier account includes the following for free:
  * One [full user](/docs/users-roles#user-type) with access to Full-Stack Observability
  * 100 GBs of ingested data per month
  * 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month

To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see [New Relic pricing](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

### Transition your users [#convert-users]

If you are switching to New Relic One pricing, your users are probably on our [original user model](#user-models) (some users who are added via automated user management are on the newer user model: see [AUM user conversion](#convert-aum)). Your original user model users will remain on that user model, with all associated [roles and management options](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).

In addition, for the purposes of billing, they're also newly categorized by [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type): full user or basic user. Your users start out as full users, which are billable. For users you want to have basic, limited access to New Relic, you can set them as basic users, which are free. When you set a user to basic user, or to full user, that user's type is changed across all accounts in that New Relic organization. For tips on how to decide which users to make basic or full, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type).

<Callout variant="important">
  Caveats for original user model users:

  * Your basic users will temporarily have the same permissions as full users, but basic user limits will be enforced in the near future.
  * Your basic users do **not** have the option to self-serve upgrade to become a full user. They must be upgraded by your New Relic admin.
</Callout>

To manage users, you must be an Admin or Owner. To change a full user to a basic user:

1. From the [account dropdown](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) at top right, click **Account settings**, then click **Users and roles**.
2. Select a user and change the user type to **Basic user**.

### Transition users who were added via AUM [#convert-aum]

If you have users added via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) (provisioned using your identity provider), then your users are on the newer Relic One user model. To see this explained in diagram form, see [Pricing and user model table](#pricing-user-table).

Even though these users are on the newer user model, they lack some new roles/capabilities. If you want these users to be able to manage users, you will need to grant them these roles. To do this, talk to your New Relic account representative. Once you are set up, you can follow the standard instructions for [managing user groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants).

## How pricing and user model relate [#pricing-user-table]

As explained in the [pricing and user model overview](#how-pricing-users-relate), your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other:
