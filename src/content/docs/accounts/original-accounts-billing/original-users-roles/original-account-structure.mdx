This doc is about organizations on our original user model, not the [New Relic One model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/).

Since July 30, 2020, new signups to New Relic are on our New Relic One user model. Older customers who have not yet [migrated to the new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/) are still on our original user model. The original user model will be increasingly deprecated as more New Relic customers are migrated to the new model.

Note that the user model is not directly related to our two different [pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans).

Here are some important aspects of the original user model and links to important docs: 

* Our original user model did not have firm boundaries between organizations/customers, and was much more user-centric. This meant that a user could be granted access to data from different organizations, and could access that data from a single login. [Read more about the differences between the old and new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 
* On the original user model, a user’s access to accounts is based on: a) being added to a specific account, or b) having access to a parent account and inheriting access to that account’s child accounts. See our [original user management docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). See an [explanation of how parent/child accounts work](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure).
