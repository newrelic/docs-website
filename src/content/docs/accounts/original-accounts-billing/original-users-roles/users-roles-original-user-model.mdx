Original  
user  
model

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc contains information about how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which pricing plan or user model you're on? See [Overview of pricing plan and user models](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan).
</Callout>

## View and manage users

To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**, and select **Users and roles**.

Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins.

## User types: basic user and full user

On the [Users and roles](#view-access) UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. **This only affects your account if you've switched to the** **[New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing)**, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. To learn more, see [Transition to new pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan#convert-users).

You can also [bulk update changes to user type](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users).

## Account roles

A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Account role**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Owner
      </td>

      <td>
        The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all [billing queries](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options). The Owner has [complete access to all of the account information](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options#self-serve). The Owner can also [install and configure the New Relic agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents), and they can enable or set up features.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Admins
      </td>

      <td>
        One or more individuals who can [add, edit, and delete account users](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/add-update-users). Admins can also [install and configure the New Relic agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents), and they can enable or set up features.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Users
      </td>

      <td>
        One or more individuals who use (and optionally set up) the available New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Restricted Users
      </td>

      <td>
        One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features.

        The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic [session settings](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-maintenance/setting-session-timeouts) so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to [Kiosk](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-new-relic-ui-page-functions#kiosk) mode.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Add-on roles

With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account.

Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of **Admin** capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to [subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/discover-manage-applications-new-relic-one-catalog) to an account.

There are two types of add-on roles:

* **Add-on Manager roles** are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a [User](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) or [Restricted User](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product.
* **Custom add-on roles** can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of [Users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) could have the ability to acknowledge [incidents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/acknowledge-alert-incidents) and [close violations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/close-violations-manually) in [New Relic Alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts), but not have the ability to modify your existing alert [preferences](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).

Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts.

Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="view-roles"
    title="View roles"
  >
    To view the list of individuals [assigned to your account and their current roles](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users): Go to **[account dropdown](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-role"
    title="Assign a managed role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner and Admins**
    </Callout>

    Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them [Admin-level permissions for the assigned product](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles). They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name.
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select the type of manager role for the user.
    4. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the **Capabilities preview** chart.

    Features in the **Capabilities preview** chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a [CSV file](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users).
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="create"
    title="Create a custom role"
  >
    To create a custom add-on role for your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. Select **<i className="fa fa-plus-circle">
       plus-circle
       </i>
       New custom add-on role**.
    3. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then **Create role**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-custom"
    title="Assign a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ].
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select a custom role for the user.
    4. Click **Update user**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit"
    title="Edit or delete a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. From the **Add-on roles** list, select the custom add-on role, then select **<i className="fa fa-pencil">
       pencil
       </i>
       Edit role** or **<i className="fa fa-trash-o">
       trash-o
       </i>
       Delete role** as appropriate.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Account permissions

Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a [master account with sub-accounts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/create-sub-accounts) automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive [email notifications for alerts or weekly reports](#alert-rights) for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts.
