For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users.

## Requirements [#who-is-doc-for]

This doc and the surrounding [section of docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles) shows you how to manage users who are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models). If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the [New Relic One user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles)).

One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the [**Users and roles** UI](#view-access), those users are on our original user model.

Want to learn more about user model changes? See [Overview of user models](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan).

## View and manage users in UI [#view-access]

If your New Relic account has users on our [original user model](#who-is-doc-for), you can use the **Users and roles** UI. To access this UI: select the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**, and select **Users and roles**.

Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use the [New Relic REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/account-examples-v2/listing-users-your-account) to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account.
</Callout>

Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="view-pending"
    title="View pending SAML SSO users"
  >
    New Relic accounts with [SAML Single Sign On (SSO)](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers) may have a list of **Pending users**. These are individuals who have been [added to the SAML-enabled account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/adding-users-saml-accounts) but have not yet confirmed.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="adding_users"
    title="Add a new user"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner or Admins**
    </Callout>

    To add a new user to your New Relic account:

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. In the upper right corner, click **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       New user**.
    3. Enter the appropriate name and email address.
    4. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted.
    5. Select **Add user**.

    The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic.

    <Callout variant="important">
      New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update-user-type"
    title="Update user type"
  >
    To update a user's type (basic user or full user):

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Select a user and edit its type.

    You can also [bulk update user type changes](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users).

    For more about this, see [User type](#user-type).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="updating"
    title="Update account roles"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner or Admins**
    </Callout>

    To update a person's role and capabilities:

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Select the person's name.
    3. Under **Roles and capabilities**, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted.

    The account Owner must [update the Owner role](#owner).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="deleting"
    title="Delete a user"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner or Admins**
    </Callout>

    To remove a user from your New Relic account:

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Click on the name of the person you would like to update.
    3. Click **<Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       Delete User**.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk [via CSV file](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users).
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="owner"
    title="Update the account Owner"
  >
    A New Relic account can have only one Owner [role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the [current Owner is unavailable](#no-owner), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

    You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin.

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
    2. Above the Active users list, select <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
       **Change owner**. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available.
    3. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account.
    4. Refresh the page for changes to take effect.

    Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role.

    To find out who is the current assigned Owner:

    1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
    2. View the **Base role** column to locate your account Owner.

    The <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
    **Change owner** button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

</CollapserGroup>

## User types: basic user and full user [#user-type]

On the [Users and roles](#view-access) UI page, users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model) are categorized by user type: full user or basic user. Impacts of user type:

* If you've switched to [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), the number of full users is a factor in your billing. Otherwise, it's not a factor. To learn more, see [Transition to new pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan#convert-users).
* Your basic users temporarily do not have restrictions enforced and so have the same permissions as full users. Basic user restrictions will be enforced in the near future.

For how to edit this, see [Update user type](#update-user-type).

## Account roles [#roles]

A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Account role**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Owner
      </td>

      <td>
        The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all [billing queries](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options). The Owner has [complete access to all of the account information](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options#self-serve).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        User
      </td>

      <td>
        Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Restricted User
      </td>

      <td>
        One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features.

        The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic [session settings](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-maintenance/setting-session-timeouts) so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to [Kiosk](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-new-relic-ui-page-functions#kiosk) mode.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Add-on roles [#add-on]

With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account.

Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of **Admin** capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to [subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/discover-manage-applications-new-relic-one-catalog) to an account.

There are two types of add-on roles:

* **Add-on Manager roles** are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a [User](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) or [Restricted User](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product.
* **Custom add-on roles** can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of [Users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) could have the ability to acknowledge [incidents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/acknowledge-alert-incidents) and [close violations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/close-violations-manually) in [New Relic Alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts), but not have the ability to modify your existing alert [preferences](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).

Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts.

Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="view-roles"
    title="View roles"
  >
    To view the list of individuals [assigned to your account and their current roles](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users): Go to **[account dropdown](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-role"
    title="Assign a managed role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner and Admins**
    </Callout>

    Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them [Admin-level permissions for the assigned product](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles). They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name.
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select the type of manager role for the user.
    4. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the **Capabilities preview** chart.

    Features in the **Capabilities preview** chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a [CSV file](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users).
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="create"
    title="Create a custom role"
  >
    To create a custom add-on role for your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       New custom add-on role**.
    3. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then **Create role**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-custom"
    title="Assign a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ].
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select a custom role for the user.
    4. Click **Update user**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit"
    title="Edit or delete a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account:

    1. Go to **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. From the **Add-on roles** list, select the custom add-on role, then select **<Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       Edit role** or **<Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       Delete role** as appropriate.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Account permissions [#account-rights]

Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a [master account with sub-accounts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/create-sub-accounts) automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive [email notifications for alerts or weekly reports](#alert-rights) for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts.
