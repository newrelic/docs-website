For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): how user roles and permissions work on this model, and how to add and manage users.

## Requirements  [#who-is-doc-for]

This section of docs shows you how to manage users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models). If you can see users in the [**Users and roles** UI](#view-access), those users are on our original user model.

There are limits on how many sessions and IP addresses a New Relic user can have. For details, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data#session-limits).

## Updates about our new user model [#migrate]

In July of 2020, we released a [new user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) that offers many [benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/user-management-and-access-security). At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able [to self-serve the migration of their users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration). We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated.

One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having both their original login method and records and a user record on the newer model. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#account-access).

<figcaption>
  If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a "multiple accounts found" note when logging in.
</figcaption>

## View and manage users in UI [#view-access]

The **Users and roles** UI is used for managing users on our [original user model](#who-is-doc-for). To find this UI: click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Account settings**, and then click **Users and roles**.

If you're on our newer usage-based pricing model, see some [important considerations](#full-user-count).

You can also use the [New Relic REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/account-examples-v2/listing-users-your-account) to get a list of users for an account.

Here are instructions and considerations for some common user management tasks and scenarios:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="adding_users"
    title="Add a new user"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner or Admins**
    </Callout>

    Note that if you're adding users on our [original user model](#who-is-doc-for) to an organization that has multiple accounts, you'll want to think about which account you add users to, because the [account structure impacts what users have access to](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure).

    To add a new user to a New Relic account:

    1. For the account you want to add a user to, go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. In the upper right corner, click **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       New user**.
    3. Enter the appropriate name and email address.
    4. Select their [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). Note that the user type is a billing factor if you're on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing).
    5. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted.
    6. Select **Add user**.

       The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic.

       <Callout variant="important">
         New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features.
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="full-user-count"
    title="Manage billable users"
  >
    If you're on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), the user types of your users are a factor in your billing.

    If you have multiple accounts in your organization, here are some important considerations when managing billable users on the original user model:

    * You aren't able to see all your organization's users in a single UI. If your goal is to review and edit all your users (for example, editing their [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) for billing purposes), you must go to the **Users and roles** UI for each individual account. (Note that the ability to more easily manage your users is one benefit of our [newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).)
    * Because of the above point, the count of billable users you see in the **View your usage** UI may not match the number of users you see when you go to a specific account's **Users and roles** UI.
    * You can be charged for billable users in all accounts in your organization, regardless of whether those accounts are marked as "active" or "inactive" (not reporting data) in the **Account settings** UI.

      For tips on editing user type, see [Manage user type](#update-user-type).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update-user-type"
    title="Manage user type and user upgrades"
  >
    Some important tips for managing user type:

    * If you're on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models), your users' [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) is a billing factor.
    * If you upgrade a user to a higher user type (either via the UI or via an upgrade request email), their user type is changed across all accounts in the organization.

    To update your users' user type:

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Select a user and edit their type, or [bulk update the type for multiple users](#bulk). Note that if your organization has multiple accounts, you can't see all your users in a single UI location: to manage users across in different accounts, you'll have to go to the **Users and roles** UI for each account. 

    To view and approve users who have requested an upgrade:

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
    2. Click **Upgrade requests**. Note that if your organization has multiple accounts, you can't see all your users in a single UI location: to manage users across in different accounts, you'll have to go to the **Users and roles** UI for each account.

    To control how users upgrade, from the **Users and roles** UI, you can select **Access requests**. You have two options:

    * **Automatic approval**: With this option, users can automatically and immediately upgrade their user type. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems.
    * **Require review**: With this option, your admins get a notification email when users request an upgrade and the admins must upgrade them first. They can be approved either from the notification email or from the user's record in the **Users and roles** UI.

    For more about user type, see [User type](#user-type).

  <Collapser

    title="View pending SAML SSO users"
  >
    If your organization has implemented [SAML Single Sign On](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers), you may have a list of **Pending users**. These are users who have been [added to the SAML-enabled account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/adding-users-saml-accounts) but have not yet confirmed. 

    For organizations on our [newer usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) and have users on our original user model, these `Pending invite` users are not billable. (If they're on our newer user model, `Pending invite` users are billable).

    To update a person's role and capabilities:

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Select the person's name.
    3. Under **Roles and capabilities**, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted.

       The account Owner must [update the Owner role](#owner).

    To remove a user from your New Relic account:

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. Click on the name of the person you would like to update.
    3. Click **<Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       Delete User**.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk [via CSV file](#bulk).
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="owner"
    title="Update the account Owner"
  >
    The Owner role concept exists only for users on our original user model.

    A New Relic account can have only one Owner [role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the [current Owner is unavailable](#no-owner), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

    You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin.

    1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.

    2. Above the Active users list, select <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
       **Change owner**. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available.

    3. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account.

    4. Refresh the page for changes to take effect.

       Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role.

       To find out who is the current assigned Owner:

    5. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.

    6. View the **Base role** column to locate your account Owner.

       The <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
       **Change owner** button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## User type [#user-type]

For organizations on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models), the user type is a billing factor. 

A user's user type is what governs their maximum allowed set of New Relic capabilities. In practice, users will often have [roles](#roles) assigned to them that limit their capabilities in various ways, but the user type represents their maximum theoretical set of capabilities. For more information, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

If a user in your organization is set as different user types in different accounts, the user is considered as whatever their highest user type is.

For how to edit a user's type, see [Manage user type](#update-user-type).

## Account roles [#roles]

Here are our default available roles:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Account role**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Owner
      </td>

      <td>
        The person who initially creates a New Relic account and receives all [billing queries](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options). A New Relic account can have only one Owner. The Owner has [complete access to all of the account information](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/account-pricing-billing-options#self-serve).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Admin
      </td>

      <td>
        Can [add, edit, and delete users](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/add-update-users), and can enable or set up features.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        User
      </td>

      <td>
        Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Restricted User
      </td>

      <td>
        One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features.

        The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic [session settings](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-maintenance/setting-session-timeouts) so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to [Kiosk](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-new-relic-ui-page-functions#kiosk) mode.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Add-on roles [#add-on]

Add-on roles let you grant more specific and granular access to your users. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access grants them the equivalent of **Admin** capabilities for that feature category. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User and assign them the **APM manager** role to give them APM capabilities.

Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account.

We have the following add-on manager roles:

* Alerts manager
* APM manager
* Applied intelligence manager
* Browser manager
* Data retention manager
* Incident intelligence manager
* Incident workflows manager
* Infrastructure manager
* Insights manager
* Invite teammate email manager
* Logs manager
* Mobile manager
* Nerdpack manager
* Synthetics manager
* Trace observer manager
* Workloads manager

To understand the capabilities that a role has, go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles** and select a specific role. To see descriptions of specific capabilities, go to [Capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities).

* Create, duplicate, modify, or delete [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-observe-your-full-stack#create).
* Link [dashboards](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-observe-your-full-stack#add-dashboards) to workloads and save filters.

To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.

To see descriptions of specific capabilities, go to [Capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities).

## Manage custom and add-on roles

Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles:

    To view the list of individuals [assigned to your account and their current roles](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users): Go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-role"
    title="Assign a managed role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owner and Admins**
    </Callout>

    Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them [Admin-level permissions for the assigned product](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles). They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name.
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select the type of manager role for the user.
    4. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the **Capabilities preview** chart.

       Features in the **Capabilities preview** chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a [CSV file](#bulk).
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="create"
    title="Create a custom role"
  >
    To create a custom add-on role for your account:

    1. Go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       New custom add-on role**.
    3. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then **Create role**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="assign-custom"
    title="Assign a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account:

    1. Go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Users**.
    2. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ].
    3. Under **Add-on roles**, select a custom role for the user.
    4. Click **Update user**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit"
    title="Edit or delete a custom role"
  >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners and Admins**
    </Callout>

    You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account:

    1. Go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles**.
    2. From the **Add-on roles** list, select the custom add-on role, then select **<Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       Edit role** or **<Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
       Delete role** as appropriate.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Account permissions [#account-rights]

The table below gives a summary of roles and their permissions. Note that these are roles applicable only for our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).

Users in a [parent account](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure) have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, those users won't receive [email notifications for alerts or weekly reports](#alert-rights) for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts.

## Bulk user management [#bulk]

With the **Bulk user actions** feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for:

* adding roles when multiple new employees start
* deleting roles when multiple employees leave
* giving multiple employees Admin roles

### Update users in bulk [#update]

Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions:

* You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role.
* You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name.
* You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost).

To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models):

1. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Users and roles**, and add `/bulk_actions` at the end of the URL.

   Example URL:

   ```
   https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions
   ```
2. Download a **Backup CSV file**. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally.
3. Download a **CSV of users** or a **CSV template**. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: `account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29`
4. Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change.
