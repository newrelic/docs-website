Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model.

## Background [#background]

On July 30, 2020, we released a new, improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts.

At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some [requirements](#requirements) can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have [new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).

## Benefits [#benefits]

When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include:

* Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place.
* Fewer steps to add and manage users.
* Flexible authentication options.
* More granular roles for user management.
* For Pro and Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers.

[Learn more about the benefits of our new user model.](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/user-management-and-access-security/)

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include:

* You must be on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). If you aren't sure which you are, see [Determine user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models/#determine-user-model).
* To use the user migration wizard, you must have the [Owner role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).

## Determine if you should migrate users [#recommendations]

We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. **These considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative**; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance.

We recommend **not** using the user migration wizard in these circumstances:

* If your organization has more than 30 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 30 or more [accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), **not** users.
* If you frequently [add accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/mastersub-account-structure/#creating). Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts.
* If you think any of the [new user model impacts and limitations](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models/#differences) might affect you negatively.
* If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an entire organization and can't be assigned to specific accounts.

If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative.

## Optional: review your users' user type [#user-type]

For organizations on the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), your users' [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) is a billing factor.

Whether you're currently on the New Relic One pricing model, or plan to soon [switch to that pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models), it may make sense to edit your users' user type before doing the user migration. One reason for that is that the original **Users and roles** UI allows you to see the time of your users' last use of New Relic (the new UI does not yet have this ability), and that can be useful for determining which user type to make them. For tips on how to do this, see [Edit user type](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#full-user-count).

## Optional: Understand user management concepts [#before-beginning]

During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to control your users' access to specific accounts or specific roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the new user management concepts. Here's a brief summary:

* Users are in a container called an "authentication domain". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods.
* Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default **Admin** group or a custom group like **Contractors**). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups.
* When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an **access grant**. For example, you may give a **Contractors** group access to our default **All product admin** role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role.

To learn more, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts).

You can edit and adjust your access grants after you've done the migration, but if you wanted to plan that out first, here are some tips for that:

* For organizations with a high number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the [**Organization manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles) (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the [**Authentication domain manager**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles) (user management capabilities), a group with the [**Billing user**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles) (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts.
* Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups.
* For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups.

## Start the user migration process [#find]

Before you start, be sure you've read [the requirements](#requirements) and the other recommendations above. To start using the wizard:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Apps** in the top navigation.
2. In the table of apps, click the **User migration walkthrough** app.
3. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages.

If you've successfully completed migration, learn [how to manage your users](#manage-users).

## Step 1: Create admins [#page1]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-1.png"
  alt="User migration page 1"
  src={userMigrationPage1}
/>

Tips:

* Check the **Accounts included** dropdown. Note that the user migration will only apply to the account selected. This means if your organization has multiple accounts, you should do the migration process for each of them.
* You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process.
* If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below:
  <img title="Login UI for email addresses with multiple user records" alt="A screenshot of what is shown when you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic logins" src={loginMultipleAccountsView}/>
  <figcaption>If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records.</figcaption>
* If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your original user model users.

## Step 2: Set up organization [#page2]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-2.png"
  alt="User migration page 2"
  src={userMigrationPage2}
/>

You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup:

* It won't transition SSO or [SCIM configurations](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign). Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password.
* It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or SCIM provisioning today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option.

## Step 3: Name your organization [#page3]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-3.png"
  alt="User migration page 3"
  src={userMigrationPage3}
/>

Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable.

## Step 4: Authentication domain settings [#page4]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-4.png"
  alt="User migration page 4"
  src={userMigrationPage4}
/>

This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI and in your identity provider.

Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections:

### Managing users [#managing-users]

For how users are added and managed, you can select **Manually** or **Identity provider** (SCIM). The option to use your identity provider to provision users via SCIM is available only if your organization has [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

If you choose **Identity provider**, **you must follow the [steps for automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign#how-to)**. Once you complete those steps return to the user migration wizard and docs. Once you complete this step, we highly recommend completing the user migration process as quickly as you can. If you don't complete the later steps of migrating assets and deleting the original user record, your users may have two user records associated with the same login (see [login screenshot from Step 1](#page1)) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards).

Some tips for syncing your identity provider with New Relic and setting up access grants:

* If you're already using a New Relic app for either Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you're likely using an out-of-date version. The out-of-date app is titled "New Relic by account" while the newer, required app is titled "New Relic by organization."
* Once you complete those steps, new user records are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. After you complete provisioning users, confirm that you see those user records in the new [**User management** UI](#manage-users). Later, at step #6, you'll migrate your existing users' assets (dashboards, favorites, etc.) to the newly created user records.
* To access the new New Relic user management UI, you must be logged in via your new user record: this may require logging out, logging back in, and verifying your email to see all the logins associated with your email.
* When your identity provider is synced with New Relic and your users and groups are in New Relic, you must set up access grants. For some basics of how access grants work, see [Access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts). For a tutorial, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#group-access).
* Note that you won't be able to edit users or groups in New Relic: all user and group changes must be done from your identity provider.

When done, you can skip ahead to Step #5.

### Login methods [#login-methods]

If you chose **Manually** for [managing users](#managing-users), you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition.

You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors.

If you select SSO, you must complete [additional configuration steps](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#saml). Some tips for doing this:

* If you're already using a New Relic app for either Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you're likely using an out-of-date version. The out-of-date app is titled "New Relic by account" while the newer, required app is titled "New Relic by organization."
* To access the new New Relic user management UI, you'll have to ensure you're logged in via your new user record. This may require logging out, logging back in, and verifying your email to see all logins associated with that email.
* You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process.
* If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#auth-domain-definition).

## Step 5: Import existing users [#import-users]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-5.png"
  alt="User migration page 5"
  src={userMigrationPage5}
/>

There are two methods for adding and managing your New Relic users. Select the method you'll be using for instructions and tips:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="manual-provision"
    title="Add and manage users manually from New Relic UI"
  >
    **Recommended**: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. You can also use this list to help you figure out which users have access to which accounts, and also help you create groups and access grants during a later step.

    During this migration we provide a capability to upload users in bulk to make the task of adding users manually much easier. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. We recommend reviewing this list of users and removing any users you don't want migrated (for example, people who no longer work at your organization) from the list provided as well as the [New Relic UI for original user model.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#deleting)

    When you reupload your list of users and complete this step, it will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets.

    Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the remainder of the migration process as quickly as you can. If you don't complete the steps for migrating assets and deleting the original user record, your users may have two user records associated with the same login (see [login screenshot from Step 1](#page1)) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards).

    Some tips:

    * There's no need to reset passwords. If using username/password for your users' login, they'll have the same login credentials for the new user records created for them. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over.
    * Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets.

    **Recommended**: We recommend downloading the list of your existing original user model users. This can be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if needed. You can also use this list to help you figure out which users have access to which accounts, and also help you create groups and access grants during a later step.

    In a previous step (step #4), you should have completed [the steps for syncing your identity provider with New Relic](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign/#how-to) so that you can see the groups and users from your identity provider in New Relic. If you haven't already done that, do that now. Becasue your groups and users are synced between your identity provider and New Relic, you don't need to upload your users for this step.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Step 6: Access settings [#access-settings]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-6.png"
  alt="User migration page 6"
  src={userMigrationPage6}
/>

This step is about setting what roles and what accounts your user groups have access to. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. (If you've previously set up access grants as part of your SCIM setup in step #4, you can skip this step.)

You'll need to create an access grant for each account and role that you want a group to have access to. For some basics of how access grants work, see [Access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts). For a tutorial on how to create access grants, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#group-access).

## Step 7: Migrate user assets [#migrate-assets]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-7.png"
  alt="User migration page 7"
  src={userMigrationPage7}
/>

When this step is completed, the personal assets of your users are migrated to the new user records and the original user records are deleted. For users currently logged in to New Relic, once you complete this step, their current New Relic session won't be interrupted until they log out or until their current browser session expires.

User assets that are migrated include:

* Dashboards
* Favorites
* Weekly email settings
* Email opt in/out preferences
* User-specific [user keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key)
* New Relic One apps [NerdStorage data](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/nerdstorage)

If a user has access to several organizations that use New Relic (for example, if that user is a contractor), their original user model record won't be fully deleted until all those organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will have both an original user record and one or more new user records, and if that's the case, that is displayed upon login (see [the login screenshot in Page 1 section](#page1)).

## Step 8: Review and finish [#review-finish]

<img
  title="user-migration-page-8.png"
  alt="User migration page 8"
  src={userMigrationPage8}
/>

If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click **Finish Setup** when all users in the organization are migrated.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

Some common problems after migration:

* If you have admin-level roles assigned but get an error message when trying to access New Relic platform features, it may be because you've been assigned organization-scoped roles (**Organization manager** and/or **Authentication domain manager**) but not any account-scoped roles. To access New Relic features in a specific account, you'll need at least one account-scoped role (for example, **All product admin** or a custom role).
* If you've completed the migration, or are partway through the migration, and still see the original user management UI (the UI accessed through the **Account settings** tab), this may be because you are still logged in to your original user model record. Some remedies for this:
  * Log out of New Relic and log back in, selecting the **Verify email** option. When you've verified your email, choose the login option that says "Organization" and not the one that says "Original New Relic account."
  * If you're still having problems, clear your browser cache and attempt logging in again.

## After you're done [#manage-users]

Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), clicking **Administration**, and using these UI pages:

* **User management**: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests.
* **Organization and access**: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more).

For some tips for planning out access grants, see [Tips on access grants](#before-beginning).

For more about these tools and concepts, see the [user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users).
