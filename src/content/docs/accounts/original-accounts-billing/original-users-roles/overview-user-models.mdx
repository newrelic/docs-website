New Relic has two user models: an older user model referred to as our **original user model** and our newer user model, released in July of 2020.

## Determine your user model [#determine-user-model]

When you log in to New Relic, the user record associated with that login is on either one user model or the other. To determine what user model you're on: 

* Go to the bottom left and click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings).
* If you see an **Administration** tab, you are on our newer user model. If you see an **Account settings** tab, you're on our original user model. 

## Find the right docs [#docs]

The user model you're on affects how your users are managed ([read about the user model differences](#differences)). We have different sets of docs for the two user models:

* [Docs for our original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model)
* [Docs for our newer user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users)

Not sure which user model you're on? See [Determine user model](#determine-user-model).

## User management UI [#manage-users]

For how to use the user management UI:

* For users on our newer user model: see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where).
* For users on our original user model: from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Account settings**, and then click **Users and roles**. For information, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/).

## User model comparison [#differences]

When you log in to New Relic, the user record associated with your login is on either one user model or the other. Here's an explanation of the differences between the user models:

* **Newer user model** ([see docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users)): this newer, [improved](https://www.newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/user-management-and-access-security) user model was released in July 2020. It's the default user model for new New Relic sign ups. Here are the major differences from the original user model:
  * All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level [organization](/docs/new-relic-account-structure). This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with [multiple logins](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#account-access).
  * Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. [Learn about how user access works.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts)
* **Original user model** ([see docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/)): some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model:
  * There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login.
  * Users on the original user model have a different [user management system](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model).

To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our [blog post about user model changes](https://www.newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/user-management-and-access-security) and an [explanation of the new account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). For impacts and limitations, see [Feature impacts](#limitations).

## Requirements for our newer user model [#requirements]

Here are factors governing which organizations have users on the newer model:

* All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30, 2020 have users on this model (and also have the [newer pricing model](#pricing-plans)).
* Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the [user migration procedure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration).
* Some New Relic partners (for example, resellers, managed service providers) have had their users migrated to the new model. (If you're a New Relic organization with users on the original model and you require multi-tenancy, contact your account representative for more information.)

## Feature impacts of user model [#limitations]

The new user model offers [many benefits](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/user-management-and-access-security). Here are some feature impacts you might like to know about before deciding to switch:

* For classic alerting notifications (not new [notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications)): Users on the new model won't show up as an option when [choosing users to receive alert notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/#user). The result of this is that these users will not get [New Relic mobile app push notifications](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-mobile-apps/authentication-alerts/alerting-new-relic-mobile-apps). As a workaround, you can instead use their [email address](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/#email) as the notification channel.
* You can't use the REST API to [generate a list of users](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/account-examples-v2/listing-users-your-account/) (only original model users). Instead you'd use the [user management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where).

## Relation between user model and pricing model [#relation-to-pricing]

The user model isn't directly related to our two pricing models. For information about how these relate, see [Pricing model and user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models#pricing-user-table).
