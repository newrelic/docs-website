<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

New Relic products report a wide range of [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data). Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through [flexible event retention](#flex-retention).

## Overview of event data retention [#overview-event-retention]

All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of [data retention](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/data-retention-components#products) that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data). Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), our querying language.

There are [events reported from products by default](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/insights-default-data-other-new-relic-products), and there are [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data): each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level.

Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention:

* Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available.
* Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. [Custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) available for 1 day (and able to be extended with [Insight Pro](#insights-pro)).

To see your subscriptions, go to the [Account summary page](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/account-pricing-billing-options#summary-info).

## Insights Pro

<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for:

* Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products
* [Custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) that come from an agent API or from the [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api)

<Callout variant="important">
  Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI ([insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com)) to query your data: there are [other querying options](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#where) available.
</Callout>

To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: **[account dropdown](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention.**

With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use [flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/flexible-retention-define-how-long-new-relic-retains-event-data). This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="retention-calculation"
    title="How number of events stored is calculated"
  >
    This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with [flexible retention](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/flexible-retention-define-how-long-new-relic-retains-event-data), you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.)

    The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this:

    ```
    events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention)
    ```

    An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period.

    For example:

    * (200M transactions per week) \* (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights
    * (16M transactions per week) \* (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights

    For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window.

    For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected.

    For customers without an [Insights Pro subscription](#insights-pro), New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="usage-overage"
    title="Insights Pro event overage example"
  >
    In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan:

    * If you are using 975 million events, you **are not** over your retention.
    * If you are using 1.25 billion events, you **are** over your retention.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Owners or Admins**
    </Callout>

    The Insights **Data summary** UI page is used to see the types of [events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of `PageView` and `Transaction` events.

    To view **Data summary**:

    1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Manage data**.
    2. Select the **Summary** tab.

    Note: if you disable `PageView` or `Transaction` event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data.

    1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com/) > Manage data > Summary**.
    2. From the **Summary** tab, select **Configure data sources**.
    3. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save.

    Toggling `Transaction` on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves.

    For more about configuring event reporting, see [Event data retention](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention).

</CollapserGroup>

## Flexible data retention [#flex-retention]

With an [Insights Pro subscription](#insights-pro), you get access to **flexible retention**, which lets you define how some types of [event data](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention) are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention [through the UI](#ui-overview) or [through our GraphQL API](#api-examples).

Requirements to use this feature:

* An [Insights Pro subscription](https://newrelic.com/infrastructure/pricing) or equivalent trial.
* Applies only for [events governed by an Insights Pro subscription](#insights-pro).
* To use this feature, you must be an account [Owner](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles#roles) or data retention [add-on manager](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles#add-on) for your account.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="how-it-works"
    title="How it works"
  >
    To understand how standard event data retention works, first read [Event data retention](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention).

    With **flexible retention**, you specify the data retention for applicable [event namespaces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/insights-usage/insights-usage-event-queries#namespace) across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely.

    Your retention value can’t be lower than the [included retention](#glossary) or higher than the [default retention](#glossary).

    You can control data retention either in our [UI](#ui-overview) or by [API](#api-examples).

  <Collapser
    id="ui-overview"
    title="Manage retention via UI"
  >
    You can control data retention either using our [GraphQL API](#api-examples) or in the UI.

    To do this with the UI, go to **Account Settings > Usage > Data management section**. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating.

## Manage flexible retention via API [#api-examples]

You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in [the UI](#ui-overview).

The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating.

    To create a new rule, go to [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and run the following:

    ```
    mutation {
     dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, namespace: "APM", retentionInDays: 8) {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Delete an existing rule"
  >
    If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and run the following:

    ```
    mutation {
     dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, namespace: "APM") {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts"
  >
    You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and run the following:

    ```
    mutation {
      dataManagementCopyRetentions(
        sourceAccountId: <var>SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID</var>,
        destinationAccountIds: [<var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3</var>])
      {
        success
        failure
      }
    }
    ```

    Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.
