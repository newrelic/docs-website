  This document applies to our original [product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), which is no longer available for new accounts. For an explanation of pricing models, see [Overview of pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan).

Free trials for New Relic allow you to identify which products and subscription tier best fit your business. Accounts not [upgraded with a subscription](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/trial-lite-accounts#trial-upgrade) before the end of the trial period become Lite accounts, losing many key features and data.

## Trial accounts [#trial-intro]

When you start a free trial, you gain access to all the features of a Pro account including full access to support.

Our products allow you to view and track trends. Pro level [data retention](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components) allows you to track how changes in your business, such as marketing approaches or new technology, affect trends.

## Trial lengths [#length]

Trial lengths depend on the product:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Product
      </th>

      <th>

    </tr>

## End of trial period [#trial-end]

Once the trial ends, your account becomes a Lite account. Lite accounts can access all of our products except Infrastructure and Insights, but lose access to most product features and support.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Lite accounts retain only very recent data, which could cause the loss of valuable trend data. Avoid this by subscribing before your trial ends.
