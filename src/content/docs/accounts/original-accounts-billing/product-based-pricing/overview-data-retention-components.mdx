<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies for organizations on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. 

## Data retention UI [#find]

The best way to understand your data retention and see what options are available is to go to the UI. One reason this is recommended is because your organization may have edited your settings and they may no longer be the default settings documented here. 

The **Data retention** UI page is located in the [Data management hub](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data). Adjust retention values by clicking **Edit retention**. 

## Limits on editing and deleting data [#edit-limits]

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data) ends.

If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/).

## Product and API data retention policies [#products]

Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="apm"
    title="APM"
  >
    Specific retention policies apply to each <InlinePopover type="apm" /> subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes [metric timeslice data](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention#components-metric-data), [key metrics](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention#components-key-metrics), [trace data](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention#components-trace-data), and [event data](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/event-data-retention). In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the [aggregate metric data](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention-components#components-aggregate-metrics) description.

    ## APM data retention policies [#policies]

    For accounts on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level.

    In addition, infrastructure monitoring downsamples your data as it's ingested.

    ## Integration compute unit event limits [#event-limit]

    The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on **total** Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events.

    Additional details and clarifications about this limit:

    * This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same.
    * Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit.
    * If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="insights"
    title="Insights"
  >
For organizations on our original pricing model, a paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for:

* Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products
* [Custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) that come from an agent API or from the [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api)

To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui) and select **Insights usage**.

With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use [flexible retention to customize how long your event data is retained](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/flexible-retention-define-how-long-new-relic-retains-event-data). This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it.

(Note that with [flexible retention](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/flexible-retention-define-how-long-new-relic-retains-event-data), you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.)

    The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this:

    ```
    events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention)
    ```

    An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period.

    For example:

    * (200M transactions per week) \* (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights
    * (16M transactions per week) \* (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights

    For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window.

    For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected.

    For customers without an [Insights Pro subscription](#insights-pro), New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute.

    title="Insights Pro event overage example"
  >
    In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan:

    * If you are using 975 million events, you **are not** over your retention.
    * If you are using 1.25 billion events, you **are** over your retention.

    For organizations on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available.

    ### Logs-in-context data retention [#logs-in-context-retention]

    Our logs-in-context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see [APM data retention](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/apm-data-retention).

    For organizations on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), [Mobile](/docs/mobile-monitoring) data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes [data components](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/data-retention) such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data.

    For information about your subscription-related data usage, see [Mobile subscription usage](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/mobile-usage/mobile-subscription-usage-ui).

## Data components

For organizations on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the [data retention rules of specific products](#products):

    [Metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Note that metric timeslice data differs from other [metric data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics).
    </Callout>

    All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways.

    * **Fresh data** has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as [aggregate metrics](#components-aggregate-metrics).
    * As **data ages** and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep [key metrics](#components-key-metrics).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="components-aggregate-metrics"
    title="Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile"
  >
    Aggregate [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your [subscription level](http://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing).

    We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is [aggregated into larger segments](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/extracting-metric-data#time-data-granularity).
