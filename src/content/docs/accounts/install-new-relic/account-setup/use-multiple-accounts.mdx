A New Relic organization (set of related accounts under same billing) can have only one subscription level: you cannot mix subscription levels within an organization. However, you can create multiple accounts with different subscription levels.

## Create multiple accounts

<Callout variant="important">
  For organizations on the [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan#pricing-plans), only the Pro and Enterprise [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows multiple accounts with [master/sub-account structures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts).
</Callout>

When creating multiple New Relic accounts, we recommend you use the same [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) for applications on the same host. This enables New Relic to link together those applications.

To create additional accounts with the same email address:

1. Use the same email address and [password](/docs/subscriptions/account-user-settings#requirements) to [sign up](http://newrelic.com/signup) for one or more accounts.
2. [Create an account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account) for each subscription level you want to use.
3. Configure your mission-critical hosts to use the master account's [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key).
4. Use license keys from your inexpensive or free accounts for your remaining hosts.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note for Ruby: you can configure the Ruby APM agent to apply different keys to different application environments. In the newrelic.yml file, edit the **Application environment** sections. For example, set the production `license_key` property to use the paid subscription key, and use a different key for any dev, test, or staging environments.
