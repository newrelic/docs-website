[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) (GAE) helps you build web and mobile apps on an open cloud platform, using the languages, frameworks, [custom runtimes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/), Docker images, and third-party libraries that you choose. The App Engine environment automatically scales your app while balancing your resources' CPU and memory.

You can use New Relic to monitor applications that reside in a Google App Engine flexible environment through the [APM agents](#gae-agent), and you can view data about your Google App Engine services through the [Google App Engine integration](#gae-integration) for our infrastructure monitoring.

## APM agent installation for GAE Flexible [#gae-agent]

As a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) partner](https://newrelic.com/partner/gcp), New Relic supports the [Google App Engine flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/) so that you can deploy to a Docker image with a custom runtime.

Some agents allow you to deploy to a standard Docker image using [GAE flexible installation with "native" support](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/). With "native" support, you provide your app code and an `app.yaml` and Google App Engine deploys to a prebuilt Docker image. This configuration does have some limitations.

To monitor your applications that reside in a Google App Engine flexible environment, follow the installation instructions for the <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent that you use:

## Infrastructure integration for Google App Engine [#gae-integration]

Our [infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure) offers an [integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) that reports data about your Google App Engine services. With the [Google App Engine integration](/docs/gcp-gcp_appengine-integration), you can view <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alerts, query metric data, and explore inventory data.
