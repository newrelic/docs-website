Rackspace offers a plugin for the [Cloud Load Balancer](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/ "Link opens in a new window") product. The plugin allows you to see HTTP vs. HTTPS traffic, easily set <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to your predefined thresholds, and periodically check the health of the nodes associated with your load balancer to ensure they are responding correctly.

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

Make sure your system has these components installed:

* <DNT>Ruby</DNT> (version 1.8.7 or higher)
* <DNT>Rubygems</DNT> (version 1.3.7 or higher)
* <DNT>Ruby</DNT> bundler gem
* A [New Relic account](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window")
* Rackspace Load Balancer with logging enabled

## Installing the plugin [#install]

If you have load balancers in multiple regions, configure a separate plugin for each region. Always use lower case characters for the region's name in your yml file. For more information about YAML parsing, see [http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/ "Link opens in a new window").

```
wget https://github.com/newrelic-platform/newrelic_rackspace_load_balancers_plugin/archive/1.0.0.zip
```

```
bundle install -binstubs
  ./bin/newrelic_rs --sample-config
```

1. Download the zip file from GitHub:
2. Extract the contents into the directory you want to use.
3. Run the following commands from within this directory to get the gem setup:
4. Modify the <DNT>**config/newrelic_plugin.yml**</DNT> with your New Relic [license key](/docs/subscriptions/license-key), Rackspace username and API key, and the region where your load balancer sits. Be sure to use lower case characters for the region name.
5. Start the agent: `./bin/newrelic_rs`.
6. Verify that the output says `gathering xx statistics`.

## Viewing the Load Balancer [#view]

2. From the New Relic UI, select the Rackspace Cloud Load Balancer icon.

From here you can select load balancer(s), view traffic, configure alerts, and more.
