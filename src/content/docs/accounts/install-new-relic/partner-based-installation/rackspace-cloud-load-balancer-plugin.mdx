Rackspace offers a plugin for the [Cloud Load Balancer](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/ "Link opens in a new window") product. The plugin allows you to see HTTP vs. HTTPS traffic, easily set alerts to your predefined thresholds, and periodically check the health of the nodes associated with your load balancer to ensure they are responding correctly.

## Contents [#qiklinks]

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

Make sure your system has these components installed:

* Ruby (version 1.8.7 or higher)
* Rubygems (version 1.3.7 or higher)
* Ruby bundler gem
* A [New Relic account](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window")
* Rackspace Load Balancer with logging enabled

## Installing the plugin [#install]

If you have load balancers in multiple regions, configure a separate plugin for each region. Always use lower case characters for the region's name in your yml file. For more information about YAML parsing, see [http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/ "Link opens in a new window").

```
wget https://github.com/newrelic-platform/newrelic_rackspace_load_balancers_plugin/archive/1.0.0.zip
```

```
bundle install -binstubs
  ./bin/newrelic_rs --sample-config
```

1. Download the zip file from GitHub:
2. Extract the contents into the directory you want to use.
3. Run the following commands from within this directory to get the gem setup:
4. Modify the **config/newrelic_plugin.yml** with your New Relic [license key](/docs/subscriptions/license-key), Rackspace username and API key, and the region where your load balancer sits. Be sure to use lower case characters for the region name.
5. Start the agent: `./bin/newrelic_rs`.
6. Verify that the output says `gathering xx statistics`.
