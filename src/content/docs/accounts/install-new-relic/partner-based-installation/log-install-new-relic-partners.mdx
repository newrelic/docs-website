If you signed up for New Relic through one of New Relic's partners, you may need to follow additional single sign on (SSO) procedures to log in to start using New Relic. There also may be special steps needed to complete the deployment process. This document provides basic login procedures for accounts created through New Relic partners, with links to additional resources as applicable.

## Create a New Relic account (all partners) [#partner-account]

If you have received a special offer from a New Relic partner, follow the partner's link directly to create a New Relic account.

## Sign into and deploy New Relic (most partners) [#partner-users]

You will receive an email confirmation message with a link to confirm your account, sign into New Relic, and complete the deployment process.

## Sign into and deploy New Relic (special partners) [#partner-users]

These partners require specific login and deployment procedures for you to use your New Relic account.

      To create an account through [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) and sign into New Relic, you must install and run the W3 PHP agent, not just get an API key.
    </Callout>

    Deploying the agent requires <DNT>**administrative access**</DNT>, including:

    * SSH/command line access
    * Root or sudo access to run the New Relic installer and restart your web server

      If you are running an economy, shared hosting, or blogger package, or if you are not sure what are your account permissions, contact your hosting provider. For example, if your WordPress site is on shared servers, you may not be able to install New Relic. Your provider should be able to give you information about your account permissions, or upgrade your account if necessary.

      To install the New Relic plugin for W3 Edge/Wordpress users:

    1. Log in to your WordPress account at [wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php](https://wordpress.org/support/bb-login.php).
    2. Follow [New Relic's instructions](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/wordpress-users-new-relic) to complete the installation process, or contact [W3TC support](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/w3-total-cache) for assistance.
    3. Wait for New Relic to begin collecting data.

       Within a few minutes after deploying the agent, performance data about your app will appear on APM's [Applications Overview p](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/applications-overview-dashboard)age.

       <Callout variant="tip">
