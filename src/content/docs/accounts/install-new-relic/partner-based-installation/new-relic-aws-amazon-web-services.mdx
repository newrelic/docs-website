[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com/ "Link opens in a new window") delivers a set of services that form a reliable, scalable, and inexpensive computing platform solution. New Relic helps AWS users improve the performance and end-user experience of their business-critical applications.

New Relic works with the following AWS systems:

* [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
* [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)
* [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
* [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [AWS OpsWorks](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks)

## AWS and New Relic [#aws-nr]

New Relic helps you understand how your applications and cloud services work together, and allows you to quickly resolve issues when they don't. By using AWS and New Relic, you gain increased visibility of your application performance, improved resolution speed, and an enhanced migration process:

      <td>
        By using AWS and New Relic together, you eliminate blind spots in the depths of your systems, and gain full visibility of your application's performance. Gain insight with features like [service maps](/docs/data-analysis/service-maps/get-started/service-maps-visualize-monitor-apps-entire-architecture) and [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces).

        With SaaS-to-SaaS monitoring, you can quickly identify application issues and resolve them. To increase your resolution speed, use [labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/organize-your-data/labels-categories-organize-apps-servers-monitors) to efficiently organize your entities, and setup [alert thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) to get notified as soon as something goes wrong.

        Monitoring cloud services and datacenters together allows for easier migration between services. To determine which applications to migrate, understand your performance metrics with features like [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction), and [SLA reports](/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports).

## Requirements

Before you install New Relic, make sure you have a supported [Amazon Web Services account](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/ "Link opens in a new window"). In addition, for any New Relic installation, you will need your New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window") for your account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To view your license key: From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) in the New Relic UI at [rpm.newrelic.com](http://rpm.newrelic.com), select **Account settings**.
