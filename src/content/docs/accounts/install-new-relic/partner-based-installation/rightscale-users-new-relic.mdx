[RightScale](https://www.rightscale.com/) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications. Supported languages for both [New Relic](http://support.rightscale.com/27-Partners/New_Relic) and RightScale include Java, Ruby, .NET, PHP, and Python.

In order to use New Relic through the [RightScale partnership](http://www.rightscale.com/partners/isv/new-relic.php), you need a New Relic account. Before getting started, be sure to [enable API access](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started).

## Add New Relic RightScripts [#add-rpm]

Before you can view data from New Relic in RightScale, add the appropriate New Relic RightScript to your ServerTemplates:

1. From RightCloud, select **Design > MultiCloud Marketplace > ServerTemplates**.
2. Import the [New Relic Performance Monitoring Toolbox](http://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/New-Relic-Performance-Monitori/lineage/17048 "Link opens in a new window") ServerTemplate into your **Local** view.

After you import the ServerTemplate, you can use the associated New Relic RightScripts with your account and add them to your ServerTemplates as appropriate for your agent language.

With the 3.5 framework, New Relic instruments applications targeting .NET frameworks 2.0 or higher running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Azure.

## Example PHP RightScript installation [#php-example]

Here is an example of adding the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScripts to a PHP application server.

<img
  title="screen run script.png"
  alt="screen run script.png"
  src={accountsRightscaleRunScript}
/>

<figcaption>
  Add the **APP New Relic RPM for PHP** RightScript as a **boot script** to the ServerTemplate that is being used to run your PHP application servers. This will automatically deploy the New Relic agent when a new server is launched with that ServerTemplate.
</figcaption>

If your PHP application is already running on a server, you can add it as an **operational script** under the **Scripts** tab, and run the action on the running server.

Be sure to define the following input value for the new script:

```
NR_License_Key: Enter your New Relic license key.
```

You can either manually enter the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> or create a credential for it.

## View APM monitoring data [#view]

When viewing the data that New Relic monitors, you will only see the names of the applications that are on servers where you have run the New Relic RightScript. A **host** is a server and an **instance** is an instance of an application.

  title="screen nr rightscale applist.png"
  alt="screen nr rightscale applist.png"
  src={accountsRightscaleAppList}
/>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

To view your New Relic data:

1. Go to **Reports > New Relic**.
2. From the list of application(s) in your New Relic RightScript deployment, select an application name.
3. On your first login, be sure to [change your password](/docs/subscriptions/changing-passwords-and-user-preferences): From the ([user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) in the New Relic UI, select **User preferences**.
4. Use the New Relic menu options to view different performance data and charts.
