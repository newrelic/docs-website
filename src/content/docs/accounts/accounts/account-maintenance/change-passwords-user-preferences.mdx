This document contains information on New Relic password requirements.

## Change your password

New Relic account passwords don't expire. However, users can or change their own password and other personal account information anytime.

Your ability to change your password from the UI may depend on your user and organization level settings. To change your password from the UI: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com,), click the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) and select **User preferences**. When creating a password, adhere to the password requirements below.

Your password must meet these minimum requirements:

* 8 to 50 characters in length
* At least one letter (a-z, A-Z)
* At least one number (0-9), special character, or space

Special characters allowed include `~` `` ` `` `!` `@` `#` `$` `%` `^` `&` `*` `(` `)` `_` `-` `+` `=` `{` `[` `}` `]` `:` `;` `"` `'` `<` `,` `>` `.` `?` `/` `|` `\`. Spaces are also allowed.

  In addition to New Relic's requirements, follow your organization's guidelines for password length, use of upper or lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Reset password

If you forgot your own password or need to request a password reset, you can use New Relic's [self-service options](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/troubleshoot-password-email-address-login-problems#forgot-password). Admins can't reset passwords for other users. If you need to reset someone else's password, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com), or send an email to `account_recovery@newrelic.com`.
