This document contains information on New Relic password requirements.

## Change your password [#password]

New Relic account passwords don't expire. However, users can change their own password and other personal account information anytime.

Your ability to change your password from the UI may depend on your user and organization level settings. To change your password from the UI: From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>, click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and select <DNT>**User preferences**</DNT>.

Your password must meet these minimum requirements:

* 8 to 50 characters in length
* At least one letter (a-z, A-Z)
* At least one number (0-9), special character, or space

Special characters allowed include `~` `` ` `` `!` `@` `#` `$` `%` `^` `&` `*` `(` `)` `_` `-` `+` `=` `{` `[` `}` `]` `:` `;` `"` `'` `<` `,` `>` `.` `?` `/` `|` `\`. Spaces ` ` are also allowed.

<Callout variant="important">
  In addition to our requirements, follow your organization's guidelines for password length, use of upper or lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Reset password [#reset]

If you forgot your own password or need to request a password reset, you can use our [self-service options](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/troubleshoot-password-email-address-login-problems#forgot-password). Admins can't reset passwords for other users. If you need to reset someone else's password, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Manage passwords for your users [#manage-passwords-other-users]

Admins can't reset or change passwords for other users, but you can delete users if you want to ensure an old password is no longer in use. You can delete users [one at a time](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#deleting) from the UI, or via [bulk user management](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#bulk), or via the [API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users/#delete-users).
