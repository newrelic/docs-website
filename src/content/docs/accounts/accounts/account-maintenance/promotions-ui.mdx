Promotions are special offers to try out New Relic product features. You can browse through our various promotions and manage your enrollment in the UI at **Previews & trials**. 

The type of promotion currently available is the product preview. This is the opportunity to try out a feature before it is released. Here's what what you get in the UI:

* One-stop shopping for previews: View all available product previews in one place.
* Enrollment flexibility: Easily sign-up or leave from product previews until they become generally available (GA).
* Upgrade options: Upgrade to access products once they're GA.

Before you get started, see the sections below to see if you're eligible. 

## Eligibility [#eligibility]

You can go to **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Administration > Usage Summary > Previews & trials** to see if your organization is eligible for a product promotion. If you don't see this page, your organization isn't eligible.

All promotions apply to the entire organization, including all users and all accounts that belong to your organization.

### Eligible users [#users]

For some product promotions, any user in an organization can enroll. For other product promotions, a limited set of users may have the ability to do the following:

* Enroll in a promotion
* Leave a promotion
* Re-enroll after leaving a promotion

### Eligible organizations [#org-rules]

Organizations can be enrolled in more than one promotion at a time. An organization is eligible (or not eligible) for a promotion based on a variety of factors. If you receive an error message when you attempt to opt into a promotion, you may need to take additional steps to enroll your organization in that promotion or your organization may not be eligible.

## Manage your enrollment [#access-ui]

The **Previews & trials** page lists available product promotions in a single, consolidated table view. Each row in the table contains essential information such as the product name, a brief description, status (**Available**, **Opted In**, **Opted Out**), and the anticipated end date of the preview. 

<Callout variant="important">
  Some promotions don't have a defined end date, so you may see the end date as **Ongoing**. We try to provide a best estimate of the length of the preview, but it is provided for informational purposes only. The end date should not be construed as an offer, commitment, promise or obligation on behalf of New Relic to deliver any product, material, code, functionality, or other feature.

        src={accountsPreviewsandTrials}
    />
4. Open the ellipsis menu (**...**) for the promotion you're interested in, and then select one of the following:
    * **Enroll**

        src={accountsPromotionsTable}
    />

When you're finished, a confirmation message will appear. 

## Upgrade after preview feature is released [#upgrade-at-ga]

Within a few days of a product preview becoming GA, you'll receive an in-product notification. You'll need to decide whether you would like to have access to the feature after it's GA.

1. On the notification, click **Manage preview**.
