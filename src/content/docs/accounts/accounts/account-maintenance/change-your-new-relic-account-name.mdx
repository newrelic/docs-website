## Change user name [#user-name]

To change your user name:
1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User preferences**.
2. On the right side, click **Full name**.

Note that if a user is managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), they can't change their name from the UI.  

## Change account name [#account-name]

A New Relic organization can have one or more accounts. How to change the name of an account differs depending on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models) you're on: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="new-relic-one-user-model"
    title="New Relic One user model"
  >
  To add and rename accounts, use [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph). 

  </Collapser>


  <Collapser
    id="original-user-model"
    title="Original user model"
  >
