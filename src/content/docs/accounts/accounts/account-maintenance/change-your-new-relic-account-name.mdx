## Change user name [#user-name]

To change your user name:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select <DNT>**User preferences**</DNT>.
2. On the right side, click <DNT>**Full name**</DNT>.

Note that if a user is managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), they can't change their name from the UI.

## Change account name [#account-name]

For details about account structure, see [Organization and account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

To add and rename accounts from the UI:

1. From the [Access management UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail), click <DNT>**Accounts**</DNT>.
2. For the account you want to rename, click <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> and then click <DNT>**Edit account**</DNT>.

For how to use the API for this, see [our NerdGraph docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph).

Account names are differentiated by [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id), not by name. For this reason, an organization can have multiple accounts with the same name.

If you can't change an account name, it may be because:

* You don't have proper [permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings)
* You're on our original user model: in that case you'd use the <DNT>**Account settings**</DNT> UI, available from the user menu
* You have a partnership account structure: in that case, use [the Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object)
