In your New Relic account settings, you can subscribe and unsubscribe to specific types of emails, and edit other email preferences.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For alert-related emails, see [Alert notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications).
</Callout>

## Add New Relic to your email allow list [#email-allowlist]

To ensure you get New Relic emails, you can add the following to your organization's allow list of trusted email sources: `noreply@newrelic.com` and `*@mailer-d.newrelic.com`. This helps to:

* Prevent New Relic emails from being trapped in your spam filters.
* Prevent your email from being added to suppression lists.

## Change your email address [#change-email]

To change your email address: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**User preferences**</DNT>, and click <DNT>**Email**</DNT>.

New Relic user email addresses have to the following restrictions:

* Characters: Must be composed of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and special characters including periods (.), dashes (-), underscores (\_), and plus signs (+).
* Length: Limited to a maximum of 255 characters.

<Callout variant="tip">
  SSO/SAML users:

  You can't update your email address while authenticated into a SSO/SAML account. You'll only be able to change your email address while logged into a non-SAML account.

  Your email address is used to authenticate you into New Relic. Until your identity provider is updated to match your new email address, you won't be able to log in to New Relic.
</Callout>

## Unsubscribe from emails [#emails]

New Relic sends two types of emails:

* Marketing emails: those related to new features, special offers, etc.
* Product emails: those related to product information, like performance reports, alerts, billing, etc.

Details on unsubscribing from these email types are below.

### Unsubscribe from marketing emails [#marketing-emails]

New Relic marketing emails include an <DNT>**Unsubscribe**</DNT> link. The link directs you to a page where you can control your subscription to different types of messages.

### Unsubscribe from product-related emails [#product-emails]

There are a few different product-related emails, with different ways to control them:

* Alerts: For how to control <InlinePopover type="alerts"/>-related emails, see [Alert notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications).
* <InlinePopover type="apm"/> weekly report emails: See [APM performance reports](/docs/apm/reports/other-performance-analysis/weekly-performance-report#opting_out).
