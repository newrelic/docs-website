## Add New Relic to your email allow list

To ensure you get New Relic emails, you can add the following to your organization's allow list of trusted email sources: `noreply@newrelic.com` and `*@mailer-d.newrelic.com`. This helps to:

* Prevent New Relic emails from being trapped in your spam filters.
* Prevent your email from being added to suppression lists.

## Set New Relic email preferences

Some users can update emails settings related to New Relic announcements, offers, and performance summaries. To do this: go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **User preferences**.

## Change your email address

Some users can update their email address and other user preferences.

To change your email address and some other user preferences: go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **User preferences**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  **SSO/SAML users:**

  You can't update your email address while authenticated into a SSO/SAML account. You will only be able to change your email address while logged into a non-SAML account.

  Your email address is used to authenticate you into New Relic. Until your identity provider is updated to match your new email address, you won't be able to log in to New Relic.

## Unsubscribe from New Relic emails

New Relic sends two types of emails to the [email address associated with your New Relic account](/docs/subscriptions/account-email-settings):

* Marketing emails related to new features, special offers, etc.
* Product emails related to alerts, updates, billing, etc.

If you have multiple accounts, you must opt in or out of these emails separately for each account.

### Unsubscribe from marketing emails

Marketing emails from New Relic include an **unsubscribe** link. The link directs you to a page where you can confirm the email address and stop these types of messages. Note that there are [other product emails](#unsubscribe) besides marketing emails.

### Unsubscribe from product-related emails

For information on unsubscribing from product-related emails, see [Email preferences](#emails).

For alert-related emails, see [Alert notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/view-or-update-user-email-channels).
