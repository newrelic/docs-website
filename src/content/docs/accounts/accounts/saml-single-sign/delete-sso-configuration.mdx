  These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate). For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso).

  If you delete your SAML SSO integration with New Relic, you cannot restore it. However, you can follow standard procedures to set up your configuration again.

For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), here's how to delete your SAML SSO configuration completely:

1. Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL.
2. From the New Relic menu bar, select: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**.
3. Select **Delete SAML Configuration**.
4. At the confirmation prompt, select **OK**.
