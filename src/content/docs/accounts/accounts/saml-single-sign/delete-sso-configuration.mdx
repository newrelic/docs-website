  If you delete your SAML SSO integration with New Relic, you cannot restore it. However, you can follow standard procedures to set up your configuration again.
</Callout>

To delete your SAML Single Sign On configuration completely:

1. Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL.
2. From the New Relic menu bar, select: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**.
3. Select **Delete SAML Configuration**.
4. At the confirmation prompt, select **OK**.
