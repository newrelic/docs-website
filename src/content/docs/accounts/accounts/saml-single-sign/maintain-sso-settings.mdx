After your SAML SSO login is configured, tested, and enabled, all of your New Relic account users (including the account Owner and Admins) must use your organization's SSO URL to sign in to New Relic. Their email address must match what has been set up in New Relic. Also, their ability to use the SSO URL to access applications other than New Relic will depend on their permissions set in those applications.

## Email addresses

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Owner or Admins**
</Callout>

Account Owners or Admins must ensure that users' email addresses to sign in to New Relic match their SSO email. Account Owners, Admins and users cannot update email addresses on SAML authenticated accounts.

To update user information for your organization's New Relic account:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
2. From the **Users** list, select any of the options to add new users, edit existing users' roles, or delete them.

## Troubleshoot SSO login

No one using the account, including the Owner and Admins, can sign in to New Relic directly. If you get locked out of SSO and need to disable it or change the configuration, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
