<Callout title="Original pricing plan">
This doc is for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).
</Callout>

## Overview

For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim). These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate).

Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a [SAML](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#saml) certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used.

## Requirements

Requirements include:

* These docs apply for managing users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate). For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso).
* Access to this feature requires Pro or Enterprise edition. 
* Owner role required

## SSO settings UI page [#ui]

To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Account settings**, then click **Security and authentication**, then click **Single sign on**.

If you don't see this UI, review [the requirements](#requirements). 


## Providers supported by New Relic [#saml_providers]

For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select **([account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on**.

Providers include:

* [Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831502.aspx "Link opens in a new window")
* [Auth0](http://developers.auth0.com/newrelic "Link opens in a new window")
* [Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/new-relic-tutorial "Link opens in a new window")
* [Okta](http://www.okta.com/newrelic "Link opens in a new window")
* [OneLogin](http://www.onelogin.com/partners/app-partners/new-relic/ "Link opens in a new window")
* [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html)
* [Salesforce](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Configuring-SAML-SSO-to-NewRelic "Link opens in a new window")
* Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0

## SAML information in New Relic account [#account-SML-information]

To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic [SSO settings UI page](#ui):

* Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message
* SAML version: 2.0
* Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize`)
* Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST
* NameID format: Email address
* Attributes: None required
* Entity ID: Account URL (default of `rpm.newrelic.com`)

## New Relic SAML requirements [#requirements]

For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems.
