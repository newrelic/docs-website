For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).

These docs are for setting up SAML SSO for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).

Single sign-on (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you're a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a [SAML](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#saml) certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include:

* These docs apply for managing users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models). For enabling SSO for users on our newer user model, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso).
* Requires Pro or Enterprise edition.
* You must have the [Owner role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#roles).

## SSO settings UI page [#ui]

To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Account settings**, then click **Security and authentication**, then click **Single sign-on**.

If you don't see this UI, review the [requirements](#requirements).

For how to optimally set up SAML SSO, see the instructions and tips below. 

## Providers supported by New Relic [#saml_providers]

Users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models) can find a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're on our [newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): in that case, you'll use [a different method to set up SAML SSO](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).

SAML service providers that we support for users on our original user model include:

* [Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831502.aspx)
* [Auth0](http://developers.auth0.com/newrelic)
* [Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/new-relic-tutorial)
* [Google](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6363863)
* [Okta](http://www.okta.com/newrelic)
* [OneLogin](http://www.onelogin.com/partners/app-partners/new-relic)
* [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html)
* [Salesforce](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Configuring-SAML-SSO-to-NewRelic)
* Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0

## SAML information in New Relic account [#account-SML-information]

To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic [SSO settings UI page](#ui):

* Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message
* SAML version: 2.0
* Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize`)
* Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST
* NameID format: Email address
* Attributes: None required
* Entity ID: Account URL (default of `rpm.newrelic.com`)

## New Relic SAML implementation [#requirements]

For SAML providers and service providers (like New Relic) to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO. This will be useful if you're verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you're troubleshooting implementation problems.

## SAML SSO features and procedures [#more-procedures]

Here are some important procedures for managing SAML SSO for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models):

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="domain-allow-list"
    title="Recommended: Claim your domain to bypass SAML SSO process"
  >
    If your organization is on Pro or Enterprise edition, you can request to have your domain name(s) placed on our allow list, which will streamline the SAML SSO enablement process. When your users' email address has a domain that matches the domain you've claimed, New Relic automatically adds them as **Active** users and retains their current user type.

    Benefits of claiming your domain include:

    * Makes it easier for your admins because they won't have to adjust your users' user type.
    * Makes it easier for your users to get started using New Relic because they don't need to confirm their user record via email.
    * Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization.

      To claim your domain, [contact support](https://support.newrelic.com).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="set-up-saml"
    title="Set up SAML SSO"
  >
    After obtaining your [SAML identity provider certificate](/docs/subscriptions/saml-service-providers), which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the single sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a [customer partnership](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions#partnerships), access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level.
    </Callout>

    ### Requirements

    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    ### Parent and child accounts [#parent]

    If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the [custom entity ID feature](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/configure-saml-multiple-accounts).

    ### Configure SSO [#configuring]

    To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes.

    To set up your SSO configuration for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models):

    1. Optional but recommended: read about [claiming your domain to streamline the SAML SSO process](#domain-allow-list).
    2. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**.
    3. From the **SAML single sign-on** page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details.
    4. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select **Choose file**, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file.
    5. Specify the **Remote login URL** that your users will use for single sign-on.
    6. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the **Logout landing URL**; otherwise leave blank.
    7. Save your changes.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default.
       </Callout>

       ### Test SSO [#testing]

       After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the **Test** page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results.

       To go back and change your configuration settings, select **1 CONFIGURE**.

       ### Enable SSO [#enabling]

       When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy single sign-on with New Relic. Unless you've [claimed your domain with New Relic](#domain-allow-list), your users cannot sign in until they [complete the email confirmation](/docs/subscriptions/adding-users-to-saml-accounts) that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic.

       <Callout variant="caution">
         If you [disable SAML SSO](/docs/subscriptions/maintaining-sso-settings), New Relic automatically flags all of your **Pending** users as **Active**. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as **Pending**, and they will need to confirm their account access by email.
       </Callout>

       ### Add a logout URL for session timeouts [#timeout_url]

       New Relic's **Session configuration** feature requires a [logout URL](/docs/subscriptions/setting-session-timeouts#saml_session) for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from **Session configuration** to go directly to SAML single sign-on and add a logout URL.

       <Callout variant="important">
         The logout URL **cannot** contain `newrelic.com` anywhere in the URL.
       </Callout>

       The **Session configuration** feature also includes the option to select an [automatic timeout](/docs/subscriptions/setting-session-timeouts#saml_reauthentication) for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-users-saml"
    title="Add users to SAML accounts"
  >
    For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).

    Unless you've [claimed your domain with New Relic](#domain-allow-list) (recommended), your users are not added in New Relic until they complete the email confirmation that is sent automatically upon SAML SSO enablement. This is an additional security measure. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications (such as alert notifications).

    For organizations **without** SAML SSO enabled, the Owner or Admin can add new users without requiring email confirmation.

    ### Requirements

    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    ### Add and confirm users [#adding]

    Follow this process to add and confirm users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) that are authenticating via SAML SSO:

    1. The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
    2. Unless you've [claimed your domain](#domain-allow-list), your users are marked as **Pending** and are sent an email confirmation. (Pending users won't receive New Relic product notifications, such as alert notifications.)
    3. Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL.
    4. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as **Active**.

       <Callout variant="caution">
         If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your **Pending** users as **Active**. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as **Pending**, and they'll need to confirm their account access by email.
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="saml-multiple-accounts"
    title="SAML for multiple accounts"
  >
    In the SAML protocol, the **entity ID** uniquely identifies the service provider (New Relic) to your SAML provider. New Relic's default entity ID is `rpm.newrelic.com`. This is sufficient if you have only a single SAML-enabled account.

    When you configure multiple New Relic accounts with SAML, your SAML provider typically requires each account to have a unique entity ID. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities, use New Relic's custom entity ID feature.

    ### Requirements

    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    ### Select custom entity IDs [#custom]

    New Relic's custom entity ID feature allows you to enable a unique entity ID for each of your accounts. You can then configure SAML SSO for them as a distinct application with your SAML provider. This allows you to centrally control user authentication to each of your accounts independently.

    To select custom entity IDs:

    1. Follow [standard procedures](/docs/subscriptions/setting-up-sso) to set up SSO.
    2. In addition, from the **Entity ID** row on the **Step 1. Configure** page, select **Use custom entity ID**.

       <Callout variant="important">
         You must use the same entity ID to configure the application's setting with your SAML provider. Some SAML providers require you to create a new application configuration when changing the entity ID.
       </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="maintain-saml"
    title="Maintain SSO settings"
  >
    After your SAML SSO login is configured, tested, and enabled, all of your New Relic account users (including the account Owner and Admins) must use your organization's SSO URL to sign in to New Relic. Their email address must match what has been set up in New Relic. Also, their ability to use the SSO URL to access applications other than New Relic will depend on their permissions set in those applications.

    ### Requirements

    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    ### Update SAML SSO info [#sso_procedures]

    To update SAML SSO information for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models):

    1. Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL.

    2. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**.

    3. To temporarily turn off the SAML integration with New Relic and update your settings, select **Disable SAML login**.

    4. Optional: To change your existing SAML certificate, select **Choose file**. Follow standard procedures to select and save the file, then save.

    5. Optional: To change your existing SSO URLs, copy and paste in (or type) the **Remote login URL** or **Logout landing URL**, then save.

       ### Email addresses [#user_email]

       <Callout variant="tip">
         **Owner or Admins**
       </Callout>

       Account Owners or Admins must ensure that users' email addresses to sign in to New Relic match their SSO email. Account Owners, Admins and users cannot update email addresses on SAML authenticated accounts.

       To update user information for your organization's New Relic account:

    6. Go to: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.

    7. From the **Users** list, select any of the options to add new users, edit existing users' roles, or delete them.

       ### Troubleshoot SSO login [#troubleshoot]

       No one using the account, including the Owner and Admins, can sign in to New Relic directly. If you get locked out of SSO and need to disable it or change the configuration, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-sso"
    title="Delete SSO configuration"
  >
    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    <Callout variant="caution">
      If you delete your SAML SSO integration with New Relic, you cannot restore it. However, you can follow standard procedures to set up your configuration again.
    </Callout>

    For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), here's how to delete your SAML SSO configuration completely:

    1. Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL.
    2. From the New Relic menu bar, select: **[user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on**.
    3. Select **Delete SAML Configuration**.
    4. At the confirmation prompt, select **OK**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="partners-saml"
    title="Partners and SAML SSO"
  >
    With [partnership accounts](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions), authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. For accounts where the partnership supports SSO, users may access their New Relic UI without reauthenticating. These Partner accounts could use SAML SSO as an alternative secure method to sign in to the New Relic site.

    Other Partner accounts, including Heroku, AppDirect, and Microsoft Azure, do not permit direct login to New Relic. In this situation, SAML integration from the partner's site is not supported by the partner SSO. If you have questions, contact your partner representative at New Relic.

    ### Requirements

    For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](#requirements).

    ### Example [#example-parent]

    Your account structure and settings affect whether SAML is available and how it applies to your accounts.

    <img
      title="screen saml hierarchy.png"
      alt="screen saml hierarchy.png"
      src={accountsNRParentChildAccountStructure}
    />

    <figcaption>
      This example shows the hierarchy for New Relic Partner accounts with parent accounts and child accounts.
    </figcaption>

    Here is an example of how accounts and child accounts inherit the SAML SSO configuration.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Account level**
          </th>

          <th>
            **SAML SSO configuration**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Partnership
          </td>

          <td>
            The partnership level allows you to control whether accounts under the partnership can have SAML enabled. The partnership account's Owner has certain administrative functions, but a SAML configuration on this account is not inherited by other accounts in the partnership.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Parent accounts
          </td>

          <td>
            Parent accounts (also referred to as master accounts) have a direct, hierarchical relationship to one or more [child accounts](/docs/subscriptions/creating-sub-accounts). Typically the SAML configuration on a parent account is inherited automatically by all of its child accounts.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Child accounts
          </td>

          <td>
            Child accounts (also known as sub-accounts) inherit their SAML SSO configuration from their parent account when the parent account has SAML configured. If the parent account does not have SAML configured, each child account may have its own configuration. For more information, see [Configuring SAML with multiple accounts](/docs/subscriptions/configuring-saml-with-multiple-accounts).
