For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), this doc explains how to add users to accounts and update their roles. You must be an Owner or an Admin for your New Relic account to add, change, and delete user [roles and permissions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#account-rights).

Topics include:

* [View accounts users](#viewing)
* [View pending SAML-SSO users](#pending-sso)
* [Add new user](#adding_users)
* [Update account roles](#updating)
* [Delete a user](#deleting)
* [Update account owner](#owner)
* [Manage users in bulk via CSV file](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/bulk-user-actions-add-delete-or-update-batches-users)

## Who are these docs for? [#who-is-doc-for]

This doc and the surrounding [section of docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles) shows you how to manage users who are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models). If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you very likely have users on our original user model (and not the [New Relic One user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles)). One way to quickly check the user model: if you can see users in the [**Users and roles** UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#view-access), these users are on our original user model.

## View pending SAML-SSO users [#pending-sso]

New Relic accounts with [SAML Single Sign On (SSO)](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers) may have a list of **Pending users**. These are individuals who have been [added to the SAML-enabled account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/adding-users-saml-accounts) but have not yet confirmed.

</Callout>

## Change the account Owner [#owner]

A New Relic account can have only one Owner [role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the [current Owner is unavailable](#no-owner), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

### Update the account Owner role [#owner]

You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin.

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
2. Above the Active users list, select <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
   **Change owner**. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available.
3. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account.
4. Refresh the page for changes to take effect.

Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role.

### Owner unavailable [#no-owner]

Anyone in the New Relic account can find out who is the current assigned Owner.

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
2. View the **Base role** column to locate your account Owner.

The <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
**Change owner** button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
