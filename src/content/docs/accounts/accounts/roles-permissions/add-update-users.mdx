## Change the account Owner

A New Relic account can have only one Owner [role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the [current Owner is unavailable](#no-owner), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

### Update the account Owner role

You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin.

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
2. Above the Active users list, select <Icon name="repeat"/>
   **Change owner**. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available.
3. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account.
4. Refresh the page for changes to take effect.

Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role.

### Owner unavailable

Anyone in the New Relic account can find out who is the current assigned Owner.

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown)** **>** **Account settings > Account > Users and roles**.
2. View the **Base role** column to locate your account Owner.

The <Icon name="repeat"/>
**Change owner** button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
