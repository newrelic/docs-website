New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from your identity provider. Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider.

## Requirements

Requirements and impacts:

* Requires Enterprise edition.
* [User model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models)-related requirements:
  * This feature creates users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
  * To implement AUM, you must be on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) and have [user management roles assigned](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#add-user-managers). If you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative.
* Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO).
* Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a [SCIM API](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/scim-support-automated-user-management).
* Notes on initial enabling of AUM:
  * We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as **Manual**, you can't change it to SCIM.
  * When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token.

## Set up automated user management (AUM) [#how-to]

For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see [Group and role mapping](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/roles-permissions-automated-user-management).

To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider:

1. It's important to first review the [requirements](#requirements). 
2. In the [authentication domain UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#ui), create a new authentication domain. 
3. Configure your identity provider using a relevant guide: [Azure AD](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/azure-scimsso-application-configuration) \| [Okta](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/okta-scimsso-application-configuration) \| [OneLogin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/onelogin-scimsso-application-configuration). 
    * If you **don't** use one of those services, you'll need to [enable SCIM as the source of users in our UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#source-users), implement SCIM using our [SCIM API](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/scim-support-automated-user-management), and [configure SAML SSO](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#saml).
5. Note that your users start out in New Relic as [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#user-type). If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), these users are billable. To convert users to free [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#user-type), use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#add-users).
6. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the "Olson" time zone database format (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles").

If you have issues, contact your account representative.

After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic.

To learn more about New Relic's roles and capabilities, see [Standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles).
