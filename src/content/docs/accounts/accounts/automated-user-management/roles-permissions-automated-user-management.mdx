With [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), your users and groups in your identity provider (like OneLogin or Okta) are synchronized with New Relic.

## How groups work [#group-example]

When using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you create groups of users in your identity provider service. Later, on the New Relic side, you'll [assign groups access to roles and accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts).

In the above example, let's focus on the Engineers group. Via SCIM, New Relic will receive the two user records as well as the information that they belong to the Engineers group. In this example, the configuration would be: the two Engineer users have the [**Read only** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#roles) on Account 1, the [**Standard user**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#roles) role on Account 2, and the [**All product admin**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#roles) role on Account 3.

This access is granted by [assigning several roles and accounts to the **Engineers** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts) in New Relic:

* Assign the role **Read only** to the group **Engineers** on Account 1
* Assign the role **Standard user** to the group **Engineers** on Account 2
* Assign the role **All product admin** to the group **Engineers** on Account 3
