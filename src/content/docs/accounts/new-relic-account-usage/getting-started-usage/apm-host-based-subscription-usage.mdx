<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have [host-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#host-based) (not [CU-based pricing](/docs/apm-cu-based-usage-attributes-queries)). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

## Data generation [#details]

Once per day, an APM account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type) for:

* Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours
* Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours

These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Application`. To query the host events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Host`.

All APM events use a `productLine` attribute value of `APM`. For more information, see [APM query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of **equivalent hosts** used during that month. An **equivalent host** is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see [host-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#host-based).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type).
</Callout>

To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **APM usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.
3. See the **Avg daily equivalent hosts** for an account or grouping of accounts.

The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## Table definitions [#details]

Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the **Group by** option selected at the top of the page.

## APM attributes (host-based) [#apm-attributes]

The following are usage-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute) generated by [host-based](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#host-based) APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `APM`.

        ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the `gethostname` Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. `agentHostname` is one of three possible providers for the [`hostId`](#hostid) value.

        Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage.

        When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: \`apmHoursUsed / 750\`.
      </td>

(For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like `i-1234abcd5678ef900`.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the `apmComputeUnitRule` is `cloud_provider_data`. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent.

      <td>
        For APM, this value can be either `Application` or `Host`, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for `usageType`). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways.

        For `Application`: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For `Host`: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day.

        Only `Host` entities are used to calculate billable usage. `Application` entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes.

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="last-month-query"
    title="Usage for last month"
  >
    This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month.

    ```
    SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 
    AS 'Equivalent hosts' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Host' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="per-host-app-query"
    title="Usage per host per application"
  >
    New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment).

    ```
    SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="instance-hours-per-app-query"
    title="Instance-hours per application"
  >
    This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage.

    Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity).

    ```
    SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agent-version-info"
    title="Agent version information"
  >
    Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID).

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT count(*) 
    WHERE productLine='APM' 
    AND usageType='Application' 
    FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 2000 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="legacy-usage-report"
    title="Legacy per-host usage report"
  >
    This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system:

          <td>
            This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the `SINCE` clause.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>

          </td>

          <td>
            NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more `WHERE` clauses to return subsets of the data (for example `WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”`) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Docker container IDs
          </td>

          <td>
            A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (`usageType='Application'`).

            For the host (`usageType='Host'`), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity.

          <td>
            `Business rule` has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated.

## Use of Docker and other containers [#containers]

Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage.

To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), [upgrade your APM agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent) to these versions:

* **Go**: 1.11 or higher
* **Java**: 3.42.0 or higher
* **.NET**: 6.19.330.0 or higher
* **Node.js**: 2.1.0 or higher
* **PHP**: 7.5.0.199 or higher
* **Python**: 2.90.0.75 or higher
* **Ruby**: 4.4.0.336 or higher
