<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

## Data generation [#data]

Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type). Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours.

To query Mobile usage data, use a `productLine` attribute value of `Mobile`. For more information, see the [Mobile query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs).

* For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a "user" for the purposes of this metric.
* For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type).
</Callout>

To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **Mobile usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.

The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## Table definitions [#table]

Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the **Group by** option selected at the top of the page.

## General attributes [#attributes]

The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#attribute). These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products.

When a parent account is the consuming account, `masterAccountId` is the [`consumingAccountId`](#consumingAccountId).

        This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account.

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="users-last-month"
    title="Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month"
  >
    A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month:

    ```
    SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' 
    SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```

    The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the `since` clause, for example:

    ```
    SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE '<var>2018-05-31</var>' UNTIL '<var>2018-06-01</var>'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="users-last-month-by-app"
    title="Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month"
  >
    A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name:

    ```
    SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' 
    SINCE last month UNTIL this month 
    FACET mobileAppName
    ```

    The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="unique-apps-last-month"
    title="Unique mobile apps in the last month"
  >
    This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month:

    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' 
    SINCE 1 month ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts):

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 1000 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
