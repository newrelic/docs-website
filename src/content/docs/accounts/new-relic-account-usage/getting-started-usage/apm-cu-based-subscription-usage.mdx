<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls.

## Data generation [#details]

Once per day, an APM account will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for:

* Every application instance created over the last 24 hours
* Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours

These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Application`. To query the host events, use a `usageType` attribute value of `Host`.

All APM events use a `productLine` attribute value of `APM`. For more information, see [APM query examples](#query-examples).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see [CU-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/compute-unit-cu-pricing-vs-host-based-pricing-apm-infrastructure#compute-unit).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
</Callout>

To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **APM usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.
3. Multiply the **Avg daily compute units** by the number of days in the current month.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Intro to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

## Table definitions [#details]

Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the **Group by** option selected at the top of the page.

        For APM, this value can be either `Application` or `Host`, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for `usageType`). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways.

        For `Application`: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For `Host`: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day.

        Only `Host` entities are used to calculate billable usage. `Application` entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes.

## Query examples

Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="last-month-query"
    title="Usage for last month"
  >
    ```
    SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Host' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="last-year-query"
    title="Monthly usage for last year"
  >
    ```
    SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits)
    FROM NrDailyUsage
    WHERE usageType='Host' 
    AND productLine='APM'
    FACET monthOf(timestamp) 
    SINCE 12 month ago limit 13
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="instance-hours-per-app-query"
    title="Instance-CUs per application"
  >
    This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage.

    Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity).

    ```
    SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE usageType='Application' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="Legacy host usage report">
    This query returns data once provided in the "host usage report": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI.

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT min(timestamp) 
    AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) 
    AS 'Latest reporting day' 
    FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    WHERE usageType='Application' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    SINCE 1 month ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="legacy-per-host-query"
    title="Legacy per-host usage report"
  >
    This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system:

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT consumingAccountId 
    AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider 
    AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType 
    AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize 
    AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed 
    AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits 
    AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) 
    AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount 
    AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount 
    AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule 
    AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId 
    WHERE productLine='APM' 
    AND usageType='Host' 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```

    This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Per-host query
          </th>

          <th>
            Comments
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Time period
          </td>

          <td>
            This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the `SINCE` clause.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Results limited to a maximum number of rows
          </td>

          <td>
            NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more `WHERE` clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, `WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”`) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Docker container IDs
          </td>

          <td>
            A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (`usageType='Application'`).

            For the host (`usageType='Host'`), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Business rule
          </td>

          <td>
            `Business rule` has been replaced with two attributes:

            * `apmComputeUnitRule` defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (`update_agent_for_container_environment`).
            * `missingCpuData`, `missingRamData`, and `instanceSizeCapped` are boolean flags describing what the value `missing_data` means when it is present in the `apmComputeUnitRule` attribute.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <Collapser
    id="agent-version-info"
    title="Agent version information"
  >
    Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID).

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT count(*) 
    WHERE productLine='APM' 
    AND usageType='Application' 
    FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agents-container-upgrades"
    title="Agents needing updates for container tracking"
  >
    This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected.

    Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a `hostId` value that is the same as the first part of the `containerId` value. The `apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’` clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container.

    ```
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SELECT latest(hostId) 
    WHERE containerId is not null 
    AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' 
    AND productLine='APM' 
    AND usageType='Application' 
    FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId 
    SINCE 1 day ago 
    LIMIT 2000
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts).

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

## Use of Docker or other containers [#containers]

Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage.

To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), [upgrade your APM agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent) to these versions:

* **Go**: 1.11 or higher
* **Java**: 3.42.0 or higher
* **.NET**: 6.19.330.0 or higher
* **Node.js**: 2.1.0 or higher
* **PHP**: 7.5.0.199 or higher
* **Python**: 2.90.0.75 or higher
* **Ruby**: 4.4.0.336 or higher
