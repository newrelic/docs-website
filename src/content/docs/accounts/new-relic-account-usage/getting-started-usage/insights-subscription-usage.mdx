<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for accounts on our original [Product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). If you're on the newer pricing plan, see [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).
</Callout>

For accounts on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing), this document explains:

* How New Relic calculates billable usage for an [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro).
* Available subscription usage attributes and [example NRQL queries](#query-examples) to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls.

## Data generation [#data]

Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) for every [event namespace](#namespace). A `NrDailyUsage` event includes a count of the events under that namespace.

To view the attributes for this event, see the `NrDailyUsage` [entry in the data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage).

## Usage calculations [#calculation]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Only the account **Owner** and **Admins** can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the `NrDailyUsage` [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic).
</Callout>

To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage:

1. Go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
2. On the **Insights usage** page, set the time picker to **Current month**.

For more information about the usage UI, see [Introduction to subscription usage data](/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/getting-started-usage/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

The Insights usage UI only displays **paid events**: these are events that count towards an [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro). It does **not** display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also [query the product included events](#query-examples).

How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's [data retention period](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention). For a list of the applicable event types, see [Event namespaces](#namespace).

## Table definitions [#details]

Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the **Group by** option you select in the UI.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

## Event namespaces (types) [#namespace]

An [Insights Pro subscription](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention#insights-pro) governs the data retention of certain types of events. An event's namespace (indicated by the [`insightsEventNamespace`](#insightsEventNamespace) attribute) corresponds to one or more event types that share a single [data retention](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components) policy.

## Query examples

To get the most out of your Insights usage data, you can:

* Run queries of this data and create custom charts and dashboards.
* Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs.

For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see [Introduction to usage data](/docs/introduction-new-relic-subscription-usage-data).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Insights writes usage events [once per day](#data). That is why these queries use `since 24 hours ago` or `timeseries 1 day`.
</Callout>

Here are some NRQL query examples about usage.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-account-events"
    title="Stored event usage for last month"
  >
    This query will tell you the "billable" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events.

    ```
    SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) 
    AS 'Paid events' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE last month 
    UNTIL this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-single-account"
    title="Current Insights usage for an account"
  >
    This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by [event namespace](#insightsEventNamespace). Be sure to replace <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> in these queries with your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    ```
    SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE 24 hours ago 
    WHERE consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> 
    FACET insightsEventNamespace
    ```

    This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces:

    ```
    SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE 24 hours ago 
    WHERE consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-multiple-accounts"
    title="Current Insights usage for multiple accounts"
  >
    This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by [event namespace](#insightsEventNamespace). Note that you will need to replace <var>LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs</var> in the query with a list of [account IDs](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    ```
    SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago 
    WHERE consumingAccountId 
    IN (<var>LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs</var>) 
    FACET consumingAccountId, insightsEventNamespace 
    LIMIT 100
    ```

    You may need to increase the value in the `limit` clause to see all of the facets in this query.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-product"
    title="Events included with other New Relic products"
  >
    This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events that are included with other New Relic product subscriptions were stored for an account, by the product that created them, over the past seven days. Note that you will need to replace <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> in the query with your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    ```
    SELECT sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE 7 days ago 
    WHERE consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> 
    FACET insightsNrProduct 
    TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-subaccount"
    title="Retention periods by child account and event namespace"
  >
    This query will tell you the total, paid, and included retention periods for the different event categories associated with the various New Relic products (such as APM `Transaction` events), for each child account under the specified parent account ID. When creating your own NRQL queries, be sure to replace <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> with your specific [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    ```
    SELECT latest(insightsTotalRetentionInHours)/24 
    AS 'Total retention, days', latest(insightsIncludedRetentionInHours)/24 
    AS 'Included retention, days', (latest(insightsTotalRetentionInHours) - 
    latest(insightsIncludedRetentionInHours))/24 
    AS 'Paid retention, days' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage where productLine='Insights' 
    AND masterAccountId = <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var> 
    FACET consumingAccountId,consumingAccountName,insightsEventNamespace 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-pro-subaccount"
    title="Paid Insights usage by child account"
  >
    This query will tell you how many events under an Insights Pro subscription are being consumed by each child account for the specified parent account ID over the past seven days. When creating your own NRQL queries, be sure to replace <var>YOUR_MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID</var> in the query with your specific parent [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    ```
    SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) 
    AS 'Paid events' from NrDailyUsage 
    SINCE 7 days ago 
    WHERE masterAccountId = <var>YOUR_MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID</var> 
    FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName 
    TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-hierarchy-query"
    title="Account hierarchy"
  >
    This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

    ```
    SELECT count(*) 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,
    consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId 
    LIMIT 1000 
    SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
