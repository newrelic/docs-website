This tutorial will walk you through adding and managing accounts and users.

## Before you start [#requirements]

Before you start this tutorial, some things to understand:

* Pro or Enterprise [edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#editions) is required
* This tutorial is for managing users who are on our [newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models) (true of almost all New Relic users)
* This tutorial will be easier if you first have a basic understanding of:
  * [Organization and account concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure#new-model)
  * [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts)
* This presents one recommended workflow but no particular order of steps is required.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Organization creation and setup [#create-organization]

    When you [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup), your New Relic organization is created. The organization structure represents a New Relic customer: it's what contains everything relevant to a customer's use of New Relic: their accounts, their users, and their data.

    When a New Relic organization is created, it contains a single account. Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can add more accounts.

    When your organization is created, it has two default user groups, which have roles and accounts already assigned. When you add users via the UI, there are two default groups you can assign users to:

    * <DNT>**Admin**</DNT>: can use and configure observability features for that initial account, and the ability to view and configure organization-wide administration settings (like adding accounts, managing authentication settings, and adding/removing users).
    * <DNT>**User**</DNT>: can use and configure observability features (but lacks access to the admin abilities that the <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> group has).

    You can see the access assigned for these default groups by going to the <DNT>**Access management**</DNT> UI:

    1. Log in to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/).
    2. Click your user name, then <DNT>**Administration > Access Management**</DNT>.

    <img

      alt="New Relic organization and access UI - default group access"
      src="/images/accounts_screenshot-crop_User-mgmt-groups-UI.webp"
    />

    You can see how the <DNT>**User**</DNT> group has the <DNT>**All product admin**</DNT> role and access to that initially created account. And you can see how the <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> group has some administration settings assigned. The `Default` next to those group names refers to them being in the original, default authentication domain.

    If you want to create admins who can only add and remove users, and who don't have the more powerful organization-wide admin capabilities that the <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> group has, you can use the [<DNT>**Group admin**</DNT> role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#group-admin).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add accounts [#add-accounts]

    Before adding your users in New Relic, you might want to [get some data reporting](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/get-started-full-stack-observability) and set up additional accounts.

    For reasons why you might want to create more accounts, see [Organization structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#new-model).

    For how to add accounts, see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Set up authentication domains [#auth-domains]

    When your organization is first created, the groups and users are located in a default authentication domain, named `Default`. An authentication domain is a grouping of New Relic users governed by the same user management settings, like how they're provisioned (added and updated), how they authenticate (log in), session settings, and how user upgrades are handled.

    The default authentication domain settings are:

    * Users are manually added and managed via the New Relic UI
    * Users manually log in to New Relic using their email and password

    Having that single domain will be fine for many organizations, but some larger organizations want one or both of the following:

    * Single sign-on (SAML SSO)
    * Managing their users from their identity provider via SCIM provisioning

    If you need single sign-on or SCIM provisioning, you'll have to create an additional authentication domain. Note that groups and users are contained within authentication domains, and you can't easily change an authentication domain's provisioning setting or authentication setting once the domain is created: this means you should spend some time thinking about what your authentication domain settings should be before you add users to them.

    If you want to use SAML SSO or SCIM provisioning, see these options:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="scim-and-saml"
        title="SCIM and SAML SSO"
      >
        For how to set up SCIM provisioning and SAML SSO, see our [automated user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign#how-to). When you're done, ensure you can see the groups from your identity provider in the <DNT>**Access management**</DNT> UI.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="saml-only"
        title="SAML SSO only (not SCIM)"
      >
        For how to set up SAML SSO, see the [SSO docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more#authentication). When you're done, return here to continue this tutorial.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Create custom roles (optional) [#roles]

    We have several default-available roles, which we call [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles). Some of these are assigned to the <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> and <DNT>**User**</DNT> groups that are available by default.

    If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create your own custom roles. Creating custom roles is optional. If you don't have a need for custom roles, you can skip this section.

    Some tips to help you understand what roles are:

    * Users are assigned to groups (for example, the default <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> and <DNT>**User**</DNT> groups), and those groups are assigned various roles and accounts. Put another way: it's not the group that gives users access to New Relic permissions: it's the roles.
    * A role contains various permissions. For example: the permission to create and modify alert conditions, or the permission to delete data ingest license keys (for more information, see [Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions)).
    * Unlike groups and users, roles are not contained in an authentication domain: they're available across the entire organization.

    To view existing roles: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Access management**</DNT>, and then click <DNT>**Roles**</DNT>.

    To create a custom role, click <DNT>**Add new custom role**</DNT>. Review the list of available permissions and decide which ones your custom role needs.

    Here's a short video showing how to create a custom role (4:07 minutes):

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Create groups and assign access [#group-access]

    Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. You assign groups one or more roles on one or more accounts.

    To set up groups optimally, you'll need to think about what groups you'll need, what roles those groups should have, and what account access those groups should have.

    If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few extra group configurations. For example, you might decide to add more accounts to the existing default <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> or <DNT>**User**</DNT> groups. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create new groups with access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles).

    For an example user access planning spreadsheet, see our [group access planning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FnguDXRUX9FGY14oV4Gx6O08v4vNC2Pv0GGCsU7Pxuw/edit?usp=sharing).

    To view existing groups: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>, and then click <DNT>**Access management**</DNT>. Under the <DNT>**Groups**</DNT> tab, you'll see the existing groups and what access they've been assigned.

    You can manage groups via either the UI or via API:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="grants-ui"
        title="Manage group access via the UI"
      >
        Before adding access to groups, ensure you have a good understanding of the [user management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts) and the access your users should have.

        To add access to groups in the UI:

        1. From the <DNT>**Access management**</DNT> UI, click <DNT>**Groups**</DNT>.
        2. You can create a new group or edit an existing one:
           * To create a new group, click <DNT>**Create new group**</DNT> and follow the instructions.
           * To edit an existing one, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the group you want to edit. Click <DNT>**View group details**</DNT> and edit the group's access.

        When you're done, if users are already assigned to the group you created or edited, those users will have the new access within a few minutes (although for [EU region organizations](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers), this may take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true for a newly created group), the next step will show you how to add users.

        Some tips for using this UI:

        * Want to understand the roles and administration settings better? See [Roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#roles).
        * When selecting from amongst our [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles), it's important to understand the difference between <DNT>**All product admin**</DNT> and <DNT>**Standard user**</DNT>. <DNT>**All product admin**</DNT> is a more popular choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure the settings for those features, you'd choose <DNT>**Standard user**</DNT>.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="grants-api"
        title="Manage group access via API"
      >
        For how to manage group access via the API, see [NerdGraph user management](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-user-mgmt#concepts).
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add users [#add-users]

    Due to how we bill per calendar month, there are reasons you may want to wait until the beginning of a month to add users. For more on that, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-count).

    If you're using SCIM provisioning, you should be done at this point because your groups and users are imported from your identity provider. You can move to the [verification step](#verification).

    Otherwise, you'll need to add users. In the [user management UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/users-list), you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to.

    Suggested steps for adding users via the UI:

    1. To view users and see their groups: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>, and click <DNT>**User management**</DNT>.
    2. Optional: select your authentication domain using the domain switcher. (Remember that groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain).
    3. To add a user, click <DNT>**Add user**</DNT>. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and group. Any custom groups you've added are available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has a role and account assigned, once you add the user to that group, that user will have access.

    To edit a user's group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes. For tips on bulk editing and other common tasks, see [Common user management tasks](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#workflow).

    You can also use our NerdGraph API to [add and manage users](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Verify things are working [#verify]

    Ideas for checking that your users are configured correctly:

    * Go to the <DNT>**User management**</DNT> UI and <DNT>**Access management**</DNT> UI and see if the groups and grants assignments look correct and make sense.
    * Have some of your users see if they can log in and access the accounts they expect to see.

    Ideas for next steps:

    * [Set up more New Relic integrations](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/intro-new-relic)
    * Add more users
