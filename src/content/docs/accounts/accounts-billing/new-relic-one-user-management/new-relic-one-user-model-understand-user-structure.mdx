  New Relic One
  user model
---

In mid-2020, New Relic released a newer user model, referred to as the New Relic One user model. 

<Callout variant="important">
  If you had a New Relic organization created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). For more on this, see [Pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#determine-user-model).
</Callout>

## Overview 

This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including:

* [User type](#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
* [User groups](#groups)
* [User roles and capabilities](#roles) and how those relate to user type and groups

For how to add and manage users in the UI, see [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants).

## User type: basic and full [#user-type]

  <Callout variant="important">
This section is for users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). If you're on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#user-type).
    </Callout>

The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to.

Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans).

* **Basic user**. Details:
  * These users are free and have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do **not** have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities)).
  * No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the [capabilities of a basic user](#user-capabilities): no more and no less.
  * Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see upgrade prompts when attempting to access an unavailable feature. For details, see [Upgrade](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#session-mgmt).
* **Full user**. Details:
  * Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. 
  * Full users also enjoy extended functionality through a rich catalog of applications, as well as the ability to use custom built applications.
  * For details on what's available, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities). 
  * For organizations on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans): these users are [billable](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#user-count). The Standard [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) includes one free full user and up to five total.

For how to edit user type, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

To assign users to other accounts in your organization, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

    Below is a table showing basic user versus full user capabilities. In short: basic users have access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](https://newrelic.com/platform) and [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform) features, while full users have access to all of that plus [Full-Stack Observability](https://newrelic.com/platform) features.

    Note that this is a list of theoretically available capabilities. In practice, a full users' capabilities may be limited due to being in a group that has limited capabilities.

    Reasons to make someone a full user:

    * They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle.
    * They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team.
    * They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD).
    * They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform.
    * They need to be able to manage users and/or billing.

    Reasons to make someone a basic user:

    * They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle.
    * They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team).
    * They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives).
    * They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform.
    * They don't manage users.

## User management concepts [#concepts]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

The following sections contain definitions of our default groups (**User** and **Admin**), our standard roles and capabilities, and some relations between these areas. If you're an organization with multiple New Relic accounts, we recommend first reading [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

## Default groups: Admin and User [#groups]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

A user group allows managing multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group and that group is granted access to specific roles and specific accounts.

Full users can be added to one of two default groups:

* **User**: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but **not** perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users.
* **Admin**: Adding someone to this group gives them all capabilities.

See the [roles and capabilities these default groups have](#group-roles).

For Pro and Enterprise tiers, you can control access to roles and accounts using [access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/organization-level-user-management-roles-groups-access-grants). 

To change the group a user is in, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

## Roles and capabilities [#roles]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

Roles are a set of capabilities. A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions'. 

We provide some default standard roles (below). Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can also create [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

### Standard roles

Our standard roles are default sets of capabilities that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. These roles are [assigned to our default **Admin** and **User** groups](#group-roles). 

Standard roles include:

### Roles and user groups [#group-roles]

There are two default user groups: [**User** and **Admin**](#groups). These groups have our [standard roles](#standard-roles) applied in these ways:

* **User**: this group has only the **All product admin** standard role, which grants general platform access and some basic admin capabilities.
* **Admin**: this group has all the standard roles, giving it complete admin capabilities.

For Pro and Enterprise tiers, custom groups can be [assigned standard roles or custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

### Roles and user type [#user-type-roles]

[User type](#user-type) refers to whether a user is a basic user or a full user.

A basic user can be defined as having the **All product admin** [standard role](#standard-roles) but without access to Full-Stack Observability features ([learn more](#user-type)). A basic user always has basic user capabilities, no more and no less, regardless of what group they're assigned to. One non-intuitive impact of this is that a group's basic users could have more capabilities than its full users have. For example, if you created a custom group with very minimal capabilities, the full users in that group would have those minimal capabilities, but any basic users in that group would have more capabilities than the full users because the capabilities of a basic user trump group capabilities.

A full user's capabilities will depend on its assigned group; it has theoretical access to all roles and capabilities.

For more on this, see [User type](#user-type).

### Custom roles and capabilities [#custom-roles]

For tips on setting up custom roles, see [Add custom groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).

## Manage users

To learn how to add users, and create custom groups and roles, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/add-manage-users-groups-roles).
