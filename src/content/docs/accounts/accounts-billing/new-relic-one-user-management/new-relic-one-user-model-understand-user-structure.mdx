Your New Relic organization users can be on one of two account/user structures that we have: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. 

<Callout variant="important">
  If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). For more on this, see [Pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).
</Callout>

## Overview 

This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including:

* [User type](#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
* [Default user groups](#groups)
* [User roles and capabilities](#roles)

For how to add and manage users in the UI, see [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants).

## User type: basic and full [#user-type]

  <Callout variant="important">
This section is for users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). If you're on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#user-type).
    </Callout>

The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. 

Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans).

* **Basic user**. Details:
  * These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do **not** have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some advanced Applied Intelligence features (for a comparison of abilities, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities)).
  * No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the [capabilities of a basic user](#user-capabilities): no more and no less.
  * Basic users will see prompts for upgrading to a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see [Upgrade](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#session-mgmt).
* **Full user**. Details:
  * Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities).
  * [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) includes one free full user and up to five total full users.
  * A full user can downgrade to a basic user [twice in a 12-month period](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#user-count).

Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](https://newrelic.com/platform) and some [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform) features, while full users have theoretical access to all features (dependent on any group-related restrictions).

  A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user [only twice in one year](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#user-count). Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. 
  
  Reasons to make someone a full user:

    * They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle.
    * They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team.
    * They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD).
    * They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform.
    * They need to be able to manage users and/or billing.

    Reasons to make someone a basic user:

    * They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle.
    * They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team).
    * They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives).
    * They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform.
    * They don't manage users.

    If you're on the [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see [Calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#user-count).

## Default groups: Admin and User [#groups]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

A user group allows managing multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group and that group is granted access to specific roles and specific accounts.

Full users can be added to one of two default groups:

* **User**: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but **not** perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users.
* **Admin**: This group has all [standard roles](#standard-roles). 

Organizations with Pro and Enterprise edition can create custom groups, and control access to roles and accounts using [access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/organization-level-user-management-roles-groups-access-grants). 

To change the group a user is in, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).


## Relationship between user type, roles, and groups [#type-role-group]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

Here's a table explaining how [user type](#user-type) (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>

      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Full user
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Basic user
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Group**
      </td>

      <td>
        Full users can be assigned to [default groups](#groups) (**User** and **Admin**) or custom groups. 
      </td>

      <td>
        Basic users, no matter what group they're assigned to, **always** have [basic user](#user-type) abilities, no more and no less. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Role**
      </td>

      <td>
Here are the roles our [default groups](#groups) have: 

* **User** group: has the [**All product admin** standard role](#standard-role), which includes some feature-related administrative abilities but not more advanced organization-level or user management admin abilities.
* **Admin** group: has complete admin capabilities, which is the equivalent of all our [standard roles](#standard-roles), including the more advanced organization-level and user management roles. 

Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles.
      </td>

      <td>
A basic user's abilities aren't directly related to roles. A basic user can best be described as having the [**All product admin** role](#standard-roles) but without access to most of our curated UI experiences ([learn more about user type](#user-type)).

## Roles and capabilities [#roles]

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

Roles are a set of capabilities. A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' ([learn more about capabilities](#capabilities)). 

We provide some default standard roles (below). Organizations on Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) can also create [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

### Standard (default) roles [#standard-roles]

Our standard roles are default sets of [capabilities](#capabilities) that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. 

<Callout variant="important">
Note that some of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are **Standard user** and **Read only**; all others have special hidden abilities. 
</Callout>


Our standard roles include:

### Capabilities [#capabilities]

A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom one, is defined as a set of capabilities. In the [**Organization and access** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where), when you choose a role or create a custom role, you can see the available capabilities. 

<Callout variant="important">
Some of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see [Standard roles](#standard-roles).
