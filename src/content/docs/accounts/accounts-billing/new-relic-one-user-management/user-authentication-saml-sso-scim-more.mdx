  This doc is for managing users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure). For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). [Learn about user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
</Callout>

To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure "authentication domains," which control how users are added to your New Relic account and how they’re authenticated.

## Requirements

To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the [authentication domain settings UI](#ui) and see if you can configure settings.

Requirements to configure authentication domains:

* [Pro tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) required (Enterprise tied required for automated user management)
* These features allow managing users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles). To learn more, see [Overview of pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
* You must be in a user group that has the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles).

## What is an authentication domain? [#auth-domain-definition]

An "authentication domain" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings regarding how users are provisioned (added) and how they are authenticated (logged in).

When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are:

* Users are manually added to New Relic
* Users manually log in using their username and password

Those default settings would be under one "authentication domain." Another authentication domain might be set up like this:

* Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD)
* Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider

When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider.

Configurable elements of an authentication domain include:

* Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider)
* Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO).
* Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle)

## Configure authentication domain via UI [#ui]

If you meet the [requirements](#requirements), you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Organization and access**, and then click **Authentication domains**.

For more about the configuration options, keep reading.

## Source of users [#source-users]

From the [authentication domain UI](#ui), you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic:

* Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic.
* SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. **Requires Enterprise tier.**

To set up automated user management, see our [AUM docs](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign).

## Authentication

The authentication method is used by all users in an authentication domain. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they can access any New Relic account they've been granted permissions for.

There are two authentication options:

* Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password.
* SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider.

<Callout variant="tip">
  How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO.
</Callout>

### Configure SAML SSO [#saml]

To set up SAML SSO from the [authentication domain UI](#ui):

1. Under **Authentication**, click **Configure**.
2. Under **Method of authenticating users**, select **SAML SSO**.
3. Under **Provided by New Relic**, review your New Relic SAML service provider details.
4. Under **Provided by you**, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting **Upload a certificate** and selecting **Choose file**. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration.
   </Callout>
5. Under **Provided by you**, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider.
6. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the **Logout redirect URL**; otherwise, leave it blank.

## Session management [#session-mgmt]

From the [authentication domain UI](#ui), you can configure some session-related settings, including:

* How long users remain logged in for
* The maximum amount of time the browser can remain idle before logout
