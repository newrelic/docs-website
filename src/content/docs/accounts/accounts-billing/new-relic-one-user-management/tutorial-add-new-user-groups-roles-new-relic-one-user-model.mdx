This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model.

## Requirements

Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements:

* This tutorial is for managing users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
* Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise tier. For details, see [user management requirements](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#requirements).
* [Role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#standard-roles) requirements:
  * Using the **Organization and access** UI to manage group access requires **Authentication domain manager** and **Organization manager** roles.
  * Using the **User management** UI to add/edit users requires **Authentication domain manager** role.

## Overview

Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs:

* [Where to find user management features in the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where)
* [Important user management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts)

This tutorial will walk you through how to:

* [View available accounts](#accounts)
* [How to grant groups access to roles and accounts](#group-access) 
* [How to create custom roles](#roles)
* [How to add users to groups](#add-users)

## View available accounts [#accounts]

Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to.

To view the accounts in your organization: go to the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Organizations and access**, and then click **Accounts**.

## Grant groups access to roles and accounts [#group-access]

Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: [**Admin** and **User**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#group-roles). These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and they are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you're on our Pro or Enterprise tier, you additionally have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization.

Note that you can also [import users from your identity provider](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign).
</Callout>

To view existing group access grants: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Organization and access**.

To create a new group access: 

1. From the **Organization and access** UI, click **Group access**.
2. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing or new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about the concepts, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).
3. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under **Scope**, select **Organization** and choose an available role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see [Standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#roles). (These users must also have an account-scoped role; without that, you may see a message that the user is not in an organization.)
4. Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select **Add another** at the bottom before clicking **Add access**.  

Some important tips to understand when managing groups:

* If a group has basic users in it, their [basic user status overrides any role limitations in that group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#user-type).
* When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group.

## Create custom role [#roles]

When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our [default roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#roles) with default capabilities or create your own roles with unique capabilities.

To view existing roles: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Organization and access**, and then click **Roles**.

To create a custom role, click **Add new custom role**.

To learn more about these concepts, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

## Add users [#add-users]

If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. 

To view or manage users: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **User management**. If you don’t see that option, review the [requirements](#requirements).

Groups reside within the boundaries of an [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts). If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in.

To add a user, click **Add user**. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#user-type) and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access.

To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.
