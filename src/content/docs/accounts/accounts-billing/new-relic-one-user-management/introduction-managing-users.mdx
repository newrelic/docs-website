The docs in this section are about managing users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). For original user model docs, see [Original user management](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). 

Here are our docs about managing New Relic One user model users: 

* [User permission concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts): learn about how users get access to specific capabilities and to specific accounts. 
* [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): learn about basic users, core users, and full platform users. 
* [Common user management tasks](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/): learn where to find the user management UI, how to add users, edit user type, add users to groups, create custom roles, and more. 
* [Authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): an "authentication domain" is what governs how users in that domain are added to New Relic (manually versus SCIM provisioning), the authentication method used by those users (manual login versus SAML SSO), managing how users upgrade their user type, and user session settings.
* [User management tutorials](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model): more in-depth tutorials for user management tasks.  
* [User management UI videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos): watch videos of the user management UI in action. 
* [Introduction to SAML and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim): an overview of SAML SSO and SCIM options.
