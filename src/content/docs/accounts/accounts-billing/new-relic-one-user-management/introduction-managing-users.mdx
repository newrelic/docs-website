  This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). [Learn about user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
</Callout>

We provide several ways for you to manage your New Relic users. Here are our main docs related to managing users:

* [User model/structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles): learn some basic aspects of our user model, such as user type (basic user vs full user), default groups (**Admin** and **User**), and roles and capabilities.
* [Managing users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): an overview of user management concepts, some common user management tasks, and where to manage users in the UI.
* A [tutorial on how to create new groups, roles, and access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model)
* [Authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): configure an authentication domain, which governs how your users are added to New Relic (manually versus using an identity provider), the authentication method they use (via manual login versus SAML SSO), managing how basic users become full users, and user session settings.
* Having problems logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems).
* To understand user-related billing factors, see [User-related billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#user-count).
