For setting up automatic controls over how your New Relic users are added to New Relic, how they're managed, and how they log in, we offer these features:

* <DNT>**SAML SSO**</DNT>: this allows your users to use a single sign-on (SSO) identity provider service to log in to New Relic, as opposed to using the default email + password. Requires a [paid edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions).
* <DNT>**SCIM provisioning**</DNT>, also referred to as automated user management: SCIM provisioning allows organizations to use their identity provider service to automate how their users are added to and updated in New Relic. Organizations using SCIM will almost always use SAML SSO. Requires [Pro or Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions).

For information on how to enable SAML and SCIM, choose your user model below. If you're not sure which you're on, see [Overview of user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).

    For users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), you'll use the [authentication domain UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) to set up SAML and SCIM. Note that Okta, OneLogin, and Azure have dedicated New Relic apps: if you use those, you must choose the one called "New Relic by organization", and not "New Relic by account".

    If your organization is on the original user model, we recommend migrating your users via the [self-serve migration procedure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration) if you're able to. If you don't meet the requirements but want to enable SAML and/or SCIM, please speak to your New Relic account representative.

    Here are some tips and docs links:

    * SAML: If you want to or must stay on the original user model and can't migrate to the new model, see our [original SAML docs](/docs/accounts/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers).
    * SCIM + SAML: SCIM provisioning creates user records on our newer user model. This is why we recommend you to first migrate your users to the new user model before using SCIM. For more on how to migrate to the new model, see [Migrate users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration).
