Feature control manager allows organization administrators to activate and manage intelligent observability and standalone advanced features across multiple accounts in their organization. This gives you centralized control over which features are available and billed in your organization.

## Use cases[#use-cases]

Feature control manager helps you:

* **Control feature rollouts**: Gradually activate advanced features across specific accounts rather than organization-wide.
* **Manage costs**: Only activate and pay for features when you're ready to use them.
* **Centralize administration**: Manage feature access from a single location instead of configuring each account individually.
* **Maintain compliance**: Ensure only authorized accounts have access to specific observability capabilities.


## Requirements and access [#requirements]

To use Feature control manager, you need:

* **Organization administration permissions**: You must have [organization admin access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts) with the ability to manage account settings.
* **Intelligent Observability features**: Your organization must have purchased intelligent observability or standalone advanced features.

## Access the Feature Control manager [#access]

To access the Feature Control manager:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click your user name in the bottom left corner.
2. From the <DNT>**Plan management**</DNT> section, select <DNT>**Feature Control**</DNT>.

The <DNT>**Feature Control**</DNT> page displays all intelligent observability and standalone advanced features available to your organization, showing their current activation status across your accounts. To get the active features for specific accounts, search with the account IDs in the search field.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Most features can be activated or deactivated for specific accounts. However, organization-scoped features like <DNT>**Teams**</DNT> apply to all accounts in your organization automatically.
</Callout>

## Activate features for specific accounts [#activate-features]

1. From the <DNT>**Feature Control**</DNT> page, find the feature you want to activate in the accounts.
2. If the feature is already active, click <DNT>**Add account**</DNT>, or else click <DNT>**Select accounts**</DNT>. 
3. In the account selection modal, select the accounts where you want to activate the feature.
4. Click <DNT>**Activate feature**</DNT> and confirm the action in the follow-up prompt.

<Callout variant="important">
  After activation, features begin billing from the activation date. Make sure you're ready to use the feature before activating it.
</Callout>

## View active features [#view-features]

After activation, the Feature Control Manager shows:

* **Active features**: Features currently enabled in your organization.
* **Account details**: A table under each feature showing which accounts have the feature active.
* **Activation dates**: When each feature was activated for each account.

This gives you a complete view of feature usage across your organization.

## Deactivate features for specific accounts [#deactivate-features]

To deactivate a feature for specific accounts:

1. From the <DNT>**Feature Control**</DNT> page, expand the active feature you want to deactivate.
2. Select the accounts in which you want to deactivate this feature.
3. Click <DNT>**Deactivate**</DNT> and confirm the action in the follow-up prompt.

## Managing feature access over time [#manage-access]

Feature Control Manager provides ongoing management capabilities:

* **Monitor usage**: Track which accounts are using which features.
* **Review costs**: Understand billing impact by seeing activation dates and account usage.
* **Plan rollouts**: Use the account selection to gradually expand feature usage.
