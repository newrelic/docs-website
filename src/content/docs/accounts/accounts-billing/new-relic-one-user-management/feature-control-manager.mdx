Feature control manager allows organization administrators to activate and manage Intelligent Observability features across multiple accounts in their organization. This gives you centralized control over which advanced features are available and billed in your organization.

## Use cases[#use-cases]

Feature control manager helps you:

* **Control feature rollouts**: Gradually activate advanced features across specific accounts rather than organization-wide.
* **Manage costs**: Only activate and pay for features when you're ready to use them.
* **Centralize administration**: Manage feature access from a single location instead of configuring each account individually.
* **Maintain compliance**: Ensure only authorized accounts have access to specific observability capabilities.


## Requirements and access [#requirements]

To use Feature Control Manager, you need:

* **Organization administration permissions**: You must have organization admin access with the ability to manage account settings.
* **Pro or Enterprise edition**: Feature Control Manager is available for organizations with [Pro or Enterprise editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing).
* **Intelligent Observability features**: Your organization must have opted into Intelligent Observability features that support account-level activation.
