* **Control feature rollouts**: Gradually activate advanced features across specific accounts rather than organization-wide.
* **Manage costs**: Only activate and pay for features when you're ready to use them.

* **Maintain compliance**: Ensure only authorized accounts have access to specific observability capabilities.
