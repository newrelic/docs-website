Here we'll explain how New Relic users get access to specific capabilities and specific accounts.

## Main ways permission is controlled: user type and roles [#user-type-groups-relation]

When it comes to what New Relic features your users can access, there are two main settings at work:

* The [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): For organizations on [our usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), your users' user type is a billing factor. The user type is what sets the maximum allowed capabilities a user can access. It's meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on someone's expected New Relic duties.
* The roles assigned: after a user's user type is decided, **roles** can be used to more precisely control a user's access. Roles are sets of **capabilities**, which are the granular New Relic abilities (for example, the ability to modify New Relic APM settings). Roles are assigned by applying them to a [user group](#groups).

Another way to think about the relationship between a user's user type and their assigned roles: a user's user type overrides all role restrictions. For example: a basic user might be assigned a role that has broad New Relic access, but restrictions related to [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) take precedence over any role-granted access. To see how user type relates to roles, see the [roles table](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles).

This doc is focused on role-related permissions. For details about user types, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

## Groups give users access to New Relic [#understand-concepts]

In order for a New Relic user to be able to access New Relic features, they must be in a [group](#groups) and that group must have access to: 

* A specific [role](#roles) (a role being a set of specific, granular [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities)).
* One or more accounts.

Organizations with [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) can have multiple accounts in their organization, and can create custom roles and groups. Standard edition organizations are only allowed a single account in their organization, and don't have the ability to create custom roles or groups.

When you initially sign up for New Relic, your organization has some built-in role and account assignments for the default [**User** or **Admin** groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#groups). For example, the **Admin** group has several role assignments that give users in that group broad New Relic access, including to the higher level administrative capabilities.

* [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).

## Groups [#groups]

A "group" represents a group of users. Putting users in a group allows the managing of permissions for multiple users at the same time. For example, if you're using our [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) feature, you can import a custom group of users (for example, **External consultants**) from your identity provider service, and then [grant a role and an account](#understand-concepts) to that group. 

A New Relic user must be in at least one group with access to a role and at least one account.

Note that groups are **not** what restrict a user's New Relic permissions: it's the **role** assigned to the group that contains the actual capabilities.

We have two default groups (see below). And Pro and Enterprise organizations can [create custom groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#group-access).

Users and groups are located within an [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/), which is what controls settings related to how users are added and managed (for example, via SCIM provisioning) and how users log in to New Relic.

### Our default user groups [#default-groups]

We have two default user groups:

* **User**: This group allows a user to use and configure our observability and monitoring features but **not** perform account-level tasks like managing billing or managing other users. It has access to the [**All product admin**](#standard-roles) role, which gives access to our observability platform tools, but doesn't have any [administration settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings), which give access to the higher level account and user management capabilities.
* **Admin**: has all capabilities, including the higher-level administration settings. This is the equivalent of having the [standard role](#standard-roles) of **All product admin** with all available [administration settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings). 

To change a user's group, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where).

## Roles [#roles]

**Roles** are groupings of [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities), which are the granular things New Relic users can do (for example, the ability to manage data retention). We have several default roles, described below. And Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can create custom roles.

To view roles and their capabilities, go to the [**Access management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) and click **Roles**. Note that the roles UI doesn't show [administration settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings).

### Our standard (default) roles [#standard-roles]

We have several "standard roles," which are roles that are available by default and that satisfy some commonly needed sets of capabilities.

<Callout variant="important">
  Note that some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for adding to a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are **Standard user** and **Read only**; all others have some hidden capabilities.
</Callout>

Here's a table with our standard roles. To better understand the account-scoped roles, go to the **Access management** UI and select a role.

<table>

        **All product admin**
      </td>

      <td>
        This role includes all New Relic platform capabilities **except** the ability to manage organization-level settings, users, and billing. It's an admin role in the sense that it allows the configuration of our platform features (for example, the ability to configure APM settings), but it doesn't provide organization-level admin capabilities. This role is essentially the **Standard user** role plus the ability to configure platform features.
      </td>

      </td>

      <td>
        Provides access to our platform features (for example, APM UI and browser monitoring UI), but lacks permissions to configure those features and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. This role is essentially the **All product admin** role without the ability to configure platform features.

      </td>

      <td>
        Any.

    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>

      <td>
        For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models), this role lets you manage those "v1" users. This is used primarily for overseeing a [user migration process](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/).
      </td>

      <td>
        Required: full platform.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).

## Administration settings [#admin-settings]

When you create or edit a group, you can add **Administration settings** that control access to various organization-scoped capabilities. 

<Callout variant="tip">
In July of 2022, we removed some organization-scoped roles and replaced them with similarly named **Administration settings**. If you had these roles assigned to groups, they've been converted to the equivalent settings. 
</Callout>

Administration settings require you to have a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of core or full platform. A group can't have only an administration setting assigned: the group must have at least one account assigned. 

Settings include: 

* **Organization settings**: Provides capabilities related to organization settings, including adding accounts, changing the name of the organization and accounts, and some other organization settings.
* **Authentication domain settings**: Provides capabilities related to adding and managing users, including configuring authentication domains and customizing groups and roles. 
* **Billing**: Lets a user manage subscriptions and billing setup. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account.

## Capabilities [#capabilities]

For information on the capabilities that roles have and that are available for addition to custom roles, see [Capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities).

## Manage users

To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks).

## Tips for setting up group access [#access-grant-tips]

Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can create and configure group access. To set up groups optimally, you'll need to think about what groups you'll need, what roles those groups should have, and what account access those groups should have.

If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few extra group configurations. For example, you might decide to add more accounts to the existing default **Admin** or **User** groups. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create new groups with access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles).

Some tips on customizing group access:

* See the [Tutorial on user management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
* To see the UI in action, see our [user management videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos).
* It can help to plan out how your groups will be organized. Here's a [group access planning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FnguDXRUX9FGY14oV4Gx6O08v4vNC2Pv0GGCsU7Pxuw/edit?usp=sharing). The kinds of question you may want to answer are: How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? 

## User management terms and definitions [#definitions]

For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see [User management concepts](#understand-concepts). Here are some definitions for some of our user management terms:

* A New Relic **organization** is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see [Organization and account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).
* A **capability** is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions
* A **role** is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default [standard roles](#standard-roles) have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific [New Relic capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities).
* A user **group** has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have [default user groups](#default-groups) (**Admin** and **User**), and you can make your own groups.
* An [**authentication domain**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains) contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML.
* If a user is a [basic user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see [Basic user and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#user-type-groups-relation).
