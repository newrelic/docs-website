This doc applies to users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 
</Callout>

Here are some videos for helping you use the [User management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where). Note that some of these features [require a Pro or Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#requirements). Videos:
