Controlling who accesses specific data within your organization is vital for security, compliance, and data governance. While New Relic's [role-based access control](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts) manages what features users can access, <DNT>**data access control**</DNT> (also known as fine-grained access) manages what specific data users can view.

Currently, data access control is available for log data, allowing you to restrict user access to specific [log partitions](/docs/logs/ui-data/data-partitions/).

## How it works [#how-it-works]

For example, imagine you're part of a large organization generating massive volumes of logs across various teams, services, and environments. Your security team needs to monitor critical security logs that may contain personally identifiable information (PII), but your development teams only need to see logs relevant to their specific microservices. Data access control lets you create policies that define exactly which log partitions each team can access.

You create data access policies and assign them to user groups via access grants. Users in groups with assigned policies can only access the log partitions allowed by those policies.

Key concepts:

* **Data access policies**: Define which log partitions users can access using allow-lists or deny-lists
* **Policy assignment**: Policies are assigned to groups via the Access Management UI
* **Wildcard matching**: Use `%` as a wildcard to match multiple partitions (e.g., `log_prod%` matches all partitions starting with "log_prod")
* **Multiple policies**: When users belong to multiple groups with different policies, the most permissive access applies

<Callout variant="important">
Users with restricted access might still see information from restricted log partitions through [historical exports](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export/), [alert notifications](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/), or the [Insights API](/docs/apis/insights-apis/query-insights-event-data-api/). See [potential data exposure risks](#data-exposure-risks) for details and mitigations.

## Requirements [#requirements]

To create and manage data access policies:

* [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) account
* [Authentication domain manager](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings) role
* [Core user or full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) type

## Create and assign data access policies [#create-policies]

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create a policy [#create]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Access Management > Data access policies**.
2. Click **Create a policy** (or **Add a policy** if you have existing policies).
3. Enter a **Name** for the policy.
4. Select a condition:
   * **Deny selected**: Blocks access to selected log partitions
   * **Allow selected**: Allows access only to selected log partitions
5. From the **Log partitions** dropdown, select partitions to include in the policy. You can:
   * Start typing to filter the list
   * Use wildcard `%` to match multiple partitions (e.g., `log_go%`)
6. Click **Review policy** to verify your configuration.
7. Click **Create policy**.

The policy appears in the **Data access policies** tab. To view, edit, or delete it, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu.
</Step>

<Step>
### Assign the policy to a group [#assign]

1. Go to **Administration > Access Management > Grants**.
2. Find the grant you want to assign the policy to.
3. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu next to the grant.
4. Select **Add data access policy**.
5. From the **Policies** dropdown, select your policy.
6. Click **Save**.

The **Policy name** column shows the assigned policy. To remove or change it, use the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Multiple policies and access resolution [#multiple-policies]

When a user belongs to multiple groups with different data access policies:

### Most permissive access wins

If a user is in multiple groups with allow policies, they get access to all allowed partitions:

* **Group A**: Allow `log_frontend%`
* **Group B**: Allow `log_backend%`
* **Result**: User can access both frontend and backend log partitions

### Deny takes precedence

If any policy explicitly denies access, that denial takes precedence:

* **Group A**: Allow `log_%` (all partitions)
* **Group B**: Deny `log_sensitive`
* **Result**: User can access all partitions except `log_sensitive`

### Check user's policies

To see which policies apply to a user:

1. Go to **Administration > Access Management > Grants**
2. Find the user's groups
3. Check the **Policy name** column for each group

## Potential data exposure risks [#data-exposure-risks]

While data access control restricts log data access in most New Relic features, there are scenarios where users might still see restricted data:

<CollapserGroup>

<Collapser
  id="api-keys"
  title="Legacy Insights API keys"
>

**Risk**: Users with legacy Insights API keys can query restricted log partitions, as these keys don't follow data access policies.

**Mitigation**:

1. Go to your [API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/api-keys/home)
2. Identify legacy Insights API keys
3. Rotate or delete these keys
4. Create new [user keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key) that respect data access policies

</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="alerts"
  title="Alerts and notifications"
>

**Risks**:

* Users can target any alert condition in an account they access for notifications, including conditions on restricted partitions
* Users can add [notification enrichment](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) with queries targeting restricted partitions
* Users can query these events which may contain restricted data: `NrAiSignal`, `NrAiIncident`, `NrAiIssue`, `NrAiNotification`, `NrIntegrationError`
* Users can view condition detail pages and issue pages even when conditions query restricted partitions

**Mitigation**:

1. Create a [custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) without access to alerts and notification workflows
2. Assign it to users who shouldn't manage alerts
3. Avoid faceting on sensitive fields in alert conditions

## Manage via API [#api]

You can also manage data access policies using the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-data-access-control).

* [Manage users with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users)
* [Log partitions](/docs/logs/ui-data/data-partitions/)
* [Create alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/)
