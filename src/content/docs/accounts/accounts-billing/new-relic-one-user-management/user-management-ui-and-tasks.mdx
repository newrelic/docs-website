  This doc is about managing users who are on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).
</Callout>

This doc explains how to [find and use the user management UI](#where) and how to do some [common user management tasks](#workflow).

## User management UI [#where]

To find your New Relic organization's user management options: From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **Administration**. Here are the user management-related UI pages you can find there:

* **User management** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/users-list)): Use this to add users, update user type, manage users' groups, approve user upgrade requests, and control session settings.
* **Access management** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail)): Use this UI to view, create, and manage [groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts). 
* **API keys**: Use the [API keys UI](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys) to view and manage your users' API keys. 
* **Domain capture**: Use domain capture to route your users into the right place when they attempt to sign up for New Relic. [Learn more about domain capture.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/domain-capture)
* **Authentication domains** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/centralized-admin-user-auto-provisioning/home)): Use this to control how your users are added (from New Relic or from an identity provider), how they log in (manually or via SAML SSO), and more. For details, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

For tips on managing users, see [Common tasks](#workflow) and our [User management videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos).

## Requirements [#requirements]

The easiest way to see what your user management permissions are is to go to the [user management UI](#where) and see what you have access to.

Some user management requirements and restrictions:

* This doc explains how to manage users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).
* To add and edit groups and roles, your organization must have [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) edition.
* Permissions-related requirements:
  * Requires a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of core user or full platform user.
  * Most user management capabilities require the organization- and authentication domain-related [administration settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings). 
* To avoid configuration conflicts, try to ensure that only one person in your organization is managing users at a time.

## User management UI [#user-mgmt]

Here's a screenshot of the **User management** UI. We'll explain the column headers below. 

<img
  title="User management UI"
  alt="User management UI"
  src={accountsUserMgmtUi}
/>

* **Name**: The user's name. 
* **Email**: The user's email address. `Pending` indicates a user has been added to New Relic but has not yet logged in. `Pending` users are still considered provisioned: if they have a billable user type they are billable regardless of their New Relic activity. 
* **Type**: The user's [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 
* **Last active**: The last date a user was logged in to the platform. (This does **not** track use of our APIs that require a <InlinePopover type="userKey" />.) This can be useful for deciding to downgrade a user to a lower user type. 
* **ID**: A user's New Relic-assigned ID. 

There is an **Invites needing approval** tab on this page. These users are not yet considered provisioned and are not billable. For more on how inviting teammates works, see [Add users](#add-users).

## Tips on common user management tasks [#workflow]

Here are some user management tasks you might want to do:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="learn-about-users"
    title="Learn about users"
  >
  To learn about your users, go to the **User management UI** and examine specific users for details. You can also go to the **Access management** UI to examine groups: the roles those groups have, and the users in each group.

  To see all your users and their group memberships, you can [use NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups#query-user-groups).
</Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add users"
  >
There are a couple ways to add users: 

* **Add users**: Go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select **Add user**. Details on adding users: 
  * Adding users directly means users with a billable user type are immediately billable, even if they've never logged into New Relic and are `Pending`.
  * Added users receive a verification email, which expires after 15 days. To resend it: in the user management UI, hover over a user's `Pending` icon and click `Resend email`. 
* **Invite users**: Go to the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and click **Add user**. Details on inviting users: 
  * If you have [**Authentication domain** permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings), this takes you to the **Add users** UI, where you can add users directly. 
  * If you don't have that permission, you can invite a teammate. This requests review by an admin of that user being added to New Relic. Pending invites that haven't been reviewed are found on the **Invites needing approval** tab of the **User management** page. When an admin reviews an invited user, they complete the **Add user** workflow and that user is then considered provisioned in New Relic.  

Other notes for adding users: 

* You can also use [our NerdGraph API to add and manage users](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users).
* If you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you can only add users from your identity provider.

Before changing your users' user type, we recommend you understand:

* [How to decide on a user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#choose-user-type).
* [How users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing), including tips on how to time adding new users, or adjusting their user type.
* [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).
* Using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign)? You have [other options for managing user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).

To change the user type of users in the UI:

1. From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit.
2. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for **Edit type**.

You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user.

For how to use our API to manage user information, see [Manage users with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users).

    />

    To manage how users upgrade their user type, see the [authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).

    <Collapser
    id="delete-users"
    title="Delete users"
  >
  To delete users: go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select the checkboxes of one or more users. Then click **Delete users**.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="export-users"
    title="Export a spreadsheet of users"
  >
    To export a list of all users and their details (names, email addresses, current user type, groups, user ID): From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the download icon beside the **Add user** button. There's an option for downloading a list of all users in that authentication domain.

    Alternatively, to export a subset of users, first select the users you want to export, and then hit the download button.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Grant users ability to manage other users"
  >
    To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the [**Authentication domain settings**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings). The two main ways to accomplish this are:

    * From the [User management](#where) UI, you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which has those settings enabled. 

      OR
    * You can create a custom group and give it those settings. For a tutorial on common user management tasks, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
