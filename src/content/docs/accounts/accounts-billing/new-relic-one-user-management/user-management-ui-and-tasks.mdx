<Callout title="New user model">
  This doc is about managing users who are on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).
</Callout>

This doc explains how to [find and use the user management UI](#where) and how to do some [common user management tasks](#workflow).

## User management UI [#where]

For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), to find your user management options: From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Administration**. There are two user management UI pages there:

* **User management**: Use this to add users, update user type, manage what groups a user is assigned, and approve user upgrade requests. 
* **Access management**: Use this UI to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants. Use the authentication domain UI to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. 

For tips on using the UI, see [Common tasks](#workflow) and our [User management videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos).

## Requirements [#requirements]

The easiest way to see what your user management permissions are is to go to the [user management UI](#where) and see what you have access to.

Some user management requirements and restrictions:

* This doc describes how to manage users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).
* To manage groups, roles, and access grants, your organization must have [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) edition.
* Permissions-related requirements:
  * Requires a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of core user or full platform user.
  * Most user management capabilities require the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles) and some require the [**Organization manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles). For details, see [Roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles).
* To avoid configuration conflicts, try to ensure that only one person in your organization is managing users at a time.

## Common user management tasks [#workflow]

<figcaption>
  In the **Access management** UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain.

Here are some example user management procedures:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add users"
  >
  To add users: go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select **Add user**.

  Note: if you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you can only add users from your identity provider. 

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit-user-type"
    title="Edit users' user type"
  >
Before changing your users' user type, we recommend you understand:

* [How to decide a user's user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#choose-user-type)
* [How billable users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing)
* [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules)
* If you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you have [other options for managing user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).

To change the user type of one or more users:

1. From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit.
2. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for **Edit type**.

You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user.

    <img
      title="Edit user type in the UI"
      alt="New Relic user management UI - edit user type"
      src={userManagementEditUserType}
    />

    To manage how users upgrade their user type, see the [authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="bulk-edit-users"
    title="Bulk edit users"
  >
To edit settings for multiple users at a time:

1. Go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select the checkboxes for the users whose group or user type you want to edit. 
2. Editing options will appear at the top of the UI. 

Note: if you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), groups must be edited from your identity provider. 

  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="delete-users"
    title="Delete users"
  >
  To delete users: go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select the checkboxes of one or more users. Then click **Delete users**.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="export-users"
    title="Export a spreadsheet of users"
  >
    To export a list of all users and their details (names, email addresses, current user type, groups, user ID): From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the download icon beside the **Add user** button. There's an option for downloading a list of all users in that authentication domain.

    Alternatively, to export a subset of users, first select the users you want to export, and then hit the download button.

  <Collapser
    id="access-grants"
    title="Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants)"
  >
    See our [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-group"
    title="Create new custom groups and roles"
  >
    See the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-group"
    title="Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning"
  >
    See [Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Grant users ability to manage other users"
  >
    To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles).

    You have two options:

    * From the [User management](#where) UI, you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which includes that role.

      OR
    * You can create a custom group and assign it that role. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).

## Use our API [#api]

To use our API to manage accounts and users, see our [NerdGraph tutorials](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#tutorials).   

## Track changes [#track-changes]

To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).
