  This doc is about managing users who are on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).
</Callout>

This doc explains how to [find and use the user management UI](#where) and how to do some [common user management tasks](#workflow).

## User management UI [#where]

To find your New Relic organization's user management options: From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **Administration**. Here are the user management-related UI pages you can find there:

* **User management** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/users-list)): Use this to add users, update user type, manage users' groups, approve user upgrade requests, and control session settings.
* **Access management** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail)): Use this UI to view, create, and manage [groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts). 
* **API keys**: Use the [API keys UI](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys) to view and manage your users' API keys. 
* **Domain capture**: Use domain capture to route your users into the right place when they attempt to sign up for New Relic. [Learn more about domain capture.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/domain-capture)
* **Authentication domains** ([link to UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/centralized-admin-user-auto-provisioning/home)): Use this to control how your users are added (from New Relic or from an identity provider), how they log in (manually or via SAML SSO), and more. For details, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

For tips on managing users, see [Common tasks](#workflow) and our [User management videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos).

## Requirements [#requirements]

The easiest way to see what your user management permissions are is to go to the [user management UI](#where) and see what you have access to.

Some user management requirements and restrictions:

* This doc explains how to manage users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).
* To add and edit groups and roles, your organization must have [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) edition.
* Permissions-related requirements:
  * Requires a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of core user or full platform user.
  * Most user management capabilities require the organization- and authentication domain-related [administration settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings). 
* To avoid configuration conflicts, try to ensure that only one person in your organization is managing users at a time.


## User management UI [#user-mgmt]

Here's a screenshot of the **User management** UI. We'll explain the column headers below. 

<img
  title="User management UI"
  alt="User management UI"
  src={accountsUserMgmtUi}
/>

* **Name**: The user's name. 
* **Email**: The user's email address. Some notes on messages you may see present: 
  * `Pending`: This user is added to New Relic but hasn't yet logged in for the first time. Note that even in the `Pending` state, users are still considered provisioned: this means if they have a billable user type they are billable.
  * <img src={accountsPendingInviteApproval} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Pending invite approval icon" title="Pending invite approval icon" />  This icon indicates `Pending invite approval`. These users are not yet billable. For more on how inviting teammates works, see [Add users](#add-users).
* **Type**: The user's [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 
* **Groups**: The [groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts) that a user belongs to. 
* **Last active**: The last date a user was logged into New Relic. It does not track API activity performed with a user's user key. `Last active` can be useful for deciding to downgrade a user to a lower user type. 
* **ID**: A user's New Relic-assigned ID. 

## Tips on common user management tasks [#workflow]

Here are some user management tasks you might want to do:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add users"
  >
There are a couple ways to add users: 

* **Add users**: Go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select **Add user**. Note that adding users directly to New Relic means users with a billable user type are immediately billable, regardless of whether those users are `Pending` and haven't yet logged into New Relic.  
* **Invite users**: Go to the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and click **Add user**. Details on inviting users: 
  * If you have [**Authentication domain** permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings), this takes you to the **Add users** UI, where you can add users directly. 
  * If you don't have that permission, you can invite a teammate. This requests review by an admin of that user being added to New Relic. Pending invites that haven't been reviewed are marked as [`Pending invite approval` in the user management UI](#user-mgmt). When an admin reviews an invited user, they complete the **Add user** workflow and that user is considered added in New Relic.  

Other notes for adding users: 

* You can also use [our NerdGraph API to add and manage users](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users).
* If you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you can only add users from your identity provider. 

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit-user-type"
    title="Edit users' user type"
  >
Before changing your users' user type, we recommend you understand:

* [How to decide a user's user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#choose-user-type)
* [How billable users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing)
* [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules)
* If you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you have [other options for managing user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).

To change the user type of one or more users from the UI:

1. From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit.
2. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for **Edit type**.

You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user.

For how to use our API to manage user information, see [Manage users with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users).

    <img
      title="Edit user type in the UI"
      alt="New Relic user management UI - edit user type"
      src={accountsUserMgmtEditUsers}
    />

    To manage how users upgrade their user type, see the [authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#user-upgrade).
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="bulk-edit-users"
    title="Bulk edit users"
  >
To edit settings for multiple users at a time:

1. Go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select the checkboxes for the users whose group or user type you want to edit. 
2. Editing options will appear at the top of the UI. 

Note: if you're using [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), groups must be edited from your identity provider.

    <Collapser
    id="delete-users"
    title="Delete users"
  >
  To delete users: go to the [**User management** UI](#where) and select the checkboxes of one or more users. Then click **Delete users**.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="export-users"
    title="Export a spreadsheet of users"
  >
    To export a list of all users and their details (names, email addresses, current user type, groups, user ID): From the [**User management** UI](#where), click the download icon beside the **Add user** button. There's an option for downloading a list of all users in that authentication domain.

    Alternatively, to export a subset of users, first select the users you want to export, and then hit the download button.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Grant users ability to manage other users"
  >
    To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the [**Authentication domain settings**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings). The two main ways to accomplish this are:

    * From the [User management](#where) UI, you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which has those settings enabled. 

      OR
    * You can create a custom group and give it those settings. For a tutorial on common user management tasks, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
