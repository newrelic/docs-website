For users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles), we provide various user management features, including the ability to:

* Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups
* Create custom user groups
* Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model). Not sure which user model you're on? See [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).
</Callout>

## Requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  To quickly check if you can access these user management features, go to the [user management UI](#where) and see what you have access to.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* These features allow managing of users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models). To learn more, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate).
* To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that **only one user is managing users at a time**. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. 
* Most capabilities require the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) and some require the [**Organization manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles). For details, see [Standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles).
* Pricing edition requirements:
  * To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) edition is required.
  * To [import users from an identity provider](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso#source-users): [Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) is required.
* A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.  

## Manage users in the UI [#where]

For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), to find your user management options: From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Administration**. There are two user management UI pages there: 

* **User management**: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve [upgrade requests](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#session-mgmt).
* **Organization and access**: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you can't use or access these UI pages, it may be because your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model) or because you don't have the [required user management role](#requirements).
</Callout>

## Overview of user management concepts [#understand-concepts]

To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the "access grant." An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant.

Note that if your organization is on Standard [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) and want to assign a user to a [default group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#groups) (**Admin** or **User**), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply [add a user](#add-users) to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant.

Some tips on setting up access grants: 

* It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? 
* For smaller, flatter organizations okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. 
* A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (**Organization manager**, **Authentication domain manager**, and **Billing user**) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like **All product admin**, **Standard user**, or custom roles). 


## User management definitions [#definitions]

Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other:

* A **capability** is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions
* A **role** is a set of capabilities. Our default [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities.
* A user **group** has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have [default user groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#group-roles) (**Admin** and **User**), and you can make your own groups.
* An **access grant** is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, "This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account." Adding a user to a group doesnâ€™t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant.
* An [**authentication domain**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains) contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML.
* If a user is a [basic user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see [Basic user and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type-roles).


## Example user management tasks [#workflow]

![New Relic One user management UI](./images/new-relic-one-user-mgmt.png "new-relic-one-user-mgmt.png")

<figcaption>
  In the **Organization and access** UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups.
</figcaption>

Here are some example user management procedures:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add and edit users"
  >
    To add or edit users, use the [User management](#where) UI.

    To add users there:

    1. If you have multiple [authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains), choose one from the authentication domain dropdown.
    2. Click **Add user**.
    3. Complete the process, including choosing [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) and [user group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-group).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-group"
    title="Create new groups and roles"
  >
    See our [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Grant users ability to manage other users"
  >
    To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles).

    <Callout variant="important">
      Users cannot have only [organization-scoped roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default **Admin** group).
    </Callout>

    You have two options:

    * From the [User management](#where) UI, you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which includes both of those roles.

      OR
    * You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the [Organization and access UI](#where):
      1. Select **Access grants**, and choose **To this organization**.
      2. Create an access grant that assigns the **Authentication domain manager** role to a custom group.
      3. From the [User management](#where) UI, add users to that group.

    To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see [Tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="basic-full-upgrade"
    title="Control how basic users upgrade to full users"
  >
    See the [authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/#session-mgmt).
  </Collapser>  
</CollapserGroup>
