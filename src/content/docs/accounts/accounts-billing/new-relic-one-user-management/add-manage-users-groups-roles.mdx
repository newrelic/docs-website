For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles), we provide various user management features, including the ability to:

* Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to users
* Create custom user groups
* Use groups to control what sets of users have access to

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model). Not sure which user model you're on? See [Overview of pricing and users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).

## Requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  To check if you can access user management features, you can go to the [user management UI](#where) and see if you can configure settings.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* These features allow managing of users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models). To learn more, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate).
* Pricing tier requirements:
  * To manage users, groups, roles, and access grants: [Pro or Enterprise tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) is required.
  * To [import users from an identity provider](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso#source-users): [Enterprise tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) is required
* Some capabilities require the [**Organization manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) and some require the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles).

## Basic user management concepts [#understand-concepts]

From the [user management UI](#where), you can assign your users to [default user groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups) (**Admin** and **User**), which have their own default roles and capabilities. Optionally, you can create your own custom groups and custom roles.

Here are some explanations of user management concepts and how they relate to each other:

* A **capability** is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities are:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions
* A **role** is a set of capabilities. Our default [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities.
* A user **group** has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have [default user groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#group-roles) (**Admin** and **User**), and you can make your own groups.
* An **access grant** is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, "This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account." Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant.
* An [**authentication domain**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains) contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML.
* If a user is a [basic user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see [Basic user and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type-roles).

## Tips for managing your users [#manage-users]

Here are some important user management tips:

* [Some basic users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#convert-users) are able to self-serve to immediately upgrade to be [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), which are billable users. This is possible so that if you have an incident, your team members are immediately able to work on a problem.
* A basic user always has the capabilities of a basic user, no more and no less. This is true even if a basic user is assigned to a group that has very limited capabilities. [Learn more about basic users and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type-roles).
* To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).
* A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.

## Manage users in the UI [#where]

There are two different UI locations for managing users:

* To add and update users: From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User management**. For more on the user structure and options, see [New Relic One users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles).
* To manage groups, roles, and access grants: From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Organization and access**.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you don't have access to user management UI, it may be because your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model) or because you don't have the [required user management role](#requirements).
</Callout>

For tips on specific tasks, see [Example workflows](#workflow).

## Example user management tasks [#workflow]

Here are some example user management procedures:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add users"
  >
    To add users, go to the [User management](#where) UI and do the following:

    1. If you have multiple [authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains), choose one from the authentication domain dropdown.
    2. Click **Add user**.
    3. Complete the process, including choosing [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) and [user group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-group).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-group"
    title="Create new groups and roles"
  >
    See our [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Give users ability to manage other users"
  >
    Here's an example of setting up users to have user management roles.

    You'll need to add users to a group that has one or both of the **Organization manager** and **Authentication domain manager** roles (see [role descriptions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles)). There are two options:

    * From the [User management](#where) UI, you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which includes those roles.

      OR
    * You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the [Organization and access UI](#where):
      1. Select **Access grants**, and choose **To this organization**.
      2. Create an access grant that assigns a user management role to a custom group.
      3. From the [User management](#where) UI, add users to that group.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
