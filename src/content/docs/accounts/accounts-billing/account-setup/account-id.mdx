Some New Relic procedures require use of your account ID (for example, some API calls). Your account ID is the ID number we assign to your New Relic account. Note that some New Relic organizations will contain multiple accounts.

Options for finding your account ID:

* If your organization has multiple accounts: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page to switch between accounts and see their IDs.
* There are other options, depending on which [account/user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on: 
  * Original user model: Click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Account settings**, and then click **API keys**. The account ID is displayed there.
  * New Relic One user model: Click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and then click **Administration**. Click **Organization and access** and then **Accounts** to see account IDs.

For more on how account access works, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/cross-account-features-security-new-relic-one).
