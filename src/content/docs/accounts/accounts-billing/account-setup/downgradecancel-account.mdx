Depending on your pricing edition and other factors, we offer various options for reducing data ingest, deleting or uninstalling an agent or integration, or downgrading or cancelling your [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) (your account or group of accounts).

## Reduce or stop data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data. 

For how to manage data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures:
* [Remove APM, browser, and mobile apps](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/)
* [Remove infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-agent/)
* For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can [search New Relic solutions here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

## Downgrade your edition [#downgrading]

There are two options for downgrading your [edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions), depending on whether you're pay-as-you-go or not: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="payg-downgrade"
    title="Pay-as-you-go organizations"
  >
To downgrade a Standard or Pro [pay-as-you-go](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) organization: 

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Manage your plan**. 
2. Click **Plans and pricing**. 
3. Under the **Free** pricing option, mouse over **Downgrade to free** and click the button that appears.
4. On the window that appears, scroll to the bottom and enter a reason for cancellation. 
5. Click the box noting that you agree to the terms of service. 
6. Click **Submit.**
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="contract-downgrade"
    title="Organizations with contracts"
  >
If you have a Pro or Enterprise edition with [a long-term contract](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) and wish to downgrade, talk to your New Relic account representative. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Delete organization or accounts [#cancel]

If you're seeking to delete one or more accounts in an organization, but keep your organization and one or more other accounts in it, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).

If you're seeking to delete your New Relic organization entirely, including any and all accounts within it, your organization must meet the following requirements:

* It has only one account, and one user.
  * If you have more than one account in your organization, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
  * If you have more than one user, you can delete users via the [User management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#delete-users) or via [Nerdgraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users/#delete-users).
* It's on our newer pricing model. 
  * Most organizations are, but if you're not sure, see [Pricing models](docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models/#determine-pricing) for how to determine that. If you're on the older pricing model, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
* It must not have an active paid subscription.
  * If you have an active paid subscription, see the section [Downgrade your edition](#downgrading) above in this document.

### To delete your organization, follow these steps:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration**.
2. Click **Access management**.
3. Click **Delete organization**. If you don't see that option, ensure you've met the requirements above. For additional help, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
