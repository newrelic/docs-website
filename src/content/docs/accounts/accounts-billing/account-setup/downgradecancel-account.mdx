Depending on your pricing edition and other factors, we offer various options for reducing data ingest, deleting or uninstalling an agent or integration, or downgrading or cancelling your [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) (your account or group of accounts).

## Reduce or stop data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data. 

For how to manage data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures:
* [Remove APM, browser, and mobile apps](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/)
* [Remove infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-agent/)
* For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can [search New Relic quickstarts here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

## Downgrade organization [#downgrading]

Options for downgrading your New Relic organization will differ depending on your pricing edition:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="downgrade-pro-enterprise"
    title="Pro or Enterprise edition downgrade"
  >
    To downgrade your Pro or Enterprise organization, contact your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="downgrade-standard"
    title="Standard edition downgrade"
  >
    Options for downgrading for Standard edition:

    * If you're being billed and want to downgrade: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Manage your plan**, and then click **Downgrade account**. Once you are downgraded, you’ll still be able to access New Relic via the login page.
    * If you're not being billed and haven't input your credit card, you don’t need to downgrade and can continue using New Relic at a free level.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Cancel organization [#cancel]

If you've accidentally signed up for New Relic and want to delete that account, see [Delete organization](#cancel-unused-org).

Other options for cancelling your organization depend on your pricing edition:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cancel-pro-enterprise"
    title="Pro or Enterprise edition cancel"
  >
    To cancel your Pro or Enterprise organization, contact your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-unused-org"
    title="Standard edition: cancel unused organization"
  >
If you've created a new New Relic organization that you don't need and haven't yet set up, and if it meets some requirements (below), you can delete that organization with these steps:

1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Administration**.
2. Then click **Access management**.
3. Click **Delete organization**. If you don't see that option, it's likely because you don't meet the requirements below. 

Requirements to be able to delete an organization:
* Organization has a single account, and a single user.
* The organization is on Standard edition and on the new [pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans)
* The user is on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-standard"
    title="Standard edition: cancel other organizations"
  >
    First consider [removing monitoring tools](#remove-tools) or [downgrading](#downgrade-standard). If you still have questions, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
