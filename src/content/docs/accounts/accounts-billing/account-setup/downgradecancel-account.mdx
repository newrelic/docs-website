Depending on your pricing edition and other factors, we offer various options for reducing data ingest, deleting or uninstalling an agent or integration, or downgrading or cancelling your [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) (your account or group of accounts).

## Reduce or stop data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data. 

For how to manage data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures:
* [Remove APM, browser, and mobile apps](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/)
* [Remove infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-agent/)
* For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can [search New Relic solutions here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

## Downgrade your edition [#downgrading]

Note that your [New Relic edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) applies to your entire [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

Options for downgrading New Relic: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="payg-downgrade"
    title="Pay-as-you-go organizations"
  >
To downgrade a Standard or Pro [pay-as-you-go](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) organization: 

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Manage your plan**. 
2. Click **Plan and pricing**. 
3. Under the **Free** pricing option, hover above the **Downgrade to free** text and 4. click on the button that appears.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="contract-downgrade"
    title="Organizations with contracts"
  >
If you have a Pro or Enterprise edition with [a long-term contract](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) and wish to downgrade, talk to your New Relic account representative. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Cancel organization [#cancel]

If you've accidentally signed up for New Relic and want to delete that account, see [Delete organization](#cancel-unused-org). 

Other options for cancelling your organization depend on your pricing edition:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cancel-pro-enterprise"
    title="Pro or Enterprise edition cancel"
  >
    To cancel your Pro or Enterprise organization, contact your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-unused-org"
    title="Standard edition: cancel unused organization"
  >
If you've created a New Relic organization that you don't need and haven't yet set up, and if it meets some requirements (below), you can delete that organization:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration**.
2. Then click **Access management**.
3. Click **Delete organization**. If you don't see that option, it's likely because you don't meet the requirements below. 

Requirements to be able to delete an organization:

* It has only one account, and one user.
* It's not on Pro or Enterprise edition. 

To prevent your users from creating unwanted New Relic accounts, see [domain capture](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/domain-capture).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-standard"
    title="Standard edition: cancel other organizations"
  >
    First consider [removing monitoring tools](#remove-tools) or [downgrading](#downgrade-standard). If you still have questions, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
