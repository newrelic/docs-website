Depending on your New Relic pricing tier and other factors, you have various options for downgrading or cancelling your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) (your group of related accounts).

## Reduce data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can uninstall and/or delete agents or other integrations. For details, see the documentation for the specific New Relic tool you're using: you can [search New Relic tools here](https://newrelic.com/integrations).

For more on controlling data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

## Downgrade organization [#downgrading]

Options for downgrading your New Relic organization will differ depending on your pricing tier:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="downgrade-pro-enterprise"
    title="Pro or Enterprise tier downgrade"
  >
    To downgrade your Pro or Enterprise tier account, contact your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="downgrade-standard"
    title="Standard tier downgrade"
  >
    Options for downgrading for Standard tier:

    * If you're being billed and want to downgrade: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Manage your plan**, and then click **Downgrade account**. Once you are downgraded, you’ll still be able to access New Relic via the login page.
    * If you're not being billed and haven't input your credit card, you don’t need to downgrade and can continue using New Relic at a free level.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Cancel organization [#cancel]

Options for cancelling your New Relic organization depend on your pricing tier:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cancel-pro-enterprise"
    title="Pro or Enterprise tier cancel"
  >
    To cancel your Pro or Enterprise tier account, contact your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-simple-org"
    title="Standard tier: cancel simple organization"
  >
    If you've created a new New Relic organization that you don't need, and if it meets some requirements (below), you can delete that organization with these steps: click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Organization and access**, and then click **Delete organization**.

    Requirements for being able to self-delete an organization:

    * Organization has a single account, and single user.
    * Was created after July 2020 (and hence is on the new [pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans) and the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models)).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cancel-standard"
    title="Standard tier: cancel other organizations"
  >
    First consider [removing monitoring tools](#remove-tools) or [downgrading](#downgrade-standard). If you still have questions, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
