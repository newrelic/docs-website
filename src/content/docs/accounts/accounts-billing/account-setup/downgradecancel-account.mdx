Depending on your pricing edition and other factors, we offer various options for reducing data ingest, deleting or uninstalling an agent or integration, or downgrading or cancelling your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure).

## Reduce or stop data ingest [#remove-tools]

If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data.

For how to manage data ingest, see [Manage your data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures:

* [Remove <InlinePopover type="apm"/>, <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, and <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> apps](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/)
* [Remove infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-agent/)
* For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can [search New Relic solutions here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

## Downgrade your edition [#downgrading]

There are two options for downgrading your [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), depending on whether you're pay-as-you-go or not:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="payg-downgrade"
    title="Pay-as-you-go organizations"
  >
    To downgrade a Standard or Pro [pay-as-you-go](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) organization:

    1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT>.
    2. Click <DNT>**Plans and pricing**</DNT>.
    3. Under the <DNT>**Free**</DNT> pricing option, mouse over <DNT>**Downgrade to free**</DNT> and click the button that appears.
    4. On the window that appears, scroll to the bottom and enter a reason for cancellation.
    5. Click the box noting that you agree to the terms of service.
    6. Click <DNT>**Submit.**</DNT>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

  >
    If you have a Pro or Enterprise edition with [a long-term contract](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) and wish to downgrade, talk to your New Relic account representative.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Cancel an account [#cancel-account]

If you have more than one account in your organization, and are not looking to close all of them at this time, you can cancel one or more accounts while keeping your organization.

When you cancel an account:

* It is disabled, but it's still present in your organization in **Accounts > Cancelled accounts**.
* Users, groups, and custom roles remain, but access grants that are assigned to that cancelled account lose all connections to the account. You should also remove any access grant associated with this account, otherwise users may see errors when they try to view it.
* Any API keys associated with a cancelled account become inactive and can't be reassigned to another account.

### Who can cancel an account [#who-cancel]

To cancel an account you must be a user who is:

* A full platform user.
* In a group that has the Organization [administrative setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).

### How to cancel an account [#how-to-cancel]

Make sure you're a user who can cancel an account, and then you can cancel an account through our UI or through our Nerdgraph API. 

**Cancel an account:**

1. To cancel an account through our UI:
   Navigate to **Administration** > **Access Management** > select the **Accounts Tab** > select the ellipsis to the right of the account you would like to cancel > select **cancel account**.

2. To cancel an account through our NerdGraph API:
   See the NerdGraph [tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph).

## Delete your organization [#delete-org]

Besides cancelling individual accounts, you can also delete your entire New Relic organization. This takes some preparation, so review the steps below.

### Preparation for deleting an organization [#preparation-org-delete]

Before trying to delete your organization, please confirm the following:

* Your organization only has one active account. If your organization has more than one active account:
  * Cancel additional accounts using our UI or [Nerdgraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph) (see [Cancel an account](#cancel-account)).
  * The last remaining active account will be your 'reporting account id' for your organization. This account will be automatically canceled when the organization is deleted.
* Your organization must have only one user remaining. 
  * If you have more than one user, you can delete users via the [User management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#delete-users) or via [Nerdgraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users/#delete-users).
* Your organization only has one authentication domain.
  * If your organization has more than one authentication domain, you can delete authentication domains [directly in the UI](https://support.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAXPh0000006Wd7OAE/delete-authentication-domains) or [with Nerdgraph](https://support.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAXPh000000664LOAQ/api-endpoint-to-delete-authentication-domains).
* Your organization is on our newer pricing model.
  * If you're not sure which model you're on, see [Pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models/#determine-pricing) for how to determine that.
  * If you're on the older pricing model, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
* Your organization must be on the Free edition. 
  * If you have an active paid subscription, see the [Downgrade your edition](#downgrading) section of this document.

### How to delete your organization [#how-to-delete-org]

If you meet the [requirements](#delete-org) for deleting your organization, complete these steps:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>.
2. Click <DNT>**Access management**</DNT>.
3. Click <DNT>**Delete organization**</DNT>. If you don't see that option, ensure you've met the requirements above. For additional help, contact [support](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/find-help-use-support-portal).
