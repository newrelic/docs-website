As a New Relic user, you may have more than one user record using the same email address. This would be the case if you had: 

* Access to more than one [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure)
* Access to more than one [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) in a New Relic organization 

## Switch between user records [#switch]

When you log in to New Relic, you can go to the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) to switch to other user records that have the same email address. When you choose a user record from the menu, you'll be prompted to log in for that user record (either directly to New Relic or via your identity provider).

To access user records that have a different email address, you must log out and log back in.

## "Multiple logins found" message [#login-message]

If your email is associated with multiple user records, you'll see a `Multiple logins found` message upon logging in, and you'll be asked to verify your email. This might happen if you have access to multiple New Relic organizations, or to multiple [authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) in an organization.

When a user record is marked as `Original` on the login page, as shown above, that means that user record is on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models). 

Verifying your email address will allow you to choose which user record to access. If you don't verify your email address, New Relic will try to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address.

To avoid having to verify your email for each login, click the **Remember me** checkbox on the login screen.

For more on login issues, see [Troubleshoot login issues](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems).

## Delete user records [#delete]

If you've accidentally signed up for New Relic, see [Delete an organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account/#cancel-unused-org).

If you want to remove a user record, use the [user management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks).
