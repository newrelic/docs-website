There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization:

* Email and password: The default login method, which requires a user's email address and a password.
* Social login: You can use Google, Google Workplace, GitHub, and Bitbucket to sign up for and log into New Relic.
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).

Having trouble logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/).
