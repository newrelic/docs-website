There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization: 

* Email and password: The default login method. This involves inputting your email address and a password.
* Google and Google Workplace accounts: Can be used to login even if you have an existing user account with email address and password.
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim). 

Having trouble logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/).

For managing how your users log in, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

## How users are tracked in an organization [#email]

A [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) can have multiple accounts, and can assign users to one or more accounts with our [user management solutions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users). We track users by email address, so if you add a user to multiple accounts, as long as those user records have the same email address, they're treated as a single user. For more on this, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

## Switch between user records [#switch]

For users with access to more than one user record, see [Switch between user records](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found).
