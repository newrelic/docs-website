Minimum <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent version required:

* [Go 2.0.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes) or higher
* [Java 4.0.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes) or higher

* [Ruby 5.0.0.342](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes) or higher

## Regions and availability [#regions-availability]

Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an organization with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You are solely responsible for the selection of the appropriate processing and storage region based on any data localization or data sovereignty laws, regulations, and any other third-party legal requirements applicable to you.

New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region.

<DNT>**Exceptions:**</DNT> The following are <DNT>**not supported**</DNT> with an EU region account:

* APM's [weekly performance reports](/docs/apm/reports/other-performance-analysis/weekly-performance-report) are not available.
* Deprecated products and features are not available.

[New Relic's incident intelligence](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/get-started-incident-intelligence) service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or New Relic's EU region data center, by using New Relic incident intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region.

## Data costs [#data-costs]

Costs for data ingest are dependent on your data center region. For details, see [the list price table](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions/#list-price).

## Cross-region accounts [#account-structure]

When you sign up for New Relic, a [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) is created. This is what contains all your accounts and data. When creating an organization, you must specify the data center region.
By default, a New Relic organization and its accounts can only be in a single data center region. However, some customers with [partnership account structures](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions#partnerships) can have accounts in both regions. Some details for customers with accounts in both regions:

* Prior to October, 2022, organizations with accounts in both regions were only billed for the usage from US region accounts. Starting in mid October, 2022, these organizations will be billed for usage in both regions. The usage UI doesn't show data ingest from across data center regions: it shows only the ingest for the current account you're in and any of its [child accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure).
* The top-level account for your entire partnership organization resides in a single region. When you view the usage for that account, you'll see only the data usage from the accounts in that region. To view usage for the other data center region, switch to any [parent accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure) in the other region and view the usage UI for those accounts.

## Create an EU region organization [#create-eu-account]

To create a New Relic organization in the EU region:

1. Go to the New Relic [signup page](https://newrelic.com/signup/).

   OR

   If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly.
2. Follow the online steps to create your account.
3. From the <DNT>**Select your region**</DNT> dropdown, select <DNT>**European Union**</DNT>.
4. Agree to the [Terms of Service](https://newrelic.com/terms "Link opens in a new window").
5. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then [install](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent) or [update to](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent) the most recent agent version.

## API endpoints for EU region accounts [#endpoints]

## Access New Relic [#access]

If your New Relic organization reports data to the [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center), use the following link to go to New Relic: <DNT>**[one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com)**</DNT>.

## Billing and pricing [#billing-pricing]

New Relic's [account billing process and pricing options](/docs/accounts/accounts/subscription-pricing/account-pricing-billing-options) are the same for both the EU and US regions.

## Operational access and processing [#data-retention]

[Customer Data](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions#customer-data) is hosted in the region selected during [account creation](#create-eu-account). [Systems Operations Data](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/services-notices) is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region.

New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body.

Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in [partnership accounts](#global-account-hierarchy).

## Verify your account is based in EU region [#verifying-account]

Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center:

* In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with `rpm.eu.newrelic.com/`, it is an EU-based account.
* Check your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>. If it begins with `EU`, it is an EU-based account.
