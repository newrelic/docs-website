Sometimes your users will accidentally sign up for New Relic, creating an unnecessary and unwanted [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). This can result in some confusion and the need to delete the unwanted New Relic organization.

With our <DNT>**domain capture**</DNT> feature, we can verify your domains. When you enable that, users with email addresses from your domain who attempt to sign up for New Relic are given the option to join your New Relic organization. You can also control how those users are routed into New Relic (for example, the user type and user group they'll be assigned). The larger your organization is, the more useful domain capture will be.

## Requirements [#requirements]

* An organization must be on Pro or Enterprise edition
* Users using Google authentication can't be captured at this time
* Configuring this requires the <DNT>**Organization settings**</DNT> [admin setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings)

## How to set up domain capture [#setup]

To set up domain capture:

* From the [<DNT>**Administration**</DNT> UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#where), click <DNT>**Domain management**</DNT>.
* Click <DNT>**Add domain**</DNT> and complete the steps.

As part of this process, we provide you with a TXT record that you must add to your DNS records. Be sure you keep that TXT record in your DNS records because we periodically check for that record.

When you're done, the <DNT>**Domain management**</DNT> UI page will show the [status](#status) for that domain as <DNT>**Pending**</DNT>. When we've verified that domain, its status will be <DNT>**Verified**</DNT>.

How long it takes for the TXT to be added to your domain will vary. Once the TXT record is present on your domain, we'll verify it shortly after. If verification isn't happening and you think it should be, you might use a third party domain record-checking tool to verify the TXT record is present.

When domain capture is first set up, it's disabled. For how to enable domain capture and adjust other settings, see [User settings](#user-settings).

## User settings [#user-settings]

To configure your domain capture settings:

* On the <DNT>**Domain management**</DNT> UI page, for the domain you want to configure, select its `...` icon.
* Select <DNT>**Configure domain capture**</DNT>.

When a domain capture is first set up and still in `Pending` state, it's disabled, corresponding to <DNT>**New user access**</DNT> being set to <DNT>**None**</DNT>. The options for <DNT>**New user access**</DNT> include:

* <DNT>**None**</DNT>: Domain capture is disabled but your users see a note that a New Relic organization already exists for that email domain.
* <DNT>**New users can join this account**</DNT>: Your users are given access to join, on their own (after our usual email verification process).
* <DNT>**New users can request access**</DNT>: Your users can request access, and your admins will receive a request that they can approve or deny.

You can also control how your users are provisioned in New Relic, including:

* The [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) users are added to
* The [group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#groups) users are added to
* Their [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)
* An optional message for them

## Domain status [#status]

On the <DNT>**Domain management**</DNT> UI page, a domain can have one of several statuses:

* <DNT>**Pending**</DNT>: You've created a domain capture entry and we're attempting domain verification.
* <DNT>**Verified**</DNT>: We've verified your domain.
* <DNT>**Expired**</DNT>: Can be either:
  * The verification process has timed out after 30 days.
  * The TXT record was no longer detected on a domain.
* <DNT>**Transferred**</DNT>: Another New Relic organization has set up domain capture for that domain.
