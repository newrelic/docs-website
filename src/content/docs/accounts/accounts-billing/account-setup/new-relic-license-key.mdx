Your New Relic license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string created when you [sign up](/docs/subscriptions/creating-your-new-relic-account) for a New Relic account. It's used to determine the account to which you send your APM and infrastructure data, and some New Relic features will require you to input it.

## View and manage your license key [#finding]

You can view the license key for your New Relic account in the [API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**.
2. Select **API keys** from the options at the side of the page.

You can also get to the **API keys** page by navigating directly to [https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

From there, you can view and manage your license key as well as other [types of API keys](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys).

You can also [create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-personal-api-keys).

## Keep your license key safe [#license-key-security]

Your license key uniquely identifies your account and the data it reports to New Relic. Given its importance, **you should treat it like a password**.

If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult.
