Your New Relic license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string created when you [sign up](/docs/subscriptions/creating-your-new-relic-account) for a New Relic account. It's used to determine which account to send your APM and Infrastructure data to (Mobile and Browser use [other keys](#other-keys)) and some New Relic features will require you to input it.

## View and manage your license key

To view the license key for your New Relic account:

1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Account settings**.
2. The license key is on the right side of that page.

You can [create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-personal-api-keys).

  Starting December 2019, the license key is a 40-character long string ending in `NRAL`.

## Keep your license key safe

Your license key uniquely identifies your account and the data it reports to New Relic. Given its importance, **you should treat it like a password**.

If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult.

Ideas for keeping your license key secure:

* Store your license key in an environment variable instead of hardcoding it in configuration files.
* Scan your code for license keys on a regular basis, using tools like [Git Secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog).
* Use a secret sharing tool, like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) or [CyberArk](https://www.cyberark.com/).

## Other keys

Some other products have their own license key:

* [Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/copy-browser-monitoring-license-key-app-id)
* [Mobile](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/viewing-your-application-token)

## Heroku users

If you have a Heroku application, you can view your New Relic license key:

1. Log in to your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com).
2. Select your app, then select **Add-ons > New Relic APM**.
3. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) in the New Relic UI, select **Account settings**.
4. From the **Account information** section, copy your license key.
