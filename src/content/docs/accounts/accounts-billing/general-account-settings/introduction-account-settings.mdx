To view and edit account-related and user-management-related settings, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and in the top right corner, select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown). 

Keep reading for tips on how to find different kinds of account settings in the UI. 

## Pricing, billing, and usage UI [#pricing]

Note that [user permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/) may impact your access to some account settings. 

To find billing-related UI, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and, in the upper right corner, click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown) to access various account settings. Here's what you can find there: 

* **Manage your plan**: Options for viewing and managing billing-related settings. 
* **Manage your data**: Options for managing ingest of data, which can be a billing factor. [Learn more about managing data.](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic)
* **View your usage**: View of your billing-related usage. 
* **Administration**: Options related to billing, usage, and [user management](#manage-users) (this UI available only for users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models)). 
* **Account settings**: Options related to subscription and usage, and [user management](#manage-users) (this UI available only to users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models)).

## Manage users [#manage-users]

How you manage users depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on:

* New Relic One user model: see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where).
* Original user model: from [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Account settings**, and then click **Users and roles**. For more on user management, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/).
