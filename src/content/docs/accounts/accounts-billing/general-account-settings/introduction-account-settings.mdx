To view and edit account-related settings, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and in the top right corner, select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown). 

Keep reading for tips on how to find different kinds of account settings in the UI. 

## Pricing and billing settings [#pricing]

To view and edit some billing-related settings, you must be a [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type). Basic users have some restrictions.

How you access billing-related UI depends on which [pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans) your New Relic account is on: 

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser className="freq-link" id="new-relic-one-pricing" title="New Relic One pricing UI">

View and manage billing information based on your [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models):

* New Relic One user model: click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Administration**, and click **Plan and usage**. From there, you can view your usage data, and view and edit billing information. The ability to manage billing requires the [**Billing user** role](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#roles), which is included in the default **Admin** group. 
* Original user model: click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and click **Account settings**. Billing management requires an [Owner or Admin role](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#roles).

If your account is on the [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#pricing-plans), to view and edit billing details: 

1. Click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), and click **Account settings**. On the right, there are details about your subscription. 
2. For more about your subscription, click **Subscription**. To view and edit billing details, click **Billing**.

## Manage users [#manage-users]

How you manage users depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) your users are on:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser className="freq-link" id="new-relic-one-user-model" title="New Relic One user model">

For managing users on the New Relic One user model, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where).

</Collapser>

<Collapser className="freq-link" id="original-user-model" title="Original user model">

To manage users on the original user model: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Account settings** and then click **Users and roles**. 

For more on managing these users, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/).

## Add accounts 

How you add accounts depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on. This is because the user model has impacts on account structure and management.
