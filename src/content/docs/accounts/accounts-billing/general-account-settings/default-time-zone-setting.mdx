Your personal time zone setting controls most time-related settings in the New Relic UI, with a few exceptions. 

## Change your default time zone [#exceptions]

To change your default time zone for your New Relic account:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. Select the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), then select **User preferences**.
3. Change your time zone. 
4. Optional: If you're a user managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you're able to toggle using your identity provider's time zone. 

When you change your time zone, this can take up to 24 hours to be reflected in the UI.

## Exceptions where your time zone doesn't apply [#exceptions]

Some New Relic features do not rely on the **User preferences** time zone settings. The following use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and aren't affected by user preferences:

* [Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts)
* [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/specifying-time-range-v2#utc)

There may be other features where the time zone doesn't rely on your default time zone settings.
