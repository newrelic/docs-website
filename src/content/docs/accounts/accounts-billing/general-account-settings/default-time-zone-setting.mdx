Your personal time zone setting controls most time-related settings in the New Relic UI, with a few exceptions.

## Change your default time zone [#exceptions]

To change your default time zone for your New Relic account:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
2. Select the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), then select <DNT>**User preferences**</DNT>.
3. Change your time zone.
4. Optional: If you're a user managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), you can either use your identity provider's time zone or override that.

When you change your time zone, this can take up to 24 hours to be reflected in the UI.

## Exceptions where your time zone doesn't apply [#exceptions]

Some New Relic features do not rely on the <DNT>**User preferences**</DNT> time zone settings. The following use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and aren't affected by user preferences:

* [Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts)
* [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/specifying-time-range-v2#utc)

There may be other features where the time zone doesn't rely on your default time zone settings.
