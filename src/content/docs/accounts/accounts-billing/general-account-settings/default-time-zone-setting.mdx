Your personal timezone setting controls most time-related settings in the New Relic UI, with a few exceptions, as explained in this document. If you change your timezone setting, this may take up to 24 hours to be reflected in the UI.

## Change your default time zone [#exceptions]

To change your default time zone for your New Relic account:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. Select the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), then select **User preferences**.

## Exceptions [#exceptions]

Users managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) can't change their time zone in the UI. That must be configured in your identity provider.   

Some New Relic features do not rely on the **User preferences** time zone settings. The following use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and aren't affected by user preferences:

* [Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts)
* [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/specifying-time-range-v2#utc)

There may be other features where the time zone doesn't rely on your default time zone settings.
