In the bottom left of New Relic, you'll find your user menu, which gives you access to features related to managing your organization and users, managing your data, and more. 

## Find your account settings [#find]

The New Relic user menu. (If your user menu is different, it might be because of [permissions factors](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data) or because you're on our [older user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).)
