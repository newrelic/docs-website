There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data, including:

* [User permissions](#user-permissions)
* [Account access](#account-access)
* [Pricing plan/tier](#pricing)
* [Monitored entities](#monitored-entities)
* [Data retention](#data-retention)

## User permissions [#user-permissions]

User-related settings can impact what features or data you have access to. Potential impacts include: 

* Your [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) (basic user or full user).  
* Your assigned roles. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on.

## Account access [#account-access]

New Relic gives you a cross-account view of data from accounts within the same organization. But there can be boundaries between accounts that result in some data being obfuscated. For example, a user may see missing or obfuscated data if they don't have permissions for the account that data is coming from. For more on assigning permissions, see [User permissions](#user-permissions).

Some New Relic users have an email address associated with more than one New Relic account. This may result in you being in the “wrong” account and looking for data that isn’t there. For more on having multiple associated accounts, see [Login issues](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#verify-email).

Options for switching between accounts:

* Log out and log back in to a different account. If you're having trouble getting into an older account, see this [Explorers Hub post about multiple account access](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-so-youve-created-a-new-account-and-cant-seem-to-access-your-old-account/113122).
* Use the account switcher, located at the top of the New Relic UI, to switch to a different account.

* [Delete account created accidentally](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account#cancel-single-account)

## Pricing plan or tier [#pricing]

We have two pricing plans available, and this can impact feature availability. Pricing plans:

* Our original [product-based pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for.
* Our [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This newer pricing plan gives more cross-platform access. The main factors affecting access are your pricing tier and your [user type](/docs/users-roles#user-type).

Learn more about our [pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).

## The entities being monitored [#monitored-entities]

Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like:

* Additional UI components, and
* Data available for querying

For example, enabling [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) results in you seeing [trace data in the UI](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-trace-ui) and in having trace data available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

If you are missing data that you expect to see, see [Missing data](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

## Data retention

Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods. Once data has passed a given data retention point, it may be deleted or be aggregated for longer term storage. For details, see [Data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data).
