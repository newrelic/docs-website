A test of localization 02-04-2021

There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data, including:

- [Account access](#account-access)
- [User permissions](#user-permissions)
- [Pricing plan/tier](#pricing)
- [Monitored entities](#monitored-entities)
- [Data retention](#data-retention)

## Account access

New Relic One gives a cross-account view of data from accounts within the same organization. But there can be boundaries between accounts that result in some data being obfuscated. For example, in a master/sub-account account structure, a user on a sub-account may see data from the master account or from another sub-account that has been obfuscated.

Some New Relic users have an email address associated with more than one New Relic account. This may result in you being in the “wrong” account and looking for data that isn’t there.

Options for switching between accounts:

- Log out and log back in to a different account.
- Use the account switcher, located at the top of the New Relic UI, to switch to a different account.

- [Login and password troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/troubleshoot-password-email-address-login-problems)

## User permissions

User permissions can impact what features or data you have access to. For example, being an admin will give you access to administrative and configuration capabilities that non-admin users don’t have.

We have two different pricing plans, and each plan has their own user models and roles. To learn more:

- [Users on accounts with New Relic One pricing](/docs/users-roles)
- [Users on accounts with our original product-based pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/users-roles/users-original-user-model)

## Pricing plan or tier [#pricing]

We have two pricing plans available, and this can impact feature availability. Pricing plans:

- Our original [product-based pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for.
- Our [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This newer pricing plan gives more cross-platform access. The main factors affecting access are your pricing tier and your [user type](/docs/users-roles#user-type).

Learn more about our [pricing plan change](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).

## The entities being monitored [#monitored-entities]

Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like:

- Additional UI components, and
- Data available for querying

For example, enabling [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) results in you seeing [trace data in the UI](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-trace-ui) and in having trace data available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

If you are missing data that you expect to see, see [Missing data](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

## Data retention

Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods. Once data has passed a given data retention point, it may be deleted or be aggregated for longer term storage. For details, see [Data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data).
