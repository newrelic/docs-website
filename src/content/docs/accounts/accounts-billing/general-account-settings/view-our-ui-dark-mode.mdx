## Switch between light and dark mode [#dark-mode]

Currently dark mode is not supported in the Firefox browser. Otherwise, to view our UI in dark mode:

1. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown).
2. Click **Theme:** to select any of the following options:

   * **Theme: auto** (default): matches the UI with what you already have enabled with your OS.
   * **Theme: dark**: keeps the UI in dark mode.
   * **Theme: light**: keeps the UI in light mode.
