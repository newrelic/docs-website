This is a test

Some tips for understanding New Relic account/user structure:

- At the top level of New Relic's account hierarchy is the concept of the "organization." A New Relic customer's group of related accounts are considered to be inside a single "New Relic organization."
- For accounts with [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing):
  - The Standard [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for a single account per organization. The Pro and Enterprise pricing tiers allows [master/sub-account structures](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts) within an organization.
- New Relic offers you a view of data from across accounts in the same organization. For more details, see [Access to features and data](/docs/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).
- Some organizations can have [master/sub-account structures](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts).
- Billing-related usage is calculated at the level of the organization. This can mean that usage data may not display organization-level usage when viewed at a sub-account level.
