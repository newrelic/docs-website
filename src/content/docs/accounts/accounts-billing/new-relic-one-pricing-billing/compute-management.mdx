As a New Relic Admin, the <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt>  page shows exactly how your organization uses its Compute Consumption Units (CCUs). This guide shows you how to track, analyze, and manage your compute usage.


<Callout variant="tip">

  <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt> is available to all customers on New Relic Compute Public Preview or Core Compute plans within your New Relic account.

</Callout>

## Access Compute Management [#access-compute-management]
To open the <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt> page, navigate to **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal)** and select <dnt>Compute Management</dnt>.

## Break down your usage [#break-down-your-usage]

The <dnt>**Core capabilities**</dnt> tab provides details of your organization's core compute usage, and the <dnt>**Advanced capabilities**</dnt> tab provides details about your organization's advanced compute usage. Use the following controls to focus on specific entities and see their consumption.

* **Select a category**: From the dropdown menu, select **Accounts**, **Users**, or **Capabilities** to change the data in the corresponding table and chart that display the compute usage of the selected category.
* **Search for a specific entity**: Use the search field to find a particular account, user, or capability.
* **Filter to a specific entity**: Click the filter to select an account, user, or capability from a list.

Use the chart to visualize the compute usage by the selected entities for the last 30 days. You can group the data by daily, weekly, or monthly consumption. If you are adding it as a widget to a dashboard, we recommend selecting <dnt>**Auto**</dnt> grouping, as this allows the system to optimize the grouping to fit the dashboard time range.

To understand your overall consumption, the donut charts give a comprehensive view of the number and percentage of CCUs contributed by capabilities, users, and accounts over one month. These charts are unaffected by any filters you apply.

## Check your non-billable CCU usage [#check-your-non-billable-ccu-usage]

By default, the page displays only your billable CCU information. To check your non-billable CCU consumption from the last month, toggle on the <dnt>**Non-billable CCU**</dnt> switch.

## Manage and share your usage data [#manage-and-share-your-usage-data]

From the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu of each of the charts, you can:

* Add it to one of your [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/) for easy monitoring.
* [Set up an alert](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/) to notify you of significant changes in usage.
* [Share a real-time view](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#chart) of your data with stakeholders.
* Save the chart as an image for presentations or reports.
* Get the underlying query that powers the chart, which you can use for your own custom reports or deeper analysis.
