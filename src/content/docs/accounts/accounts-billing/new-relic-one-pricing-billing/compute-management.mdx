As a New Relic Admin, the <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt>  page shows exactly how your organization uses its Compute Consumption Units (CCUs). This guide shows you how to track, analyze, and manage your compute usage.


<Callout variant="tip">

  <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt> is available to all customers on [Advanced or Core Compute plans](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) within their New Relic account.

</Callout>

## Access Compute Management [#access-compute-management]
To open the <dnt>**Compute Management**</dnt> page, navigate to **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal)** and select <dnt>Compute Management</dnt>.

## Break down your usage [#break-down-your-usage]

The <dnt>**Core capabilities**</dnt> tab provides details of your organization's core compute usage, and the <dnt>**Advanced capabilities**</dnt> tab provides details about your organization's advanced compute usage. By default, the entire page displays data from the last 30 days, but you can change this to 60 or 90 days using the time selector in the top-right corner.

Within each tab, use the dynamic chart controls to focus on specific entities: select a category (Accounts, Users, or Capabilities) from the dropdown, search for specific entities, or apply filters to narrow your view.

<Callout variant="tip">
While you can group the dynamic chart data by daily, weekly, or monthly intervals, when adding it to a dashboard, select <dnt>**Auto**</dnt> grouping to let the system optimize the display based on the dashboard's time range.
</Callout>

To understand your overall consumption, the donut charts give a comprehensive view of the number and percentage of CCUs contributed by capabilities, users, and accounts over one month. These charts are unaffected by any filters you apply.

## Switch between billable and non-billable CCU views [#switch-between-billable-and-non-billable-ccu-views]

The page shows either billable or non-billable CCU information. By default, you'll see billable CCU data. To switch to non-billable CCU data, toggle on the <dnt>**Non-billable CCU**</dnt> switch.

## Manage and share your usage data [#manage-and-share-your-usage-data]

From the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu of each of the charts, you can:

* Add it to one of your [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/) for easy monitoring.
* [Set up an alert](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/) to notify you of significant changes in usage.
* [Share a real-time view](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashboards-externally/#chart) of your data with stakeholders.
* Save the chart as an image for presentations or reports.
* Get the underlying query that powers the chart, which you can use for your own custom reports or deeper analysis.
