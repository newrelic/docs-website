In addition to the primary billing factors of ingest and billable users, you can also use optional billable add-ons to enhance your experience with New Relic:

* <DNT>**Compute Add On**</DNT>: This add-on applies to usage-based billing for queries you run against interactive application security testing, live archives, and other add-ons as made available. It measures your usage based on [Compute Capacity Units (CCUs)](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions#compute-capacity-unit).
* <DNT>**EU Data Center for New Relic - Data, and New Relic - Data Plus**</DNT>: This add-on applies when you select the European Union as your data region, as available.
* <DNT>**Extended Retention for New Relic - Data, and New Relic - Data Plus**</DNT>: This add-on applies if you exceed the default length of time your data is retained. This applies to all your data—not just logs—and is a good option if you need to make a lot of small queries or make queries on large volumes of data.
* <DNT>**Live Archives**</DNT>: Extend your log storage duration by at least 90 days more than standard retention. This add-on is best if you need to keep logs that you'll query infrequently. Live archives also requires Compute Add On.
* <DNT>**New Relic Synthetic Checks**</DNT>: This add-on applies if your Checks exceed the default number of synthetic monitor checks.
* <DNT>**Vulnerability Management**</DNT>: This feature is included with Data Plus, but the add-on applies if you use the Vulnerability Management feature without Data Plus.

To get started with any of these optional add-ons, get in touch with your New Relic account team.
