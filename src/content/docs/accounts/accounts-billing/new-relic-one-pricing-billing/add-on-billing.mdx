In addition to the primary billing factors of GB Ingested and billable users, you can also use optional billable add-ons to extend your experience with New Relic. 

* **Advanced Compute (formerly Add-on Compute)**: This add-on applies to usage-based billing for actions you run related to Codestream, Live Archives, and other features as made available. You are measured and billed based on your usage of [Advanced CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).

  <Callout variant="tip"> 
    Your use of CodeStream under Advanced Compute will incur CCU charges, regardless of user type. This means that free basic users can access Advanced Compute features and incur charges for Advanced CCUs.

* **EU Data Center for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies to your data option (original Data or Data Plus) when you select the European Union as your data region, as available.
* **Extended Retention for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies if you exceed the default length of time your data is retained. This applies to all your data—not just logs—and is a good option if you need to make a lot of small queries or make queries on large volumes of data.
* **Live Archives**: Extend your log storage duration up to seven years. Live Archives also requires Advanced Compute.
* **New Relic Synthetic Checks**: This add-on applies if your Checks exceed the default number of synthetic monitor checks.
* **Vulnerability Management**: This feature is included with Data Plus, but the add-on applies if you use the Vulnerability Management feature without Data Plus.
