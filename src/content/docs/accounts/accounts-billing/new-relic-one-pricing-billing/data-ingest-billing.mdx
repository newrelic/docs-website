metaDescription: For New Relic One pricing, an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes. 
---

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the data ingested and stored to your New Relic organization is one billing factor.

## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option you have:

The Data Plus data option gives you a more powerful set of features and query limits, at a higher price point.

Data Plus requires an organization with:

* Pro or Enterprise edition, and
* The [core version of New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)

Data Plus features include access to: 

* Increased [query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries), upon enablement, of up to one trillion data points per 30 minutes and 100 billion data points per minute (compared to lower limits like 300 billion data points per 30 minutes and 10 billion data points per minute for our original data option).
* Increased [max query duration](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) of up to two minutes (compared to lower durations like 60 seconds for our original data option).
* Increased [data retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention) (up to 90 days). 
* [Log obfuscation](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui) capabilities.
* With [Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing): [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints) and [HIPAA](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic)-compliant data security, for eligible customers.
* Coming soon: enhanced streaming and historical data export, which allows you to export New Relic data to external destinations for historical analysis and modeling, long-term storage, and integration with other data analytics platforms.
* More features will be added over time.

For more details, including future features, see [the Data Plus announcement blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing). For an overview of our pricing options, see [the pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

Our original data option lacks the higher data limits and features that come with the [Data Plus option](#data-plus). 

For this data option, ingested data costs US$0.30 per GB of ingested data. Some organizations will have different data costs. If you're not sure about your data costs, see the [Usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

For questions about how to upgrade to Data Plus, talk to your account representative.

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

For the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), “ingested data” refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

Here are some notes about New Relic features and data that **do not** count towards ingest and billing:
* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) doesn't count towards billing.
* [Applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-applied-intelligence) data reported from third-party services counts towards billing but internally generated data (for example, `NrIncidentEvent` data) does not.
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) don't count towards billing. (For details about how those are defined, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)). 
* Usage-tracking data (for example, `NrUsage`, `NrMTDConsumption`, `NrConsumption`) doesn't count towards billing.
* Data related to organization and account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) doesn't count towards billing.

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

Other calculation details:

* In the context of New Relic One pricing, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.
