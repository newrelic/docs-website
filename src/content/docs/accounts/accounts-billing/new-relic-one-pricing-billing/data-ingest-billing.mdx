metaDescription: "For New Relic pricing, an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes."
---

For New Relic pricing, the data ingested by your New Relic organization is one billing factor. 

## Learn about costs [#costs]

If you're not yet a New Relic customer and are curious about costs, first see [our main pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). If you're an existing customer, keep reading to learn details about data ingest billing. 

## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find usage and billing information in the UI, see [Billing UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

For how to view and manage your data ingest, see [Manage ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option your organization has: **Data Plus** or our **Original Data** option. The Data Plus option offers advanced data capabilities for optimized performance, scale, security, and governance. A New Relic organization can have only one option at a time.

Here's a table with comparisons of the two options. Prices and limits are monthly, and prices are in USD.

To see a side-by-side comparison of Data Plus and our original data option, view [our Data Plus data sheet](https://newrelic.com/resources/datasheets/data-plus).

Interested in Data Plus? See [Upgrade to Data Plus](#upgrade-data-plus). 

### Azure Native New Relic Service details [#azure-native-data-plus]

With the [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native), you can collect and store your telemetry data for apps and infrastructure directly in Azure. This capability is included in Data Plus, but with these limitations:

* Available in the US data center region only
* FedRAMP Moderate/HIPAA eligibility not available
* Historical data export not available
* New Relic Vulnerability Management not available

## Upgrade to Data Plus [#upgrade-data-plus]

To upgrade to Data Plus, go to the [**Data retention** UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention) in the data management hub and click **Edit data retention**. If you meet the requirements and don't see the upgrade option, talk to your New Relic account representative.

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

In the context of the [New Relic pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), "ingested data" refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

In general, data that we generate to provide our features doesn't count towards your ingest. Examples of features and feature-related data that don't count towards ingest include: 
  * [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) and applied intelligence features. For example, `NrAiIncident`, an event used to generate these features, doesn't count towards ingest. 
  * Data created by aggregated raw data (for example, [aggregated infrastructure data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#infrastructure-data) or [dimensional metric data](/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#dimensional-metrics)). 
  * [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) (for more on golden metrics, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)).
  * Synthetic monitor checks. For details on synthetics billing, see [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits). 
  * Usage and billing tracking data (for example, `NrConsumption`).
  * Data related to account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`).

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui).

## Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your organization uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

## Free tier [#free-tier-limits]

For details about ingest for free tier organizations, see [Free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free).
