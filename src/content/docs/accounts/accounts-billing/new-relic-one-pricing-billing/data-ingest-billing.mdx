metaDescription: "For our usage-based pricing model: an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes."
---

For organizations on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the data ingested and stored to your New Relic organization is one billing factor.
 
## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option you have: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="data-plus"
    title="Data Plus"
  >

The Data Plus data option gives you a more powerful set of features and query limits. 

The cost for ingested Data Plus data above the free allowance of 100 GBs per month depends on your [data center region](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center):

* US: $0.50 per GB
* EU: $0.55 per GB

Data Plus requires an organization with:

* Pro or Enterprise edition, and
* The [core version of our usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)

To upgrade to Data Plus, you'll go to the [**Data retention** UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention#adjust-retention) and click **Edit data retention**. If you meet the requirements and don't see the upgrade option, talk to your New Relic account representative. 

Data Plus features include the following. Limitations of the [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native) are below this list. 

* Increased [query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries), upon enablement, of up to one trillion data points per 30 minutes and 100 billion data points per minute (compared to lower limits like 300 billion data points per 30 minutes for our original data option).
* Increased [max query duration](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) of two minutes for a regular query and 10 minutes for an [asynchronous query](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial). 
* Increased retention of several important data types ([learn more](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention)).
* Our [log obfuscation UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui).
* With [Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing): [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints) and [HIPAA](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic)-compliant data security, for eligible customers.
* [Historical data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export), which lets you run larger queries with no timeout.
* [Streaming data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export), which lets you stream ingested data to AWS Kinesis.
* [Vulnerability Management](/docs/vulnerability-management/overview). 
* More features will be added ([learn more](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing)).

For the [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native), these features are not yet available:

* Historical data export
* Streaming data export
* Vulnerability management
* FedRAMP and HIPAA-compliant data (due to Enterprise edition not yet being available)

To see a side-by-side comparison of Data Plus and our original data option, and to learn more about future features, see [our Data Plus blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing). For an overview of our pricing options, see [the pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

Our original data option lacks the higher performance and other features that come with the [Data Plus option](#data-plus). 

The cost for ingested data above the free allowance of 100 GBs per month depends on your [data center region](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center):

* US: $0.30 per GB
* EU: $0.35 per GB

If you're not sure what your data costs, see your invoices in the [**Manage your plan** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

For [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), “ingested data” refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

Here are some notes about New Relic features and data that **do not** count towards ingest and billing:
* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) doesn't count towards billing.
* [Applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-applied-intelligence) data reported from third-party services counts towards billing but internally generated data (for example, `NrIncidentEvent` data) does not.
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) don't count towards billing. (For details about how those are defined, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)). 
* Synthetic monitor checks don't count towards billable ingested data. For details on synthetics billing, see [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits). 
* Usage-tracking data (for example, `NrUsage`, `NrMTDConsumption`, `NrConsumption`) doesn't count towards billing.
* Data related to organization and account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) doesn't count towards billing.

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our usage-based pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

## Other usage-related billing factors [#other-factors]

Besides ingested data, there can be other platform-usage options that affect billing: 

* [Synthetics checks exceeding free amounts](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits)
* [Extended data retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention) 

## Related docs [#related-docs]

* For more on how data is ingested, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).
* For how to estimate data ingest and cost, see [Data ingest estimator](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost).
* For how to query usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

## Free tier data ingest limits [#free-tier-limits]

If your organization is on our [free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#free) and your data ingest exceeds 100 GBs in a calendar month, your data ingest is disabled until the beginning of the next month. Note that when ingest is disabled, the re-enabling of ingest at the start of the following month may take up to 24 hours.
