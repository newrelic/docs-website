For organizations on [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the data ingested and stored to your New Relic organization is one billing factor.

## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option you have:

The Data Plus data option gives you a more powerful set of features and query limits. The current promotional price is US$0.50 per GB of ingested data above the free allowance of 100 GBs of data per month. 

Data Plus requires an organization with:

* Pro or Enterprise edition, and
* The [core version of our usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)

Data Plus features include access to: 

* Increased [query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries), upon enablement, of up to one trillion data points per 30 minutes and 100 billion data points per minute (compared to lower limits like 300 billion data points per 30 minutes and 10 billion data points per minute for our original data option).
* Increased [max query duration](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) of up to two minutes (compared to lower durations like 60 seconds for our original data option).
* Increased retention of 98 days for several important data types ([learn more](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention)).
* Our [log obfuscation UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui).
* With [Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing): [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints) and [HIPAA](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic)-compliant data security, for eligible customers.
* More features are coming soon ([learn more](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing)).

Our original data option lacks the higher performance and other features that come with the [Data Plus option](#data-plus). 

For this data option, the cost is US$0.30 per GB of ingested data above the free allowance of 100 GBs per month (some organizations may have a different data cost). If you don't know what your data costs, see your invoices in the [**Manage your plan** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

For [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), “ingested data” refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

Here are some notes about New Relic features and data that **do not** count towards ingest and billing:
* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) doesn't count towards billing.
* [Applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-applied-intelligence) data reported from third-party services counts towards billing but internally generated data (for example, `NrIncidentEvent` data) does not.
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) don't count towards billing. (For details about how those are defined, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)). 
* Synthetic monitor checks don't count towards billing. The [monthly limit on synthetic checks](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits) is determined by your pricing edition.  
* Usage-tracking data (for example, `NrUsage`, `NrMTDConsumption`, `NrConsumption`) doesn't count towards billing.
* Data related to organization and account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) doesn't count towards billing.

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

Other calculation details:

* In the context of our usage-based pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.
