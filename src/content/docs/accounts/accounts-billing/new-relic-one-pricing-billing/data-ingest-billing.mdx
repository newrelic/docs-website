metaDescription: "For New Relic pricing, an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes."
---

For New Relic pricing, the data ingested by your New Relic organization is one billing factor. 

For an overview of our pricing, see [How pricing works](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing).

## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

For tips on understanding and managing your data ingest, see [Manage ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option you have: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="data-plus"
    title="Data Plus"
  >

The Data Plus data option gives you a more powerful set of features and query limits. 

The cost for ingested Data Plus data above the free allowance of 100 GBs per month depends on your [data center region](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center):

* US: $0.50 per GB
* EU: $0.55 per GB

Data Plus requires an organization with:

* Pro or Enterprise edition, and
* The [core version of our usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)

To upgrade to Data Plus, you'll go to the [**Data retention** UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention#adjust-retention) and click **Edit data retention**. If you meet the requirements and don't see the upgrade option, talk to your New Relic account representative. 

Here are details about Data Plus features and availability: 

* Increased [query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries), upon enablement, of up to one trillion data points per 30 minutes and 100 billion data points per minute (compared to lower limits like 300 billion data points per 30 minutes for our original data option).
* Increased [max query duration](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) of two minutes for a regular query and 10 minutes for an [asynchronous query](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial). 
* Increased retention of several important data types ([learn more](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention)).
* Our [log obfuscation UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui).
* [Streaming data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export), which lets you stream New Relic data to AWS Kinesis or Azure Event Hub.
* With [Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions): [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints) and [HIPAA](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic)-compliant data security, for eligible customers. (Enterprise edition not yet available for [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native).)
* [Historical data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export), which lets you run larger queries with no timeout. (Not yet available for [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native).)
* [Vulnerability Management](/docs/vulnerability-management/overview). (Not yet available for [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native).)
* More features will be added ([learn more](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing)).

To see a side-by-side comparison of Data Plus and our [original data option](#standard-data), see [our Data Plus blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/data-plus-pricing). For an overview of our pricing options, see [the pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

Our original data option lacks the higher performance and other features that come with the [Data Plus option](#data-plus). 

The cost for ingested data above the free allowance of 100 GBs per month depends on your [data center region](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center):

* US: $0.30 per GB
* EU: $0.35 per GB

If you're not sure what your data costs, see your invoices in the [**Manage your plan** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

In the context of the [New Relic pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), "ingested data" refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

In general, data that we generate to provide our features doesn't count towards your ingest. Examples of features and feature-related data that don't count towards ingest include: 
  * [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) and applied intelligence features. For example, `NrAiIncident`, an event used to generate these features, doesn't count towards ingest. 
  * [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) (for more on golden metrics, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)) 
  * Synthetic monitor checks. For details on synthetics billing, see [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits). 
  * Usage and billing tracking data (for example, `NrDailyUsage`).
  * Data related to account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) 

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

## Free tier [#free-tier-limits]

For details about ingest for free tier organizations, see [Free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free).
