To find billing-related UI, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and, in the upper right corner, click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown) to see various account settings. Here are some of the billing-related UI options you can find there: 

* **Manage your plan**: Options for viewing and managing billing-related settings. 
* **Manage your data**: Options for managing ingest of data, which can be a billing factor. [Learn more about managing data.](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic)
* **Administration**: UI related to billing, usage, and [user management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users) (this UI is displayed only for users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models)). 
* **View your usage**: View of your billing-related usage. If you don't see this in the main dropdown, you will find it under **Administration**.
* **Account settings**: Options related to subscription and usage, and [user management](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) (this UI is displayed only to users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models)).
