metaDescription: "For New Relic's usage-based pricing, an explanation of how billable users are calculated and rules for downgrading users."
---

For [our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the count of billable users is a billing factor. 

## What are billable users? [#billable-users]

Billable users are users with a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of either core user or full platform user. Basic users are free. 

Note that our [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) comes with one free full platform user.  

## View user count in the UI [#ui]

For how to view your billable user count in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Pricing versions: with and without core users [#pricing-versions]

We have two versions of our usage-based pricing model:

* **Our primary usage-based pricing version**, which includes core users. This was released January 12, 2022. This version gives you access to a third user type: the [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). It also has different [billing calculations](#user-count) and [user downgrade rules](#user-downgrade-rules).
* **The "without core users" version.** If your New Relic organization existed prior to January 12, 2022, and hasn't switched to the newer version, this is your version. Organizations on this version can add only basic users and full platform users; they don't have access to core users. This version will be increasingly deprecated over time as customers on this version switch to the core user version. See the [rules for this version](#non-core).

Tips for determining which version you're on:

* If your organization has core users or has the ability to add core users, you're on our primary version. If you can only add basic users and full platform users, you're on the "New Relic One without core users" version. You can view your users by going to the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#where).
* Another way to determine your version is by going to the [**Manage your plan** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui). If you see "New Relic One - Users", that means you're on the "New Relic One without core users" pricing version.

For more about the differences between these versions, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).

## Tiered pricing [#tiered-pricing]

Some Pro and Enterprise edition organizations have access to tiered pricing for billable users (full platform users). The prices and tier levels will vary depending on an organization's specific contract. Here's an example of how tiered pricing might work for an organization's full platform users:

* Users #1-10 at price x
* Users #11-20 at price y (lower than x)
* Users #21-30 at price z (lower than y)

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other, less expensive tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z. 

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative. 

## User calculation for the primary pricing version (with core users) [#user-count]

<Callout variant="important">
  These rules apply for organizations on our [primary pricing version](#pricing-versions) (the version with core users).
</Callout>

You can use the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) to get an overview of your billable user count. If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can also run [usage-related NRQL queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a **billable user type** of either full platform user or core user. A userâ€™s **billable user type** is defined as the highest user type at which a user was set during a calendar month. We use UTC timezone to define the start and end of a calendar month.

For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a calendar month, their billable user type for that month is "full platform user," and won't change, even if they downgrade later that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

If you're planning on adding billable users or changing your users' user type, you should keep these rules in mind. Some tips:

* If you want to add a billable user or upgrade a user, you might choose to do that at the beginning of the month.
* If you want to downgrade a user, you might choose to do that at the end of the month.

The count of your unique users is determined by email address. If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes those user records would count as a single user, and that user's billable user type would be their highest user type assigned during that month.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) or on any custom deals you have with New Relic.

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month.

## User downgrade rules for primary pricing version (with core users) [#user-downgrade-rules]

<Callout variant="important">
  This section applies only for organizations on the [our primary pricing version](#pricing-versions) (the version with core users).
</Callout>

The rules pertaining to how many times you can downgrade full platform users differ depending on your [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans):

    For the [pay-as-you-go usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans), there are no rules limiting the downgrading of users but the [billing impacts](#user-count) may impact when you decide to upgrade or downgrade users.

    Before upgrading or downgrading a user, ensure you understand the [billing impacts](#user-count).

    For the [annual pool of funds plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans), we have rules regarding how many times a user can be downgraded from being a full platform user to a lower user type. (There are no rules regarding how often users change between core user and basic user.)

    During a New Relic organization's contract year (defined below), if a full platform user is changed to a lower user type and back to a full platform user twice, that user will be billed as a full platform user for the remainder of that contract year, regardless of user type adjustments.

    A contract year is defined as a year starting at your contract's starting point, or at the anniversary of that point. If your organization started out on a different pricing plan and [switched to this version of pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release#nr1core-optin), the user type downgrade rule will apply from when you opted in until the renewal of your subscription term or, if applicable, the annual anniversary date of your commitment term, whichever is earlier.

## Rules for the pricing version without core users [#non-core]

The following rules apply only for organizations on the [version of pricing **without core users**](#pricing-versions):

* **How billable users are determined.** For a calendar month, an organization is billed based on a calculation of the number of full platform users for that month.
* **Prorating in first and last month.** The count of billable users is prorated based on when a New Relic organization starts their subscription, or based on when a user becomes a full platform user (added as a full platform user or converted to one).
* **Users are billable when provisioned.** A user counts as billable the moment they are set to a billable user type in New Relic. This applies regardless of whether that user has ever logged into or used New Relic.
* **User count based on email address.** If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes that would count as a single user.
* **Caveat for our original user model.** If your organization has users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): If a user is set as a basic user in one account in the organization and as a billable user in another account, the billable user status takes precedence.

For user downgrade rules, see below:

  <Collapser
    id="non-core-downgrade-rules"
    title="User downgrade rules"
  >
    The following user downgrade rules apply for organizations on the [pricing version without core users](#pricing-versions):

    User type is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. For that reason, a full platform user may only be downgraded a maximum of two times in a 12-month period. If a user's user type has changed more than this allowed number of changes, New Relic can charge that user as a full platform user.
