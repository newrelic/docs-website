On January 12, 2022, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type: [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 

## Overview of core users release [#overview]

On January 12, 2022, we released a version of our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a third user type: the [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and that changed [billing calculation rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

With this release, New Relic has two versions of the New Relic One pricing model: 

* Our primary New Relic One pricing version: this is the version with core users. It's available to new sign-ups and to other [eligible organizations](#availability).
* The "New Relic One without core users" version: organizations on this version can add only basic users and full platform users (not core users). This version will be increasingly deprecated over time. See the [relevant rules for this version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#non-core).

## Availability [#availability]

The core users release is currently available to: 
* New Relic organizations that were created on or after January 12, 2022. 
* Organizations that existed before that date that meet certain requirements. If it's available to your organization, you'll receive messaging about that, either via [opt-in messaging](#nr1core-optin) in your billing management UI, or from your New Relic account representative.

If your organization has core users or has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. If you don't, you're on the ["New Relic One without core users" version](#overview). For tips on determining which version you're on, see [Pricing versions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#pricing-versions).

## Benefits [#benefits]

Organizations with the core user version have access to three [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#user-type-defined): 

* Basic users
* Core users (the new one)
* Full platform users

Core users are a good choice for developers who write and ship code but who aren't responsible for managing uptime and reliability for production apps and systems. 

As a core user, you get access to the New Relic capabilities that [basic users have](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), plus a curated set of developer-friendly capabilities that help you understand issues related to your code, make data-informed development decisions, and collaborate with engineers throughout your organization. Core users can: 

* Use [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/new-relic-codestream-quick-start) to correlate performance issues with code in your IDE. 
* Use our [errors inbox feature](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to proactively view and manage errors from across your stack.
* Use our [log management UI](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management) to get deep visibility into application and infrastructure events. 
* Build and run [custom New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/build-custom-new-relic-one-application) and use [open source apps from our catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks). 
* Get more access to our GraphQL-format [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

For a detailed comparison of capabilities, see [the capabilities table](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#user-type-comparison-table). 

This pricing version also changes [how billable users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-calculation) and [rules on downgrading users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#downgrade-rules).

## Free access to core capabilities for basic users [#free-access]

For all New Relic organizations, all basic users will have free preview access to core user capabilities until February 28, 2022. Core user capabilities are described below. 

## Details on opting in to this pricing version [#nr1core-optin]

[Some New Relic organizations](#availability) that existed before January 12, 2022, have an option for opting in to the newer core user release via an acceptance form called the "core amendment." For some organizations, this acceptance process is in the UI, found on the **Manage your plan** UI page. The New Relic user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization.

When you accept the core amendment, your organization has a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won't affect billing. This gives you time to [decide which user type to assign your users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#choose-user-type). After the grace period ends, the new [billing calculation rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing) apply. 

When you accept the core amendment, you'll probably want to review your users and adjust their user types. How you do this will depend on which user model your users are on: 

* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#edit-user-type) 
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#update-user-type): Note that if you have multiple accounts, you can't see all users from across all accounts in one place. You must go into each account to see and manage that account's users. 

For tips on deciding what user type to pick for your users, see [User types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 

## Changes to how users are counted [#user-calculation]

The core user release has changed how billable users are calculated. For details, see [Billable user calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-count). 

## Changes to user downgrade rules [#downgrade-rules]

The core user release has changed the rules pertaining to downgrading users. For details, see [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules). 


## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

In November of 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
