On January 12, 2022, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type: the **core user** ([learn benefits](#benefits)).

## Who is this resource for? [#what-is-this]

This resource is a transition guide for New Relic One customers who are considering opting in to our new "New Relic One with core users" version of pricing and want to learn about the benefits and availability of this release.

If you're already on this pricing version, you're likely looking for our docs on [billable user calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing) and [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

## Overview of core users release [#overview]

On January 12, 2022, we released a version of our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a third user type (the [core user](#benefits)) and that changed [billing calculation rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

With this release, New Relic has two versions of the New Relic One pricing model:

* Our primary New Relic One pricing version: this is the version with core users. It's available to new sign-ups and to other [eligible organizations](#availability).
* The "New Relic One without core users" version: organizations on this version can add only basic users and full platform users (not core users). This version will be increasingly deprecated over time. See [this version's rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#non-core).

## Benefits [#benefits]

Organizations with the core user version have access to a third user type: the core user.

Core users are a good choice for developers who write and ship code but who aren't responsible for managing uptime and reliability for production apps and systems.

As a core user, you get access to the New Relic capabilities that [basic users have](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), plus a curated set of developer-friendly capabilities that help you understand issues related to your code, make data-informed development decisions, and collaborate with engineers throughout your organization. Core users can:

* Use [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/new-relic-codestream-quick-start) to correlate performance issues with code in your IDE.
* Use our [errors inbox feature](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to proactively view and manage errors from across your stack.
* Use our [log management UI](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management) to get deep visibility into application and infrastructure events.
* Build and run [custom New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/build-custom-new-relic-one-application) and use [open source apps from our catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks).
* Manage billing and manage other New Relic users.
* Get more access to our GraphQL-format [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

For more about the benefits of adding core users, see our [Core users blog post](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/core-user-usage-pricing).

For a detailed comparison of capabilities, see [the capabilities table](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#user-type-capabilities).

This pricing version also changes [how billable users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-calculation) and [rules on downgrading users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#downgrade-rules).

## Availability [#availability]

The core users release is currently available to:

* New Relic organizations that were created on or after January 12, 2022.
* Organizations that existed before that date that meet certain requirements. If it's available to your organization, we'll let you know, either via [opt-in messaging](#nr1core-optin) in your billing management UI, or from your New Relic account representative.

If your organization has core users or has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. If you don't, you're on the ["New Relic One without core users" version](#overview). For tips on determining which version you're on, see [Pricing versions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#pricing-versions).

## Details about switching to this pricing version [#nr1core-optin]

[Some New Relic organizations](#availability) that existed before January 12, 2022, have an option for opting in to the newer core user release via an acceptance form called the "core amendment." For some organizations, this acceptance process is in the UI, found on the **Manage your plan** UI page. The New Relic user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization.

## Considerations for adjusting users' user type [#changing-users]

If your organization is switching from our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing) to the core version of pricing (by accepting either the core amendment or the addition of core users to an existing [order](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#order)), you have a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won't affect billing. This gives you time to [decide how to edit your users' user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#choose-user-type). When the grace period ends, the new [billing calculation rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing) apply. The grace period only happens once for an organization: upon the transition from the original pricing model to the core version of pricing.

When you're ready to adjust your users' user type, how you do that depends on which user model your users are on ([learn about determining your user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models)):

* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#edit-user-type)
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#update-user-type): Note that if you have multiple accounts, you can't see all users from across all accounts in one place. You must go into each account to see and manage that account's users.

For tips on deciding what user type to make your users, see [User types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

## Changes to how users are counted [#user-calculation]

The core user release has changed how billable users are calculated. For details, see [Billable user calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-count).

## Changes to user downgrade rules [#downgrade-rules]

The core user release has changed the rules pertaining to downgrading users. For details, see [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

In November of 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
