## How the New Relic One pricing plan works [#how-pricing-works]

Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call **New Relic One pricing**. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to [transition to this pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-to-transition).

For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors:

* The amount of data [ingested](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks/). 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that.
* The number of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), who have access to our [more curated UI experiences](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-capabilities). [Basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) are free. 
  * The cost of each full user depends on your edition: [Standard, Pro, or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing). Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and [other features](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 
* For [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/pricing), our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.)

For a summary of what's included for free, see [Free edition](#free).

For an overview of pricing, see our [Pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Billing and usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see [Pricing and billing UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#new-relic-one-pricing).

If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also [run queries of your usage data and set up alerts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/queries-alerts).

## Billing calculation details [#calculation-details]

For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui). Here are some more details about how billing works:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="usage-calculation"
    title="Data usage calculation"
  >
    One [pricing](#how-pricing-works) factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the [usage UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    Other calculation details:

    * In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
    * Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.

    For more on how data is ingested, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

    For how to query usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="incident-events"
    title="Incident Intelligence events"
  >
One billing factor is how many [incident events](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#incident-event) your organization sends to [Incident Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence) for correlation and analysis.

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) doesn't have a free tier.) 

You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI:

* In the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#new-relic-one-pricing)
* From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Incident Intelligence**, and then click **System settings**. 

### Determine event source [#determine-source]

When you set up Incident Intelligence [data sources](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources), the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the **Sources** page: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Alerts & AI**, click **Incident Intelligence**, and then click **Sources**. 

### Stop reporting events [#stop-events]

Go to the Incident Intelligence **Sources** UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence.

    id="user-count"
    title="Full user count billing details"
  >
For accounts with [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), the monthly count of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. 

A user's [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: **a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period.** If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see [Tips on assigning user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#decide-user-type).

Here are more user-related billing details and caveats:
  * You can see your full user count [in the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
  * We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes.
  * The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user.
  * A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.  
  * For organizations on our original user model that have a [parent/child account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see [User count discrepancy](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#full-user-count). 
  * The [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. 
  * For organizations on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#user-type), because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user.

    For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month.

    For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill.

    For how to query user-related usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).

## Usage plan details [#usage-plans]

There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see [Usage plans](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plan-descriptions/usage-plan#pay-as-you-go).
* **Annual pool of funds**: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see [Usage plans](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plan-descriptions/usage-plan#annual-pool-of-funds).

For some frequently asked questions, see [Pricing FAQs](/docs/licenses/license-information/faq/frequently-asked-questions).

## Query and alert on usage data [#query-alert]

To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see [Query usage data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/queries-alerts).

## Free tier [#free]

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free:

* A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization).
* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type).
* Access to alerts and [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform/applied-intelligence) (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month).
