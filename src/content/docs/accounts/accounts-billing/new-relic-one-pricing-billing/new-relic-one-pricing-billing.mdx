New Relic has two primary billing factors: ingested data and billable users. In this doc, we'll explain how pricing works, what you get for free, and other details. 

<Callout variant="tip">
This doc is about our newer usage-based pricing model, and not our original pricing model. You're probably on our newer pricing model, but if you're not sure, see [Pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

## Where to start [#start]

If you're not yet a New Relic customer and are just getting started learning about our pricing, we recommend first reading our main [pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). For more in-depth details about how our billing works, keep reading this doc. 

## How our pricing works [#how-pricing-works]

Our usage-based pricing model is simple, which allows you to accurately predict your billing. It bills on these two primary factors:

* Your [ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). We bill on data ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You'll receive 100 GBs per month for free. The price per GB above the free level varies depending on which [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you have: Data Plus or original.
* Your [billable user count](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). Core users and full platform users are billable. Basic users are free. Your per-user cost depends on your pricing edition. Free tier and Standard edition get one free full platform user.

### Pricing editions [#editions]

Besides determining the cost of your billable users, the editions (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) gates access to different features and limits. For example, the editions have different limits for synthetic monitor checks. Also, Pro and Enterprise edition have several features not available on Standard, like FedRAMP- and HIPAA- compliant data. 

For more details on editions, see the [pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 

### Add-ons [#add-ons]

In addition to the primary billing factors mentioned above, there are several optional add-ons that are billable. These include: 

* Exceeding the [default number of synthetic monitor checks](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/monitor-limits)
* Exceeding the [default data retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention)

## What do you get for free? [#free]

If you're below the [free limits](#how-pricing-works), you can use New Relic free, forever. Here's a summary of what you get on the free tier:

* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month ([learn more about exceeding this limit](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#free-tier-limits)).
* One [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) 
* A single account in your New Relic organization (having [multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) requires [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)).

Here are some additional free tier limits: 

* [Synthetic monitor check limits](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits): 500 per month (compared to 10K for Standard)
* [Dimensional metric limits are lower](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes/#additional-considerations) than for Standard
* [SAP monitoring](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/sap-integration/#requirements) is not available 

## Free technical support for 60 days [#free-support]

Usually, technical support is not available on [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). But for a limited time, [technical support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/) is free for 60 days for Standard edition organizations when you input a credit card in the **Manage your plan** UI section.

## Data Plus [#data-plus]

On June 1, 2022, we released a more powerful data option called Data Plus. With Data Plus, you get many more features, and data costs more. For details, see [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).

## View usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), see [some considerations for managing billable users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#managing-billable-users).
</Callout>

## How data ingest is calculated [#usage-calculation]

See [Data ingest calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing).

Want to manage your data? See [Manage data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## How billable users are calculated [#user-count]

See [Billable user calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

## Billing schedule options [#usage-plans]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how your billing is scheduled and implemented. Here are the main options:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: With this option, billing happens at the end of each calendar month. There are no payment commitments past the current month and an organization can cancel at any time. An organization's first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from when their credit card information was input into New Relic.
* **Commitment contracts**: Commitment contract options include our Volume Plan, Savings Plan, and other options. With commitment contracts, an estimate of long-term expected usage is created and there's an agreed upon payment commitment. If an organization's usage exceeds that commitment, the excess usage is billed at the previously agreed-upon rates. These are available primarily to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations. 

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Understand order terms [#order]

Your order and the billing UI contain several details about your pricing plan. We'll examine some of the terms used to help you more easily understand it. 

Here's an example of a billable item found on a New Relic order: 

```
New Relic - Pro Full Platform Users (Volume)
```

Here's a breakdown of these terms: 

* The `New Relic` means you're on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). If this was `New Relic One`, that would indicate being on our original user billing version. 
*  The `Pro` means you're on the Pro [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#how-pricing-works). 
* The `Full Platform Users` means that this is a count of your billable full platform users. 
* The `Volume` means you're on our Volume Plan [billing schedule](#usage-plans).

For more details about your order and the terms used there, see our [license docs](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions).

## Tiered pricing [#tiered-pricing]

For Pro and Enterprise edition organizations with [contracts](#usage-plans): some of these organizations have access to tiered pricing for data and/or billable users. Tiered pricing means that higher levels of data ingest or billable users can unlock lower costs. The prices and tier levels will vary depending on an organization's specific contract. 

Here's an example of how tiered pricing might work for an organization that has tiered pricing for full platform users:

* Users #1-10 at price x
* Users #11-20 at price y (lower than x)
* Users #21-30 at price z (lower than y)

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other, less expensive tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z. 

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative. 

## Core user release [#core-acceptance]

In January of 2022, we released a third [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): the core user. New Relic organizations created after the core user release had access to that user type and the associated [changes to billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). Existing organizations had the option to enable core users by opting in via an acceptance form called the `core amendment`. For some organizations, this acceptance process is available in the UI, on the **Manage your plan** UI page. 

The user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. Note that opting in to this release puts your organization on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). 

When you're ready to adjust your users' user type, how you do that depends on which user model your users are on ([learn how to determine your user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models)):

* [Our newer user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#edit-user-type)
* [Our original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#update-user-type): Note that if you have multiple accounts, you can't see all users from across all accounts in one place. You must go into each account to see and manage that account's users.
