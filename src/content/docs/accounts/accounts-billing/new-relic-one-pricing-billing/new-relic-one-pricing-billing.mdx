This is an explanation of New Relic's usage-based pricing model (previously referred to as the New Relic One pricing model). This pricing model bills on usage: data ingest and your number of billable users.

<Callout variant="tip">
We have two pricing models. Not sure which model you're on? See [Overview of pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

## How our usage-based pricing works [#how-pricing-works]

Our usage-based pricing model is meant to be simple and to provide a lot of value even when you're [using New Relic for free](#free). Our pricing model bills on these factors:

* Your [ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). We bill on data ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You'll receive 100 GBs per month for free. The price per GB above the free level varies depending on which [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you have.
* Your [billable user count](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). Core users and full platform users are billable. Basic users are free. Your per-user cost depends on your [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise). Standard edition includes one free full platform user.

The different editions also give you access to different features. For example, each edition comes with a different monthly limit on synthetic monitor checks. For more detail about editions and more, see our [main pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## What can you get for free? [#free]

If your organization is on [our usage-based pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what you're able to get for free:

* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).
* A single account (you can have more than one account with [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)).

## Pricing plan options [#plan-variations]

Our usage-based pricing model has several variants that can affect your billing:

* **Core users**: On January 12, 2022, we released a new version of usage-based pricing with a new user type (the core user) and a different way of calculating billable users. For details, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).
* **Data Plus**: On June 1, 2022, we released a more powerful data option called Data Plus. For details, see [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).
* **Tiered pricing**: some organizations have access to tiered pricing for billable users. For details, see [Tiered pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#tiered-pricing). 

## View usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), see [some considerations for managing billable users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#managing-billable-users).

## Data ingest calculation [#usage-calculation]

Want to understand how data ingest is calculated? See [Data ingest calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing).

Want to manage your data? See [Manage data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## User count calculation [#user-count]

To learn how billable users are calculated, see [User count calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

## Billing scheduling options [#usage-plans]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how billing scheduling is handled. Here are the main options:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: With this option, billing happens at the end of each calendar month. There are no payment commitments past the current month and an organization can cancel at any time. An organization's first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from when their credit card information was input into New Relic.
* **Contracts**: Contract options include our **annual pool of funds** option. With contracts, an estimate of long-term expected usage (ingested data and billable users) is created and there's an agreed upon payment commitment. If an organization's usage exceeds that commitment, the excess usage is billed at the previously agreed-upon rates. These are available primarily to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations. 

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Announcement: removal of estimated cost in May of 2022 [#estimated-cost-removal]

In May of 2022, we removed the current month's estimated cost from the usage UI and from usage-related events. For details, see the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/org-user-mgmt-release-notes/org-users-22-05-01).
