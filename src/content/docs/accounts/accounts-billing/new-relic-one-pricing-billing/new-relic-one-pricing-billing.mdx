Whether you're thinking about using New Relic or are already sending telemetry to our platform, it's good for you to understand how the business side of New Relic works. 

We offer a variety of options in our pricing model, editions, and buying programs. To get acquainted with these three areas, take a look at the diagram and descriptions that follow.

## Pricing model [#pricing-model]

Our usage-based pricing model is composed of three factors that could affect your bill. Some factors are optional, so what you pay depends on which options you choose.

### Billing for data [#billing-for-data]

We bill for data by GB Ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You have access to 100 GB Ingested per month for free. The price per GB Ingested above the free level varies depending on which data option you have: Data Plus or Original Data. To learn more about how we bill for data, see [Data billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). To keep track of your GB Ingested, you can use our [Usage Summary](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-ui) page or [run queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

### Billing for user type [#billing-for-user-type]

We bill for certain user types. Core users and full platform users are billable, and basic users are free. The cost per full platform user depends on your edition. With our Free edition, you get one free full platform user. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  Your choice of edition will affect the cost per user type. 
</Callout>

To learn more about how we bill for users, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

### Billing for add-on features [#add-on-billing]

Selected features are available as optional add-ons. To learn more, see [Add-on billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing).


## Editions [#editions]

Editions are bundles of features that help you with administrative tasks, such as setting up users, getting support, and access to different data limits. Here are some comparisons to show what is included with each edition:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="free-edition"
        title="Free"
    >
      Here's what you get with the free edition:
      
      * Up to 100 GB Ingested per month
      * One [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and [unlimited basic and core users](docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)
      * A single account in your New Relic organization (adding [additional accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/) requires Pro or Enterprise edition)


      For the Free edition, if your data exceeds 100 GB Ingested in a calendar month, additional data is disabled until the next month. At the start of the next month, it may take up to 24 hours for data GB Ingested to start again.


      Here are some other limits that apply on the Free edition:
      * Lacks [ticketed technical support](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings/)
      * [Synthetic monitor check limits](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits/): 500 per month (compared to 10K for the paid standard edition)
      * [Dimensional metric limits are lower](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes/#additional-considerations) than for paid editions
      * For the alerting workflow feature, the [enrichment feature](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#enrichments) isn't available
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="standard-edition"
        title="Standard"
    >
      For small teams looking to get started with observability:
      * Ticketed support availability
      * 48-hour support response SLA
      * Limited to 5 full platform users
      * SAML single sign-on
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="pro-edition"
        title="Pro"
    >
      For teams with more than five engineers and complex workloads:
      * Access to enable as many full platform users as needed
      * Commitment contract (pay-as-you-go not available)
      * Two-hour critical initial support response SLA
      * Eligible for the Data Plus option
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="enterprise-edition"
        title="Enterprise"
    >
      For at-scale organizations with advanced security and support needs. This has everything in Pro plus:
      * FedRAMP and HIPAA eligibility with Data Plus
      * Receive Priority ticket routing
      * 1-hour critical initial support response SLA

    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Buying programs [#buying-programs]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how your billing is scheduled and implemented. Here are the main options:

* <DNT>**Pay-as-you-go**</DNT>: With this option, billing happens at the end of each calendar month. There are no payment commitments past the current month and an organization can cancel at any time. An organization's first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from when their credit card information was input into New Relic.
* <DNT>**Commitment contracts**</DNT>: Commitment contract options include our Volume Plan and our Savings Plan. With commitment contracts, an estimate of long-term expected usage is created and there's an agreed upon payment commitment. If an organization's usage exceeds that commitment, the excess usage is billed at the previously agreed-upon rates. These are available only to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations.

To understand our buying program terms, see [Usage Plan](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-usage-plan).

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Understand order terms [#order]

Your New Relic order and your invoice contain several details about your pricing plan. Here's an example of an item found on a New Relic order to help you better understand what those items mean:

```
New Relic Volume Plan - Pro Full Platform Users
```

Here's a breakdown of these terms:

* `New Relic`: This means you're on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). (If this is `New Relic One`, that means you're on our original user billing version.)
* `Volume Plan`: This means your organization is on our volume plan [buying program](#buying-programs).
* `Pro`: This refers to the Pro [pricing edition](#editions).
* `Full Platform Users`: This refers to the [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

Here's another example of an order item:

```
New Relic - Pro Full Platform Users (PAYG)
```

"PAYG" at the end means your organization is on our pay-as-you-go [buying program](#usage-plans).

For more details about order terms, see our [license docs](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions).

## Tiered pricing [#tiered-pricing]

For Pro and Enterprise edition organizations with [contracts](#buying-programs): Some of these organizations have access to tiered pricing for data and/or billable users. Tiered pricing means that Product usage will be charged for each unit within each Tier beginning at the initial Tier at its corresponding price. The prices and tier levels will vary depending on an organization's specific contract.

Here's an example of how tiered pricing might work for an organization that has tiered pricing for full platform users:

* Users #1-10 at price x
* Users #11-20 at price y 
* Users #21-30 at price z 

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z.

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative.

## Core user release [#core-acceptance]

In January of 2022, we released a third [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): the core user. New Relic organizations created after the core user release had access to that user type and the associated [changes to billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). Existing organizations had the option to enable core users by opting in via an acceptance form called the `core amendment`. For some organizations, this acceptance process is available on the <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT> UI page.

The user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. Note that opting in to this release puts your organization on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions).
