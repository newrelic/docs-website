This is an explanation of our usage-based pricing model (previously referred to as the New Relic One pricing model). This pricing model bills on usage: data ingest and your number of billable users.

<Callout variant="tip">
We have two pricing models. Not sure which model you're on? See [Overview of pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

## How our usage-based pricing works [#how-pricing-works]

Our usage-based pricing model is meant to be simple and to provide a lot of value even when you're [using New Relic for free](#free). Our pricing model bills on these factors:

* Your [ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). We bill on data ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You'll receive 100 GBs per month for free. The price per GB above the free level varies depending on which [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you have.
* Your [billable user count](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). Core users and full platform users are billable. Basic users are free. Your per-user cost depends on your pricing edition. Free tier and Standard edition get one free full platform user.

Our pricing editions (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) give you access to some different features and limits (for example, different limits for synthetic monitor checks, and access to FedRAMP- and HIPAA- compliant data). For more detail, see the [pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 

## What do you get for free? [#free]

If you're below the free limits, you can use New Relic free, forever. Here's a summary of what you get on the free tier:

* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month ([learn more about exceeding this limit](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#free-tier-limits)).
* One [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) 
* A single account in your New Relic organization (having [multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) requires [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)).

Here are some additional free tier limits: 

* [Synthetic monitor check limits](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits): 500 per month (compared to 10K for Standard)
* [Dimensional metric limits are lower](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes/#additional-considerations) than for Standard
* [SAP monitoring](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/sap-integration/#requirements) is not available 

## Free technical support for 60 days [#free-support]

Usually, technical support is not available on [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). But for a limited time, [technical support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/) is free for 60 days for Standard edition organizations when you input a credit card in the **Manage your plan** UI section.

## Pricing plan options [#plan-variations]

Our usage-based pricing model has several variants that can affect your billing:

* **Core users**: On January 12, 2022, we released a new version of usage-based pricing with a new user type (the core user) and a different way of calculating billable users. For details, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).
* **Data Plus**: On June 1, 2022, we released a more powerful data option called Data Plus. For details, see [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).
* **Tiered pricing**: Some organizations have access to tiered pricing for billable users. For details, see [Tiered pricing](#tiered-pricing). 

## View usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

  If you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), see [some considerations for managing billable users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#managing-billable-users).

## Data ingest calculation [#usage-calculation]

Want to understand how data ingest is calculated? See [Data ingest calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing).

Want to manage your data? See [Manage data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## User count calculation [#user-count]

To learn how billable users are calculated, see [User count calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

## Billing schedule options [#usage-plans]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how billing scheduling is handled. Here are the main options:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: With this option, billing happens at the end of each calendar month. There are no payment commitments past the current month and an organization can cancel at any time. An organization's first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from when their credit card information was input into New Relic.
* **Contracts**: Contract options include our **annual pool of funds** option, and other options. With contracts, an estimate of long-term expected usage (ingested data and billable users) is created and there's an agreed upon payment commitment. If an organization's usage exceeds that commitment, the excess usage is billed at the previously agreed-upon rates. These are available primarily to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations. 

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Tiered pricing [#tiered-pricing]

Some Pro and Enterprise edition organizations with [contracts](#usage-plans) have access to tiered pricing for data and/or billable users. The prices and tier levels will vary depending on an organization's specific contract. 

Here's an example of how tiered pricing might work for an organization that has tiered pricing for full platform users:

* Users #1-10 at price x
* Users #11-20 at price y (lower than x)
* Users #21-30 at price z (lower than y)

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other, less expensive tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z. 

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative. 

## Announcement: removal of estimated cost in May of 2022 [#estimated-cost-removal]

In May of 2022, we removed the current month's estimated cost from the usage UI and from usage-related events. For details, see the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/org-user-mgmt-release-notes/org-users-22-05-01).
