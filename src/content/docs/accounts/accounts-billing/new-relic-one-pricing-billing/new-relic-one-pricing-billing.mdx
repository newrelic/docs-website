An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing.

<Callout variant="important">
  This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan.

Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call **New Relic One pricing**. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to [transition to this pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-to-transition).

For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors:

* The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features ([learn more](https://newrelic.com/pricing)).
* The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that.
* The total number of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) (users with access to everything available at that tier). [Basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five.
* For [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/pricing), our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.)

For a summary of what's included for free, see [Free tier](#free).

## Billing and usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the [**Billing user**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#roles) role. For users on the original user model, this requires an [Owner or Admin role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#roles). 

For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see [Pricing and billing UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).

You can also [do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/queries-alerts).

## Billing calculation details [#calculation-details]

For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui). Here are some more details about how billing works:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="usage-calculation"
    title="Data usage calculation"
  >
    One [pricing](#how-pricing-works) factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the [usage UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    Other calculation details:

    * In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
    * Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.

    For more on how data is ingested, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

    For how to query usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).

  <Collapser
    id="user-count"
    title="Full user count billing details"
  >
For accounts with [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), the monthly count of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing tier and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. 

A user's [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: **a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period.** If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see [Tips on assigning user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#decide-user-type).

Other user-related billing details:
  * You can see your full user count [in the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
  * The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user.  
  * The [Standard tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. 
  * Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once.
  * For organizations on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#user-type), a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user.
  * For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization.

  For how to query usage data, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).

  For more on user capabilities, see [Users and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles).

    For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month.

    For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill.

    For how to query user-related usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).

## Free tier [#free]

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard tier gets access to for free:

* A single account (Pro and Enterprise tiers can have multiple accounts per organization).
* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type).
* Access to alerts and [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform/applied-intelligence) (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month).
