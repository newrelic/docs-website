Whether you're thinking about using New Relic or already using it, the following information is helpful to understand how New Relic prices products and bills for your usage.

To learn more, take a look at the billing options listed below and our [Pricing](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Pricing model [#pricing-model]

Our usage-based pricing model outlines the existing product capabilities and indicates which are available with the GB ingested, User, Core Compute, and Advanced Compute billing options. The following four factors could affect your bill and some of these are optional. So, what you pay depends on which capabilities you choose.

<Callout title="Note">
The [Core Compute](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) pricing model is currently in preview and serves as an alternative to our GB Ingested or User pricing models for some of the capabilities New Relic offers. If you are interested in trying out the Core Compute pricing model, please reach out to your account executive.

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="gb-ingested" title="GB ingested">
 A **GB ingested** refers to the amount of data ingested by New Relic, measured in gigabytes (GB). For the detailed information, refer to the definition of [GB Ingested](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#gb-ingested). We offer two options for GB Ingested as follows:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Original Data:</b> New Relic's Original Data option provides a default of at least 8 days of data retention and a maximum query limit of 20 billion data points per minute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data Plus:</b> The Data Plus option offers advanced capabilities like up to 90 days of extended data retention and an increased maximum query limit of 60 billion data points per minute.
  </li>
</ul>

We bill for data by the amount of GB Ingested, no matter the type, which makes your bill easy to understand. You have access to 100 GB ingested per month for free. To keep track of your GB ingested, you can use our [Usage Summary](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-ui) page or [run queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

### What counts as billable GB Ingested? [#usage-calculation]

In the context of the [New Relic pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), generally "ingested data" refers to the data stored in New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

In general, data that is utilized by our features doesn't count towards GB Ingested. Examples of features and feature-related data that don't count towards GB Ingested include:

* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow). For example, `NrAiIncident`, an event used to generate these features, doesn't count towards GB ingested.
* Data created by aggregated raw data (for example, [aggregated infrastructure data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#infrastructure-data) or [dimensional metric data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics)).
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) (for more on golden metrics, refer to [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)).
* Synthetic monitor checks. For details on synthetics billing,  [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits).
* Usage and billing tracking data (for example, `NrConsumption`).
* Data related to account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`).

### Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly GB ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your organization uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

<Collapser id="user" title="User">
 
 A user in New Relic is an individual who can access and use the platform. The count of billable users is a billing factor.

The billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative.

### Users: Billing and rules [#billable-users]

Users are billable the moment they're added as billable users to a New Relic organization. The following are the types of New Relic users:

* **Basic user:** As a basic user, you won't be charged, and you'll be able to set up our observability tools, run queries on data, and use custom dashboards (quickstart dashboards for up to 7 days). You'll also have access to some basic alerting features. However, you can't use our curated experiences, such as the APM UI, browser monitoring UI, or mobile UI. While your access doesn't incur a direct charge, you can drive billing for usage-based features, including the CCU add-on.

* **Core user:** As a Core user, you get all the basic user capabilities along with access to powerful developer-centric features like New Relic CodeStream, errors inbox, and our log management UI. If you have Advanced Compute enabled, your New Relic CodeStream use is also billed based on CCUs.

* **Full platform user:** As a Full platform user, you get access to many of our platform features. This includes our more curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors.

To learn more, refer to [User types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="user-count"
    title="How billable users are counted"
  >
    Billing for billable users is done per calendar month. To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the number of users during that month who had a <DNT>**billable user type**</DNT> of either full platform user or core user. A user's <DNT>**billable user type**</DNT> is defined as the highest user type at which a user was set during a calendar month. We use the UTC timezone to define the start and end of a calendar month.

    For example, if a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a calendar month, their billable user type for that month is `full platform user`, and won't change, even if they downgrade later in that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly. The change would be honored the following calendar month and that user will not be counted as a full platform user, unless subsequently changed again.

    If you're planning on adding billable users or changing your users' user type, you should keep these tips in mind:

    * If you want to add a billable user or upgrade a user, it's best to do that at the beginning of the month.
    * If you want to downgrade a user, you'll probably want to do that at the end of the month.
    * We use UTC time to determine the start and end of a month. This means that if, for example, you were on Pacific Time and you wanted to downgrade users on the last day of the month, you'd have to make those changes by 5pm Pacific Time.

Users in your organization with the same email address are only counted as one user. For more information, refer to [User tracking](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found#user-records) section of our docs.

If you are on our [newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models), users are billable when they're added by admins as billable users. Even if a billable user has never logged in to New Relic and has a `Pending invite` tag in the UI, they're still billable (If you are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model), `Pending invite` users are not billable).

For more on adding and inviting users, refer to the [Add users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#add-users) section of our docs.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization's [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), or on any custom pricing you might have with New Relic.

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, we'll prorate your billable user count based on your start date within that month. We'll also prorate your last month if you cancel your subscription.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="user-downgrade-rules"
    title="User downgrade rules"
  >
    The rules pertaining to how many times you can downgrade full platform users differ depending on whether your [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans) is pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or a committed contract.

    ### Pay-as-you-go downgrade rules

    For the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) usage plan, there are no rules limiting the downgrading of users. Note that the [billing calculation](#user-count) can impact your decisions of when to upgrade or downgrade users.

    ### Commitment contracts downgrade rules

    Before upgrading or downgrading a user, you should understand [how user billing works](#user-count).

    For organizations with committed contracts, the rule governing full platform user downgrades and upgrades is as following:

    <DNT>**If a full platform user is downgraded to a lower user type in a later month and then returned to a full platform user in a later month, and this downgrade/upgrade cycle happens twice in a contract year, that user will be billed as a full platform user for the remainder of the year, regardless of edits to their user type.**</DNT> There are no rules governing user type changes that happen within a month because of [how user billing works](#user-count): a user's billable user type for a calendar month is the highest user type they are set at during that month.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Manage users and costs [#manage]

To manage users, refer to the [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks) section in our docs. You can use the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) to get an overview of your billable user count. If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can also run [usage-related NRQL queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

<Collapser id="core-compute-capacity-unit" title="Core Compute">
 CCU (Compute Capacity Unit) quantifies the compute resources needed for actions like page loads, queries, and API calls in New Relic. For the detailed information, refer to the definition of [Compute Capacity Unit (CCU)](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).

  **Core compute:** Applies to usage-based billing for actions you take or run related to APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and other features as made available. You are measured and billed based on your usage of [Core CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="advance-compute-capacity-unit" title="Advanced Compute">
 CCU (Compute Capacity Unit) quantifies the compute resources needed for actions like page loads, queries, and API calls in New Relic. For the detailed information, refer to the definition of [Compute Capacity Unit (CCU)](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).

**Advanced Compute:** Applies to usage-based billing for actions you run related to certain products like Codestream, Live Archives, and other features as they are made available. You are measured and billed based on your usage of [Advanced CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).

  <Callout variant="tip"> 
    Your use of CodeStream under Advanced Compute will incur Advanced CCU charges, regardless of user type. This means that basic users can access Advanced Compute features and incur charges for Advanced CCUs.

### Billing for add-on features [#add-on-billing]

In addition to the primary billing factors of GB ingested and billable users, you can also use optional billable add-ons to enrich your experience with New Relic. 

* **EU Data Center for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies to your data option (Original Data or Data Plus) when you select the European Union as your data region, as available.
* **Extended Retention for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies if you exceed the default length of time your data is retained. This applies to all your data—not just logs—and is a good option if you need to make a lot of small queries or make queries on large volumes of data.
* **Live Archives**: Extend your log storage duration up to seven years. Live Archives also requires Advanced Compute.
* **New Relic Synthetic Checks**: This add-on applies if your Checks exceed the default number of synthetic monitor checks.
* **Vulnerability Management**: This feature is included with Data Plus, but the add-on applies if you use the Vulnerability Management feature without Data Plus.
