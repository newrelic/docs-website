Whether you're thinking about using New Relic or are already sending telemetry to our platform, it's good for you to understand how the business side of New Relic works. 

We offer a variety of options in our pricing model, editions, and buying programs. To get acquainted with these three areas, take a look at the diagram and descriptions that follow.

## Pricing model [#pricing-model]

Our usage-based pricing model is composed of three factors that could affect your bill. Some factors are optional, so what you pay depends on which options you choose.

### Billing for data [#billing-for-data]

We bill for data by GB ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You have access to 100 GB Ingested per month for free. To learn more about how we bill for data, see [Data billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). To keep track of your GB Ingested, you can use our [Usage Summary](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-ui) page or [run queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

### Billing for user type [#billing-for-user-type]

We bill for certain user types. Core users and full platform users are billable, and basic users are free. The cost per full platform user depends on your edition. With our Free edition, you get one free full platform user. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  Your choice of edition will affect the cost per user type. 
</Callout>

To learn more about how we bill for users, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

### Billing for add-on features [#add-on-billing]

Selected features are available as optional add-ons. To learn more, see [Add-on billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing).

* Users #21-30 at price z 

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z.

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative.

## Core user release [#core-acceptance]

In January of 2022, we released a third [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): the core user. New Relic organizations created after the core user release had access to that user type and the associated [changes to billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). Existing organizations had the option to enable core users by opting in via an acceptance form called the `core amendment`. For some organizations, this acceptance process is available on the <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT> UI page.

The user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. Note that opting in to this release puts your organization on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions).

## What counts as billable GB Ingested? [#usage-calculation]

In the context of the [New Relic pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), "ingested data" refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

In general, data that we generate to provide our features doesn't count towards your GB Ingested. Examples of features and feature-related data that don't count towards GB Ingested include:

* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow). For example, `NrAiIncident`, an event used to generate these features, doesn't count towards GB Ingested.
* Data created by aggregated raw data (for example, [aggregated infrastructure data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#infrastructure-data) or [dimensional metric data](/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#dimensional-metrics)).
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) (for more on golden metrics, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)).
* Synthetic monitor checks. For details on synthetics billing, see [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits).
* Usage and billing tracking data (for example, `NrConsumption`).
* Data related to account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`).

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui).

## Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly GB Ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your organization uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

## Users: Billing and rules

On [our pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the count of billable users is a billing factor.

## Which users are billable? [#billable-users]

Billable users are users with a [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) of either core user or full platform user. Basic users are free.

Users are billable at the moment they're added as billable users to a New Relic organization. Even if a billable user has never logged in to New Relic and has a `Pending invite` tag in the UI, they're still billable.

## Manage users [#manage]

For how to manage users, see [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks).


## Manage user costs [#primary-version]

You can use the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) to get an overview of your billable user count. If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can also run [usage-related NRQL queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="user-count"
    title="How billable users are counted"
  >
    Billing for billable users is done per calendar month. To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a <DNT>**billable user type**</DNT> of either full platform user or core user. A user's <DNT>**billable user type**</DNT> is defined as the highest user type at which a user was set during a calendar month. We use UTC timezone to define the start and end of a calendar month.

    For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a calendar month, their billable user type for that month is `full platform user`, and won't change, even if they downgrade later in that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

    If you're planning on adding billable users or changing your users' user type, you should keep these rules in mind. Some tips:

    * If you want to add a billable user or upgrade a user, you will probably want to do that at the beginning of the month.
    * If you want to downgrade a user, you will probably want to do that at the end of the month.
    * We use UTC time to determine the start and end of a month. This means that if, for example, you were on Pacific time and you wanted to downgrade users on the last day of the month, you'd have to make those changes by 5pm Pacific time.

    Users in your organization with the same email address are only counted as one user. For more information, see [User tracking](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found#user-records).

    For users on our [newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): users are billable when they're added by admins as billable users. Even if a billable user has never logged in to New Relic and has a `Pending invite` tag in the UI, they're still billable. (For users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model), `Pending invite` users are not billable.)

    For more on adding and inviting users, see [Add users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#add-users).

    The cost of your billable users depends on an organization's [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), or on any custom deal you might have with New Relic.

    When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month.

  <Collapser
    id="user-downgrade-rules"
    title="User downgrade rules"
  >
    The rules pertaining to how many times you can downgrade full platform users differ depending on whether your [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans) is pay-as-you-go or a commitment contract.

## Add-on billing (optional)

In addition to the primary billing factors of GB Ingested and billable users, you can also use optional billable add-ons to extend your experience with New Relic. 

* **Advanced Compute (formerly Add-on Compute)**: This add-on applies to usage-based billing for actions you run related to Codestream, Live Archives, and other features as made available. You are measured and billed based on your usage of [Advanced CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit).

  <Callout variant="tip"> 
    Your use of CodeStream under Advanced Compute will incur CCU charges, regardless of user type. This means that free basic users can access Advanced Compute features and incur charges for Advanced CCUs.
  </Callout>
* **EU Data Center for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies to your data option (original Data or Data Plus) when you select the European Union as your data region, as available.
* **Extended Retention for Original Data or Data Plus**: This add-on applies if you exceed the default length of time your data is retained. This applies to all your data—not just logs—and is a good option if you need to make a lot of small queries or make queries on large volumes of data.
* **Live Archives**: Extend your log storage duration up to seven years. Live Archives also requires Advanced Compute.
* **New Relic Synthetic Checks**: This add-on applies if your Checks exceed the default number of synthetic monitor checks.
* **Vulnerability Management**: This feature is included with Data Plus, but the add-on applies if you use the Vulnerability Management feature without Data Plus.
