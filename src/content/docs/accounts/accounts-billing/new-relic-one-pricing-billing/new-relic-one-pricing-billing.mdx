Whether you're thinking about using New Relic or are already sending telemetry to our platform, it's good for you to understand how the business side of New Relic works. We offer a variety of options in these three areas:

* Pricing model
* Editions
* Buying programs

Here's a diagram showing a bird's eye view of these three groups of options, followed by explanations of each group:

  Some older New Relic customers are on our original pricing model. For more on that, see [Pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).
</Callout>

## Pricing model [#pricing-model]

Our usage-based pricing model is composed of three billing factors:

* <DNT>**Ingest**</DNT>: We bill on data ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. You can ingest 100 GBs of data per month for free. The price per GB above the free level varies depending on which data option you have: Data Plus or Original Data. To learn more about how we bill for ingested data, see [Data ingest billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/). To keep track of your ingest, you can use our [Plan & usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-ui) page or [run queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/).
* <DNT>**Users**</DNT>: We bill for certain user types. Core users and full platform users are billable, and basic users are free. The cost per full platform user depends on your edition. With our Free edition, you get one free full platform user. To learn more about how we bill for users, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/).
* <DNT>**Add-ons**</DNT>: These are optional features you can purchase separately. For more about this, see [Add-on billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To get estimates of your usage for managing costs, you can view the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-ui) or [run queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).
</Callout>

## Editions [#editions]

We have four pricing editions that are bundles of administrative features:

* Free
* Standard
* Pro
* Enterprise

When you create a New Relic organization, you start out on our Free edition. When you're ready to unlock more New Relic features and power, and ready to start paying, you'll choose either the Standard, Pro, or Enterprise edition.

Besides determining how much your full platform users cost, your edition controls access to some features and different limits. For example, the editions have different amounts of included synthetic monitor checks, and only Pro and Enterprise editions have access to [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus) (which includes access to HIPAA and FedRAMP compliancy). Also, with Standard, you can have a maximum of five full platform users. For more on edition differences, see our [pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Buying programs [#buying-programs]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how your billing is scheduled and implemented. Here are the main options:

* <DNT>**Pay-as-you-go**</DNT>: With this option, billing happens at the end of each calendar month. There are no payment commitments past the current month and an organization can cancel at any time. An organization's first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from when their credit card information was input into New Relic.
* <DNT>**Commitment contracts**</DNT>: Commitment contract options include our Volume Plan and our Savings Plan. With commitment contracts, an estimate of long-term expected usage is created and there's an agreed upon payment commitment. If an organization's usage exceeds that commitment, the excess usage is billed at the previously agreed-upon rates. These are available primarily to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations.

To understand our buying program terms, see [Usage Plan](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-usage-plan).

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Free edition details [#free]

You can use New Relic free, forever. Here are some details about what you get on the Free edition:

* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month

* One [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and unlimited [basic and core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)

* A single account in your New Relic organization (adding [additional accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) requires [Pro or Enterprise edition](#editions))

For the Free edition, if your data ingest exceeds 100 GBs in a calendar month, your ingest is disabled until the next month. At the start of the next month, it may take up to 24 hours for ingest to start again.

Here are some other limits that apply on the Free edition:

* Lacks [ticketed technical support](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings)
* [Synthetic monitor check limits](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits): 500 per month (compared to 10K for paid Standard)
* [Dimensional metric limits are lower](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes/#additional-considerations) than for paid editions
* For the alerting workflow feature, the [enrichment feature](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#enrichments) isn't available

## Understand order terms [#order]

Your New Relic order and your invoice contain several details about your pricing plan. Here's an example of an item found on a New Relic order to help you better understand what those items mean:

```
New Relic Volume Plan - Pro Full Platform Users
```

Here's a breakdown of these terms:

* `New Relic`: This means you're on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). (If this is `New Relic One`, that means you're on our original user billing version.)
* `Volume Plan`: This means your organization is on our volume plan [buying program](#usage-plans).
* `Pro`: This refers to the Pro [pricing edition](#editions).
* `Full Platform Users`: This refers to the [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).

Here's another example of an order item:

```
New Relic - Pro Full Platform Users (PAYG)
```

The `PAYG` at the end means your organization is on our pay-as-you-go [buying program](#usage-plans).

For more details about order terms, see our [license docs](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions).

## Tiered pricing [#tiered-pricing]

For Pro and Enterprise edition organizations with [contracts](#editions): Some of these organizations have access to tiered pricing for data and/or billable users. Tiered pricing means that higher levels of data ingest or billable users can unlock lower costs. The prices and tier levels will vary depending on an organization's specific contract.

Here's an example of how tiered pricing might work for an organization that has tiered pricing for full platform users:

* Users #1-10 at price x
* Users #11-20 at price y (lower than x)
* Users #21-30 at price z (lower than y)

Note that the billable users in lower tiers remain billable at that tier's cost, regardless of how many other, less expensive tiers are unlocked for subsequent users. In the example above, if the customer has 29 full platform users for the month, then the billable full platform users for the month would be the sum of: a) 10 users multiplied by price x, b) 10 users multiplied by price y, and c) 9 users multiplied by price z.

If you want access to tiered pricing, talk to your account representative.

## Core user release [#core-acceptance]

In January of 2022, we released a third [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): the core user. New Relic organizations created after the core user release had access to that user type and the associated [changes to billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions). Existing organizations had the option to enable core users by opting in via an acceptance form called the `core amendment`. For some organizations, this acceptance process is available on the <DNT>**Manage your plan**</DNT> UI page.

The user that accepts this amendment from the UI is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. Note that opting in to this release puts your organization on our [primary user billing version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#pricing-versions).
