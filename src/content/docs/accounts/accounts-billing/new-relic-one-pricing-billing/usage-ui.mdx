If you're a New Relic customer, you can see your usage on our <DNT>**Plan & usage**</DNT> page. While the numbers are an approximation, you can use those views to get a general idea about how your consumption might affect your bill.

To view the usage UI, go to <DNT>**one.newrelic.com**</DNT>, click the user menu, and then click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Plan & usage UI**</DNT> page shows an overview of your usage like this:

In addition to using the usage UI, you can also run queries to gauge your usage. For details, see [Query and alert on usage data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/).
