If you are a New Relic Compute customer, your monthly bill for New Relic is based on your core or advanced compute usage, data ingest usage, and any additional add-ons. The <dnt>**Usage UI**</dnt> provides visualizations to help billing administrators understand their organization's collective usage in a given month or day. This collective usage is aggregated across the accounts that are contained within the organization. You can also explore more granular details, allowing you to pinpoint exactly which capabilities, accounts, or users are contributing how much to your total consumption. While the numbers are an approximation, you can use it to get a general idea about how your consumption might affect your bill.

To view the <dnt>**Usage UI**</dnt>, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > (click your user name) > Administration > Usage Summary**. This page shows an overview of your usage:

From the default UI, you can view metrics such as total data ingested, core compute usage, advanced compute usage, and data retention for the current month, updated daily. Depending on your organization's requirements, you can choose to see consumption on a daily basis or review historical data from previous months.

To analyze your organization's usage in more detail, you can use the following resources:

* **Data ingestion (GB) usage:**  
    - For information about querying and alerting on data ingestion (GB) usage, refer [Query and alert on usage data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/#data-queries).
    - For granular details on data usage, from the <dnt>**Data ingest (GB)**</dnt> section, select <dnt>**View details**</dnt>. The <dnt>**[Data Ingestion UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic/)**</dnt> opens with the summary of your usage by data source.

* **Core and advanced compute usage:**  
    - For information about querying and alerting on core and advanced compute usage, see [Query and alert on compute usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/#compute-queries).
    - For granular details on CCU usage,  from the <dnt>**Core compute**</dnt> or <dnt>**Advanced compute**</dnt> section, select <dnt>**View details**</dnt>. The <dnt>**[Compute Management UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/compute-management/)**</dnt> opens with the segrigated data of the CCU usage by capabilities, users, and accounts.
