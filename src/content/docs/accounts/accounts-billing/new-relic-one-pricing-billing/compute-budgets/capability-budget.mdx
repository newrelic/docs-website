Organizations with multiple New Relic accounts can use capability-level budgets to monitor CCU usage and receive timely alerts, supporting cost control objectives. For example, if capabilities like alerts or dashboards consume excessive CCUs, setting up specific budgets allows for effective management and control.

## Set up capability level budgets

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ## Access compute budgets

    To access compute budgets, go to New Relic, from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT> > <DNT>**Compute Budgets**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add a functional budget
    
    In the **Functional budgets** section, click <DNT>**Add a fuctional budget**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Choose the method to set up the budget

    1. In the **Choose method** section, select **For capabilities** as the budget type, and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a name for your budget, and assign the list of capabilities to the particular budget.
    3. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to set up the budget limit.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Set monthly budget limits
    1. In the **Set budget limits** section, specify the amount of advanced CCU and core CCU commitments you want to track in your budget.
        <Callout title="important">
          By default, allocated CCUs are distributed evenly among all capabilities. To allocate a different amount to specific capabilities, select the **Limits for each capability** dropdown and customize the CCUs for each capability.
        </Callout>
    2. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to set up notifications.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Set up notifications
    1. On the **Set up notifications** page, edit the default notification settings to prevent overages and manage costs effectively by configuring the budget threshold percentage and notification type.
    2. Click **Add notification** to add an additional notification for the budget. Configure the following options:
       - **Budget threshold**: Specify the percentage at which you want to be notified.
       - **Notification type**: Choose from the dropdown list.
       - **Notify people who aren't on this budget**: Toggle this option on to notify individuals not included in the budget.
       - **Email addresses**: Optionally, add email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
    3. Click **Add notification** to save the notification settings. Once saved, the custom notification appears on the **Set up notifications** page.
    4. Click **Next** to save the budget settings.

    ## Usage breakdown
    Click the three dots menu to view the **Usage breakdown**, which provides the following information:

      - A detailed day-over-day breakdown of your CCU usage graph for **Core CCU** and **Advanced CCU**.
      - CCU usage divided by **Users**, **Accounts**, and **Capabilities**.
      - Details of the CCU, such as the **Budget name**, accounts associated with the budget, and information like **Budget time range**, **Advanced CCU**, **Core CCU**, and **Notification** information.
