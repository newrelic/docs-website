Organizations with multiple New Relic accounts can leverage user-level budgets to gain visibility into individual CCU usage and receive alerts. This feature supports proactive budget management, ensuring usage aligns with organizational goals.

For more granular monitoring, you can create budgets for specific user groups, allowing closer oversight of their CCU usage to meet organizational objectives.
