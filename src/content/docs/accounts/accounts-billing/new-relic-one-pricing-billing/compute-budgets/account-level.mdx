Organizations with multiple New Relic accounts, each having distinct CCU usage requirements, can leverage New Relic Compute Budgets to gain visibility into their usage patterns and receive alerts. Proactive mechanisms are vital to monitor and maintain budget adherence. Monitoring each account individually ensures that none exceed or fall below ideal usage limits, allowing for precise budget management tailored to each account's needs.

## Set up account level budgets

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access compute budgets

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration** > **Compute Budgets**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a functional budget
    
    To add a budget, navigate to the **Functional budgets** section and click **Add a budget**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Assign your budget

    1. Enter a name for your budget, and from the dropdown list, assign up to 5 accounts to this budget.
    2. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set monthly budget limits

    1. To set spending thresholds for your selected account, go to the **Set monthly budget limits** section and assign the limits for the compute SKUs you've purchased to establish your `account budget`.

    />
  </Step>

    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, go to the **Set up notifications** page. Set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the CCU assigned to a budget for a specific month, go to the **Thresholds** tab. Select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications.
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, go to the **Destinations** tab. Add at least one person to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.
    4. Click **Finish**.
