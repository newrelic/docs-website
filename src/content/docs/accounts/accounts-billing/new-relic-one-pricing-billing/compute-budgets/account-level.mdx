Organizations with multiple New Relic accounts, each with distinct CCU usage requirements, New Relic provides visibility into CCU usage and alerts. Proactive mechanisms are vital to control and maintain budget adherence. Monitoring each account individually ensures that none exceed or fall below ideal usage limits, allowing for precise budget management tailored to each account's needs.
