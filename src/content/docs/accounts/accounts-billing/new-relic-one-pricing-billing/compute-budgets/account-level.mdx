New Relic offers deep visibility into Compute Consumption Unit (CCU) usage and alerts for potential overages. However, proactive mechanisms to control and stay within budget are essential.

Consider an organization with multiple New Relic accounts, each with different CCU usage requirements. Monitoring each account individually ensures none exceed or fall below ideal usage limits.

## Set up account level budgets

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ## Access compute budgets
    To access compute budgets, go to New Relic, from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Administration**</DNT> > <DNT>**Compute Budgets**</DNT>.

    <Callout title="important">
      By default, the **Compute Budgets** landing page displays the default Organization budget, which includes the **Intelligent Observability (advanced CCU)** and **Full Stack Observability (core CCU)** budgets, based on your CCU commitments.
