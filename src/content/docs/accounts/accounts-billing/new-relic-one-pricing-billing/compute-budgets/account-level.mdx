For organizations with multiple New Relic accounts, each with distinct CCU requirements, Compute Budgets provides per-account monitoring, visibility, and alerts to ensure accounts stay within their defined usage limits.

## Budget types by customer structure

The type of budgets you can create depends on your customer structure:

### For single-tenant customers
You can create **account level budgets** for individual accounts or groups of up to 5 accounts within your organization.

### For multi-tenant customers

**Managing organizations** can create two types of budgets:
- **Organization level budgets**: Budgets for individual managed organizations
  - One budget per organization
  - One organization per budget
  - Create multiple organization level budgets as needed

- **Account level budgets**: Budgets for accounts within the managing organization (same functionality as single-tenant customers)

**Managed organizations** can't create budgets.

<Callout variant="important">
If you are part of a managing organization, you can create budgets for any managed organization under your customer hierarchy. Use the organization selector to choose the organization when creating an organization budget.
</Callout>

## Set up account level budgets

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Open Compute Budgets

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**.
    2. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select <DNT>**Administration**</DNT> > <DNT>**Compute Budgets**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create a budget

    In the <DNT>**Functional budgets**</DNT> section, select <DNT>**Add a budget**</DNT>.

    <Callout variant="important">
      **For multi-tenant customers**, this section displays:
      - <DNT>**Organization level budgets**</DNT> for managed organizations
      - <DNT>**Account level budgets**</DNT> for the managing organization

      Managed organizations can't create account level budgets.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Assign your budget

    1. Enter a name for your budget.
    2. Select the accounts or organization for your budget:

       **For single-tenant or managing organization account level budgets**: From the dropdown list, select and assign up to 5 accounts to this budget.

       **For multi-tenant organization level budgets**: Select one organization from the dropdown. Each organization level budget can contain only one organization.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         When creating organization level budgets, use the organization selector to view and select the managed organization for your budget.
       </Callout>

    3. Select <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set monthly budget limits

    1. To set spending thresholds for your selected account, in the <DNT>**Set monthly budget limits**</DNT> section, assign the limits for the compute SKUs you've purchased to establish your account budget.
    2. Select <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.

      src="/images/set-monthly-account-budget.webp"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, in the <DNT>**Set up notifications**</DNT> page, set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the CCU assigned to a budget for a specific month, in the <DNT>**Thresholds**</DNT> tab, select <DNT>**+ Add a threshold**</DNT> and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications.
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, in the <DNT>**Destinations**</DNT> tab, add at least one person to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - <DNT>**Email**</DNT>: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - <DNT>**Webhook**</DNT>: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.
    4. Select <DNT>**Finish**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>

    After you create the budget, view the details specific to the Compute SKUs on the <DNT>**Compute budgets**</DNT> page, as applicable and available to your order and account provisioning:
