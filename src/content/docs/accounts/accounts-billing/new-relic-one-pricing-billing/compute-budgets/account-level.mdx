Organizations with multiple New Relic accounts, each having distinct CCU usage requirements, can leverage New Relic Compute Budgets to gain visibility into their usage patterns and receive alerts. Proactive mechanisms are vital to monitor and maintain budget adherence. Monitoring each account individually ensures that none exceed or fall below ideal usage limits, allowing for precise budget management tailored to each account's needs.

## Budget types by customer structure

The type of budgets you can create depends on your customer structure:

### For single-tenant customers
You can create **account level budgets** for individual accounts or groups of up to 5 accounts within your organization.

### For multi-tenant customers

**Managing organizations** can create two types of budgets:
- **Organization level budgets**: Budgets for individual managed organizations
  - One budget per organization
  - One organization per budget
  - Create multiple organization level budgets as needed

- **Account level budgets**: Budgets for accounts within the managing organization (same functionality as single-tenant customers)

**Managed organizations** cannot create their own budgets.

<Callout variant="important">
If you are part of a managing organization, you can create budgets for any managed organization under your customer hierarchy. Use the organization selector to choose the organization when creating an organization budget.

## Set up account level budgets

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access compute budgets

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration** > **Compute Budgets**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a functional budget

    To add a budget, navigate to the **Functional budgets** section and click **Add a budget**.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Multi-tenant customers**: This section shows:
      - **Organization level budgets** for managed organizations
      - **Account level budgets** for the managing organization

      For managed organizations, you will see a message indicating that account level budget creation is not yet available.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Assign your budget

    1. Enter a name for your budget.
    2. Select the accounts or organization for your budget:

       **For single-tenant or managing organization account level budgets**: From the dropdown list, select and assign up to 5 accounts to this budget.

       **For multi-tenant organization level budgets**: Select one organization from the dropdown. Each organization level budget can contain only one organization.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         When creating organization level budgets, use the organization selector to view and select the managed organization for your budget.
       </Callout>

    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set monthly budget limits

    1. To set spending thresholds for your selected account, go to the **Set monthly budget limits** section and assign the limits for the compute SKUs you've purchased to establish your `account budget`.
    2. Click **Next**.

    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, go to the **Set up notifications** page. Set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the CCU assigned to a budget for a specific month, go to the **Thresholds** tab. Select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications.
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, go to the **Destinations** tab. Add at least one person to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.
    4. Click **Finish**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
