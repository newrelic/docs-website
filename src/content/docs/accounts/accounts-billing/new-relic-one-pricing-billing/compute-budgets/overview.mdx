Managing cloud costs effectively is crucial for many organizations. While New Relic provides deep visibility into your Compute Consumption Unit (CCU) usage and alerts for potential overages, proactive mechanisms to control and stay within budget are essential for effective cost management.

Compute Budgets provides a powerful governance mechanism to monitor and control your CCU usage, helping you stay within your ideal usage limits and manage costs effectively. With **Compute Budgets**, you can:

- **Proactively control costs**: Shift from a reactive to a proactive approach in budget management, allowing you to anticipate and manage budget issues before they occur.
- **Reduce manual effort**: Minimize the manual work required to track and control compute usage, freeing you to focus on higher-value tasks.
- **Improve confidence and adherence to budgets**: Gain greater control over your compute spend, improving your ability to adhere to budgets and manage costs effectively.
