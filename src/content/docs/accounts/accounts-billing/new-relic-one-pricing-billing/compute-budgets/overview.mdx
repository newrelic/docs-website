Compute Budgets provides a mechanism to monitor and alert on your Compute Consumption Unit (CCU) usage. This helps you stay within your ideal usage limits and effectively manage costs. With **Compute Budgets**, you can:

  - **Proactively monitor costs**: Move from a reactive to a proactive approach in budget management. This allows you to anticipate and address budget issues before they arise.
  - **Reduce manual effort**: Minimize the manual work required to track and monitor compute usage. This enables you to focus on higher-value tasks.
  - **Improve confidence and adherence to budgets**: Gain greater insights into your compute spend, enhancing your ability to adhere to budgets and effectively manage costs.
