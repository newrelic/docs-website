Compute Budgets provides a mechanism to monitor and alert on your Compute Consumption Unit (CCU) usage. This helps you stay within your ideal usage limits and effectively manage costs. With **Compute Budgets**, you can:

  - **Proactively monitor costs**: Move from a reactive to a proactive approach in budget management. This allows you to anticipate and address budget issues before they arise.
  - **Reduce manual effort**: Minimize the manual work required to track and monitor compute usage. This enables you to focus on higher-value tasks.
  - **Improve confidence and adherence to budgets**: Gain greater insights into your compute spend, enhancing your ability to adhere to budgets and effectively manage costs.

## Prerequisites

To use **Compute Budgets**, you must:

  - [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup/) for a New Relic account.
  - Be a customer with a contract commitment on either Core or Legacy Compute Capacity Units (CCUs). This includes both single-tenant and multi-tenant customers.
  - Have a minimum commitment amount defined on the Compute SKU.

## Multi-tenant budget structure

For multi-tenant customers, Compute Budgets uses a hierarchical structure.

### Budget hierarchy

The budget structure varies based on your customer type:

**Single-tenant customers:**
- **Organization Budget**: A default budget based on your contract commitment at the organization level
- **Account level budgets**: Optional budgets for individual accounts or groups of accounts within your organization

**Multi-tenant customers:**
- **Customer Budget**: A default budget based on your contract commitment at the customer level (replaces Organization Budget). This budget encompasses all organizations under your customer profile.
- **Organization level budgets**: Budgets for individual managed organizations under your customer hierarchy. Each organization can have one budget.
- **Account level budgets**: Budgets for accounts within the managing organization (same functionality as single-tenant customers)

### Managing vs Managed Organizations

In a multi-tenant setup:
- **Managing Organization**: The top-level organization under which all other organizations fall. The managing organization has full control over budget creation and management across all sub-organizations and accounts.
- **Managed Organizations**: Sub-organizations under the managing organization. Managed organizations do not have access to the Compute Budgets feature.

## Access controls

Budget management capabilities depend on your customer type and role:

### For single-tenant customers

Users with the `organization_manager` role can **create**, **update**, or **delete** the Organization Budget and account level budgets. These users must have access to the telemetry account.

Users with the `organization_read_only` role can **view** the Organization Budget and account level budgets. These users must have access to the telemetry account.

Users without access to the telemetry account cannot view the Organization Budget. However, they can view account level budgets if they have access to those specific accounts.

### For multi-tenant customers

**Managing Organization Admins** have full access to:
  - Create and manage the Customer Budget (default budget based on contract commitment)
  - Create and manage organization level budgets for any managed organization
  - Create and manage account level budgets for accounts within the managing organization
  - View and update budget thresholds and notification settings across all budgets

**Managed Organizations** do not have access to the Compute Budgets feature.
