Effective cost management is crucial for organizations and New Relic offers deep visibility into your CCU usage. However, implementing proactive mechanisms to alert and stay within budget can help manage costs effectively across the organization.

## Manage organization level budgets limits

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access compute budgets

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration** > **Compute Budgets**.

    <Callout title="important">
      When you open the **Compute Budgets** landing page, the **Organization Budget** appears by default. This budget reflects the SKUs you've purchased and updates monthly. It provides a clear overview of your Compute Consumption Unit (CCU) commitments across these SKUs, helping you manage and monitor your compute usage effectively.

    In the **Organization Budget** section, click **Manage limits**. The **Edit Organization Budget** page appears.
  </Step>

    ### Manage monthly budget limits

    1. To update the spending thresholds for your organization, go to the **Set monthly budget limits** section and specify the amount of compute CCU you want to track in your `Org budget`.

    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, go to the **Set up organization budget notifications** page. Set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the CCU assigned to a budget for a specific month, go to the **Thresholds** tab. Select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications.
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, go to the **Destinations** tab. Add at least one person to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.
    4. Click **Finish**.
