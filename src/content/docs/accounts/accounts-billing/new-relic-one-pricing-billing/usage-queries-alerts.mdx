To help you understand your [New Relic usage and billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), we provide a [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui) for understanding your billing-related usage. Additionally, you can run custom NRQL queries to get additional detail, and you can create alert notifications for when your usage has reached certain levels. 

## Data ingest usage queries [#data-queries]

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui) displays your data ingest over time. If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can use NRQL queries like these: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="daily-gb"
    title="Daily data usage"
  >
This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="daily-source"
    title="Daily usage by source"
  >
This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago 
FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metrics-analysis"
    title="Metrics ingest by source"
  >
This query breaks down [Metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by `appName` or `host` to adjust the analysis.

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' 
SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' 
FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-gb"
    title="Month-to-date data usage"
  >
This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Month-to-date estimated data cost"
  >
For how to determine an estimate of cost, see [Estimated cost queries](#estimated-cost).
  </Collapser>

## Data ingest and query limits [#data-limits]

For information about data ingest limits and query limits, see [Query system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits).

## User count queries [#user-queries]

For a display of your user count, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui). If you need more detail than that, you can use the example NRQL queries below. For details about how users are calculated, see [Billable user calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

Most New Relic organization have the ability to add core users. This section includes queries that will work for those organizations. If you're in an older organization that hasn't [opted in to unlock core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#core-acceptance), see [Queries for organizations without core users](#queries-non-core).  

Here are some rules for querying your users:

* Use only the `NrMTDConsumption` event.
* The attributes used to query by user type are: `BasicUsersBillable`, `CoreUsersBillable`, and `FullPlatformUsersBillable`.

Here are some example NRQL queries for determining user count:

### Month-to-date full platform users

This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your full platform users for that month if you were billed right now.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)
```

### Month-to-date core users
This query shows the number of core users you'd be billed for if you were billed right now:

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable)
```

### Estimated cost

Here's a query for getting the current month's cost for your full platform users. Note that you'll have to know your organization's full platform user cost.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable) * <var>YOUR_PER_FULL_PLATFORM_USER_COST</var>
```

### User queries for organizations without core users [#queries-non-core]

These queries apply for some older New Relic organizations that have only two user types available: basic users and full platform users.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="non-core-org-user-queries"
    title="User queries for organizations without core users"
  >
For organizations that don't have core users enabled, here are some rules for querying your users:
* You can use the `NrMTDConsumption` or `NrConsumption` event.
* The attributes used to query by user type are: `BasicUsersBillable`, and `FullUsersBillable`.

### Billable full platform users for the month
This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for the current month if you were charged at that moment.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
    SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable)
```

This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time.

```sql
FROM NrConsumption 
SELECT max(FullUsers) 
SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour
```

### Projected monthly full platform user count
    
This query shows a projected count of monthly full platform users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month:

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days)
SINCE '2020-09-01'
```

### Count of full platform users and basic users
    
The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#billing-usage-ui) shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is:

```sql
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') 
FACET metric
```

To see the count of full platform users and basic users over time:

```
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour
```

### Estimated cost
    
Here's a query for getting the current month's cost for your full platform users. Note that you'll have to know your organization's full platform user cost.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)* <var>YOUR_PER_FULL_PLATFORM_USER_COST</var> 
```

Here's an equivalent one for your core users: 

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable)* <var>YOUR_PER_CORE_USER_COST</var>
```

  </Collapser>

## Synthetics usage [#synthetics-usage]

There are a certain number of synthetics checks included for free with each edition. For details on that, see [Synthetics limits](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits).

The [NrDailyUsage event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage) is the event type that can best help you understand synthetics usage. It's generated once per day. Usage timestamps correspond to the time that New Relic receives and processes a synthetic check. This may introduce a slight difference in usage data compared to the time the synthetic check was executed. 

By using [`FACET`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-facet), you can break your consumption into multiple categories, including account, location, monitor type, and monitor name. If you have a [parent account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/), ensure you run queries in a parent account to see the aggregated usage for that parent and its child accounts.

Both successful and failed checks contribute to overall synthetics consumption. Below are sample queries to view and facet your synthetics consumption:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="TotalUsage"
    title="Total synthetics consumption"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' SINCE 1 month ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="UsageByMonth"
    title="Synthetics consumption by month"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' 
    SINCE 6 months ago 
    FACET monthOf(timestamp)
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="UsageByAccount"
    title="Synthetics consumption by account"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' 
    SINCE 1 month ago 
    FACET consumingAccountName
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="UsageByMonitorType"
    title="Synthetics consumption by monitor type"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' 
    SINCE 1 month ago 
    FACET syntheticsTypeLabel
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="UsageByMonitorName"
    title="Synthetics consumption by monitor name"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' 
    SINCE 1 month ago 
    FACET syntheticsMonitorName
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="UsageByLocation"
    title="Synthetics consumption by location"
    >
    ```sql
    SELECT (sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount)) 
    AS 'Total Checks' 
    FROM NrDailyUsage 
    WHERE syntheticsTypeLabel != 'Ping' 
    SINCE 1 month ago 
    FACET syntheticsLocationLabel
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Cost-related queries [#estimated-cost]

Here are some query recommendations for helping you understand the estimated cost for the current month. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Get estimated cost of data for the month"
  >
Here's a query for arriving at an estimate of your data ingest cost for the current month. To run this query, you'll need to know your organization's [per-GB ingested data cost](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*YOUR_PER_GB_COST
```

Here's an example of this query using a [per-GB cost of $0.30](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-prices): 

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*.30
```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="user-cost"
    title="Get billable user cost for the month"
  >
See the billable user query sections: 

* [For organizations with core users](#user-queries)
* [For organizations without core users](#non-core-org-user-queries)

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Set usage alerts [#alerts]

To help [manage your billing](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data), you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in data ingest or user count.

Before building usage-related alert conditions, here are some tips:

* For basics about how to set up alerts, see [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create).
* The [event timer aggregation method](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/#event-timer-detail) is recommended because it works best for infrequent data.

Here are some NRQL alert condition examples.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-value"
    title="Ingested gigabytes exceeds threshold"
  >
This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption 
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```

If your organization has multiple [child accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts), you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific account:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption 
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD_ACCOUNT_ID
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds GB threshold"
  >
This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs:

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="user-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds user count threshold"
  >
This is an example for an alert query that will trigger when your user count of full platform users exceeds a certain number:

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)
```

Note that this query applies for organizations with the primary version of our usage-based pricing, with core users. For more about this and about how to query user counts, see [Query users](#user-queries).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="usage-exceeds-cost"
    title="Usage exceeds estimated cost threshold"
  >
In May of 2022, the `estimatedCost` attribute was deprecated ([learn more](/docs/release-notes/org-user-mgmt-release-notes/org-users-22-05-01)). If you're using that attribute, you should replace it with the query recommended here. 

Note that to run this query you'll need to know your organization's per-GB ingested data cost.

```sql
FROM NrMTDConsumption 
SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*YOUR_PER_GB_COST
```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For setting up alerts related to data ingest limits and query limits, see [Set alerts for hitting data limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits#set-alerts-on-resource-metrics).

## Query changes to your account [#account-changes]

To see changes made to your account (for example, changes related to managing users), you can query [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).

## Usage-related data types [#data-types]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For an advanced deep dive into managing data ingest in a complex organization, see [Data ingest governance](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-intro/).
</Callout>

Usage data is attached to the following events. For more detail on which event to use for querying users, see [Query users](#user-queries).

* `NrUsage` records usage every hour and is used to see the types of data being reported (for example, <InlinePopover type="apm" /> data or browser monitoring data).
* `NrConsumption` records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of "real-time" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time.
* `NrMTDConsumption` generates aggregate values from the `NrConsumption` event. Use this event to see usage by monthly billing period. This is the best event for querying user count.

## Data ingest attributes [#data-ingest-attributes]

Below are some of the most important attributes attached to [usage events](#data-types).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `productLine`
      </td>

      <td>
        The category of usage. There are three options: `DataPlatform`, `FullStackObservability`, and `ProactiveDetection`. (Starting November 1, 2021, `IncidentIntelligence` is no longer a billing factor.) For more details about these categories, see [New Relic platform](https://newrelic.com/platform).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `metric`
      </td>

      <td>
        This consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by `productLine`. It's an enum with possible values of `BasicUsers`, `FullPlatformUsers`, and `GigabytesIngested`. Values for the [core user release](#user-queries) include `FullPlatformUsers` and `CoreUsers`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `consumingAccountId`
      </td>

      <td>
        ID of the New Relic account directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> used.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
