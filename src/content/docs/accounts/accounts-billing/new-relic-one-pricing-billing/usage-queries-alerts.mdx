For accounts on our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), we provide a [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui) for understanding your billing-related usage and a [UI for managing billing-related data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data). Additionally, you can:

* [Query your usage data](#query) to get more detail than is available in the UI.
* [Set up NRQL alert conditions](#alerts) to get notifications about changes in your usage.

Note that if you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), your account hierarchy may affect your queried data. For more information, see [Account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/account-user-structure).

## Data ingest usage queries [#data-queries] 

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui) displays your data ingest over time. If you need more detail than the UI provides, here are some example [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) queries:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="daily-gb"
    title="Daily data usage"
  >
    This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
       SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="daily-source"
    title="Daily usage by source"
  >
    This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago 
       FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="metrics-analysis"
    title="Metrics ingest by source"
  >
This query breaks down [Metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by `appName` or `host` to adjust the analysis.

    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' 
      SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' 
      FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-gb"
    title="Month-to-date data usage"
  >
    This query shows the current full platform user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now.

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Month-to-date estimated data cost"
  >
    This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## User count queries [#user-queries]

For a display of your user count, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui). If you need more detail than that, you can use the example NRQL queries below. For details about how users are calculated, see [User calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

We have two versions of the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), and the version you're on impacts how your billable users are calculated, and affects your NRQL query format: 

* New Relic One pricing **without core users** (only two [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): basic and full platform): This is the primary version of our New Relic One pricing model. See [example queries](#primary-user-queries). 
* New Relic One pricing **with core users**: This pricing version is in [limited availability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release). See [example queries](#core-version-user-queries).

Example queries for each of these pricing versions are below: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="primary-user-queries"
    title="Primary pricing version (without core users)"
  >

The following queries apply if you're on the [New Relic One without core users pricing](#user-queries) version. 

**Billable full platform users for the month**
This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for the current month if you were charged at that moment.

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable) 
      SINCE this month
    ```

    This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time.

    ```
    from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) 
      SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour
    ```

**Projected monthly full platform user count**
This query shows a projected count of monthly full platform users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) 
    SINCE '2020-09-01'
    ```

**Count of full platform users and basic users**
The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#billing-usage-ui) shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is:

    ```
    FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
    WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
    WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') 
    FACET metric
    ```

To see the count of full platform users and basic users over time:

    ```
    FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
    WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
    WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour
    ```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="core-version-user-queries"
    title="Core users release (limited availability)"
  >

If your organization is on the [New Relic One with core users pricing version](#user-queries), here are some rules for querying your users: 
  * Use only the `NrMTDConsumption` event. 
  * The attributes used to query by user type are: `BasicUsersBillable`, `CoreUsersBillable`, and `FullPlatformUsersBillable`. 

Here are some example NRQL queries for determining user count: 

**Month-to-date full platform users**
This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your full platform users for that month if you were billed right now.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable) SINCE this month
```

**Month-to-date core users**
This query shows the number of core users you’d be billed for if you were billed right now:
```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable) SINCE this month
```

**Track users during the switch to core users pricing version**

If your organization started out with [New Relic One pricing without core users](#user-queries) and opted in to switch to the [core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release), here's an example query that can be used for tracking your full platform users over that switch: 
```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(billableConsumption) as 'Full platform users' where metric in ('FullPlatformUsers', 'FullUsers') SINCE 3 month ago limit max TIMESERIES 
```

## Set usage alerts [#alerts]

To help [manage your billing](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data), you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in data ingest or user count. 

Before building usage-related alert conditions, here are some tips: 

* For basics about how to set up alerts, see [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create).
* The [event timer aggregation method](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/#event-timer-detail) is recommended because it works best for infrequent data.

Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-value"
    title="Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
    ```

    If you have multiple [child accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts), you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID</var>
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="user-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable)
    ```

    For more about how to query user counts, see [Query users](#user-queries). 
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="usage-exceeds-cost"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Query changes to your account [#account-changes]

To see changes made to your account (for example, changes related to managing users), you can query [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).

## Usage-related data types [#data-types]

Usage data is attached to the following events. For more detail on which event to use for querying users, see [Query users](#user-queries).

* `NrUsage` records usage every hour and is used to see the types of data being reported (for example, APM data or browser monitoring data).
* `NrConsumption` records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of "real-time" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time.
* `NrMTDConsumption` generates aggregate values from the `NrConsumption` event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. 

## Data ingest attributes [#data-ingest-attributes]

Below are some of the most important attributes attached to [usage events](#data-types).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `productLine`
      </td>

      <td>
        The category of usage. There are three options: `DataPlatform`, `FullStackObservability`, and `ProactiveDetection`. (Starting November 1, 2021, `IncidentIntelligence` is no longer a billing factor.) For more details about these categories, see [New Relic platform](https://newrelic.com/platform).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `metric`
      </td>

      <td>
        This consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by `productLine`. It's an enum with possible values of `BasicUsers`, `FullUsers`, and `GigabytesIngested`. Values for the [core user release](#user-queries) include `FullPlatformUsers` and `CoreUsers`. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `consumingAccountId`
      </td>

      <td>
        ID of the New Relic account directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `estimatedCost`
      </td>

      <td>
        Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
