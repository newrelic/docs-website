For accounts on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), we provide a [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui) for understanding your billing-related usage and a [UI for managing billing-related data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data). Additionally, you can:

* [Query your usage data](#query) to get more detail than is available in the UI.
* [Set up NRQL alert conditions](#alerts) to get notifications about changes in your usage.

Note that if you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), your account hierarchy may affect your queried data. For more information, see [Account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/account-user-structure).

## Data ingest usage queries [#data-queries]

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui) displays your data ingest over time. If you need more detail than the UI provides, here are some example [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) queries:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="daily-gb"
    title="Daily data usage"
  >
This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months:

```
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="daily-source"
    title="Daily usage by source"
  >
This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source:

```
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago 
FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metrics-analysis"
    title="Metrics ingest by source"
  >
This query breaks down [Metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by `appName` or `host` to adjust the analysis.

```
FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' 
SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' 
FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-gb"
    title="Month-to-date data usage"
  >
This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Month-to-date estimated data cost"
  >
For how to determine an estimate of cost, see [Estimated cost queries](#estimated-cost).
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

## Data ingest and query limits [#data-limits]

For information about data ingest limits and query limits, see [Query system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits).

## User count queries [#user-queries]

For a display of your user count, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui). If you need more detail than that, you can use the example NRQL queries below. For details about how users are calculated, see [User calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

We have [two versions of our usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release/#overview), and the version you're on impacts how your billable users are calculated, and thus affects how you query those users:

* Our primary version (with core users): See [example queries for this version](#core-version-user-queries).
* Our version **without** core users (only two available [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): basic and full platform): See [example queries for this version](#primary-user-queries).

Here are example queries for these two pricing versions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="core-version-user-queries"
    title="Primary pricing version (with core users)"
  >
<Callout variant="important">
  This section applies for organizations on our [primary usage-based pricing version](#user-queries), which has three user types: basic users, core users, and full platform users.
</Callout>

Here are some rules for querying your users:

* Use only the `NrMTDConsumption` event.
* The attributes used to query by user type are: `BasicUsersBillable`, `CoreUsersBillable`, and `FullPlatformUsersBillable`.

Here are some example NRQL queries for determining user count:

### Month-to-date full platform users

This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your full platform users for that month if you were billed right now.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)
```

### Month-to-date core users
This query shows the number of core users you'd be billed for if you were billed right now:

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable)
```

### Estimated cost

For how to determine an estimate of the cost for your billable users, see [Estimated cost queries](#user-cost).

### Track users during the switch to core users pricing version
    
If your organization started out with [the version of our usage-based pricing without core users](#user-queries) and opted in to switch to the [core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release), the usage UI will track the count of your billable users over that transition. Here's an example of a query that would display the count of full platform users over that transition period:

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(billableConsumption) as 'Full platform users' where metric in ('FullPlatformUsers', 'FullUsers') SINCE 4 month ago limit max TIMESERIES 
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="primary-user-queries"
    title="Version without core users"
  >
<Callout variant="important">
These queries apply if you're on the [version of our usage-based pricing without core users](#user-queries), which has only two user types: basic users and full platform users.
</Callout>

Here are some rules for querying your users:
* You can use the `NrMTDConsumption` or `NrConsumption` event.
* The attributes used to query by user type are: `BasicUsersBillable`, and `FullUsersBillable`.

### Billable full platform users for the month
This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for the current month if you were charged at that moment.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable)
```

This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time.

```
FROM NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour
```

### Projected monthly full platform user count
This query shows a projected count of monthly full platform users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month:

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01'
```

### Count of full platform users and basic users
The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#billing-usage-ui) shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is:

```
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') 
FACET metric
```

To see the count of full platform users and basic users over time:

```
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour
```

### Estimated cost
For how to determine an estimate of the cost for your billable users, see [Estimated cost queries](#user-cost).

## Cost-related queries [#estimated-cost]

In May of 2022, we deprecated the `estimatedCost` attribute from usage events and removed the current month's estimated cost from the UI ([learn more](/docs/release-notes/org-user-mgmt-release-notes/org-users-22-05-01)). If you currently use the `estimatedCost` attribute in your queries or alert conditions, you should remove them, or replace them with the recommended queries below. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Get this month's estimated cost for data"
  >
In May of 2022 we deprecated the `estimatedCost` attribute. See the note above for more about the estimated cost change. 

Here's a query for arriving at an estimate of your data ingest cost for the current month. To run this query, you'll need to know your organization's [per-GB ingested data cost](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*<var>YOUR_PER_GB_COST</var>
```

Here's an example of this query using a per-GB cost of $.30: 

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*.30
```
</Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="user-cost"
    title="Get this month's billable user cost"
  >

As noted in the [user count query section](#user-queries), we have two versions of pricing: 

* The primary version, with core users
* The version without core users 

The version you have dictates how you query your user count data. 

### Primary version, with core users  

Here's a query for getting the current month's cost for your full platform users. Note that you'll have to know your organization's full platform user cost.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable)* <var>YOUR_PER_FULL_PLATFORM_USER_COST</var>
```

### Version without core users 

Here's a query for getting the current month's cost for your full platform users. Note that you'll have to know your organization's full platform user cost.


```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)* <var>YOUR_PER_FULL_PLATFORM_USER_COST</var> 
```

Here's an equivalent one for your core users: 

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable)* <var>YOUR_PER_CORE_USER_COST</var>
```
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>



## Set usage alerts [#alerts]

To help [manage your billing](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data), you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in data ingest or user count.

Before building usage-related alert conditions, here are some tips:

* For basics about how to set up alerts, see [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create).
* The [event timer aggregation method](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/#event-timer-detail) is recommended because it works best for infrequent data.

Here are some NRQL alert condition examples.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-value"
    title="Ingested gigabytes exceeds threshold"
  >
This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value:

```
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```

If your organization has multiple [child accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts), you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific account:

```
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_CHILD_ACCOUNT_ID</var>
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds GB threshold"
  >
This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs:

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="user-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds user count threshold"
  >
This is an example for an alert query that will trigger when your user count of full platform users exceeds a certain number:

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)
```

Note that this query applies for organizations with the primary version of our usage-based pricing, with core users. For more about this and about how to query user counts, see [Query users](#user-queries).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="usage-exceeds-cost"
    title="Usage exceeds estimated cost threshold"
  >
In May of 2022, the `estimatedCost` attribute was deprecated ([learn more](/docs/release-notes/org-user-mgmt-release-notes/org-users-22-05-01)). If you're using that attribute, you should replace it with the query recommended here. 

Note that to run this query you'll need to know your organization's per-GB ingested data cost.

```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngestedBillable)*<var>YOUR_PER_GB_COST</var>
```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For setting up alerts related to data ingest limits and query limits, see [Set alerts for hitting data limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits#set-alerts-on-resource-metrics).

## Query changes to your account [#account-changes]

To see changes made to your account (for example, changes related to managing users), you can query [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).

## Usage-related data types [#data-types]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For an advanced deep dive into managing data ingest in a complex organization, see [Data ingest governance](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-intro/).
</Callout>

Usage data is attached to the following events. For more detail on which event to use for querying users, see [Query users](#user-queries).

* `NrUsage` records usage every hour and is used to see the types of data being reported (for example, APM data or browser monitoring data).
* `NrConsumption` records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of "real-time" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time.
* `NrMTDConsumption` generates aggregate values from the `NrConsumption` event. Use this event to see usage by monthly billing period. For organizations on the [core users release](#user-queries), this is the best event for querying user count.

## Data ingest attributes [#data-ingest-attributes]

Below are some of the most important attributes attached to [usage events](#data-types).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `productLine`
      </td>

      <td>
        The category of usage. There are three options: `DataPlatform`, `FullStackObservability`, and `ProactiveDetection`. (Starting November 1, 2021, `IncidentIntelligence` is no longer a billing factor.) For more details about these categories, see [New Relic platform](https://newrelic.com/platform).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `metric`
      </td>

      <td>
        This consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by `productLine`. It's an enum with possible values of `BasicUsers`, `FullUsers`, and `GigabytesIngested`. Values for the [core user release](#user-queries) include `FullPlatformUsers` and `CoreUsers`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `consumingAccountId`
      </td>

      <td>
        ID of the New Relic account directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
