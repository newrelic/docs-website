metaDescription: How to add accounts to your New Relic organization. 
---

How you add accounts to your New Relic organization depends on the type of [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) your users are on: 

* New Relic One user model: if you're on our newer user model, you currently can't add accounts using the UI but must talk to your account representative. For more information, see [Organization structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 
* Original user model: you can add accounts via the UI. For more information, see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/#creating). 

Want to determine which you're on? See [Determine user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#determine-user-model).
