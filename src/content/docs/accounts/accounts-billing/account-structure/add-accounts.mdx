---

Adding an account to your New Relic organization is one way to organize and separate data for specific teams or projects. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements for adding an account to your New Relic organization: 

* Pro or Enterprise edition (Standard allows only one account per organization).
* User must be a core user or full platform user with [**Organization settings**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings).
* Organizations with [partnership accounts](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions) must use the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api). 

Some account naming rules: 

* Accounts are identified by their [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id). There are no rules on account name uniqueness within an organization.
* An account name can be a maximum of 255 characters.

## Why add an account? [#why-add-accounts]

For reasons to add accounts, see [Organization and account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).
