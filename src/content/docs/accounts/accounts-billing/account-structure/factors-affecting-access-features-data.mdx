There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data. 

## User permissions [#user-permissions]

User-related settings can impact what features or data you have access to. If you think your user permissions are preventing you from accessing something, talk to your New Relic administrators. 

Potential factors that can affect access include: 

* **Your [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)** (basic, core, or full platform). In most cases, features that are off-limits due to user type will give you a UI message. 
* **Your assigned roles.** How your user roles and permissions work depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) you're on: 
  * New Relic One user model: [learn about how access grants give users access to roles and accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts).
  * Original user model: [learn about roles](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles) and [about account access](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure).  
* **Too many simultaneous logins.** A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.

## Account access [#account-access]

If you're logged in but having trouble finding an expected account or UI page, it may be because you're in the wrong account in your organization. Some tips to troubleshoot this: 

* If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you can switch to another account by going to the account switcher at the top left of most UI pages.
* If you can't find an account or a UI page link doesn't load, it may be for one of these reasons: 
  * You may need to be added to that account. How you do this will depend on your user model: [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#account-access) \| [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure). 
  * You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI displays a note if it detects multiple user records and gives you [an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#verify-email). Other details about multiple logins: 
    * To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select **Remember me** when logging in. 
    * If one of your login options reads "Original account", that means it's a user record on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). 
    * For more information, see this [Explorers Hub post about multiple accounts](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-so-youve-created-a-new-account-and-cant-seem-to-access-your-old-account/113122).

## Billing-related factors [#pricing]

We have two pricing models available, and this can impact feature availability. Pricing plans:

* Our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This newer pricing model gives users broad cross-platform access. For this pricing model, the main factors affecting access are your organization's [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) and a user's [permissions](#user-permissions).
* Our original [product-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for.

We also have several [pricing editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing): Standard, Pro, and Enterprise.

Learn more about our [pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).

## The entities being monitored [#monitored-entities]

Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like:

* Additional UI components, and
* Data available for querying

For example, enabling [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) results in you seeing [trace data in the UI](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-trace-ui) and in having trace data available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

If you are missing data that you expect to see, see [Missing data](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

## Data retention

Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods. Once data has passed a given data retention point, it may be deleted or be aggregated for longer term storage. For details, see [Data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data).
