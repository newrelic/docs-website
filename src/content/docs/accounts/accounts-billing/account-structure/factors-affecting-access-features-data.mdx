There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data. 

## User permissions [#user-permissions]

User-related settings can impact what features or data you have access to. Potential impacts include: 

* Your [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) (basic user or full user).  
* Your assigned roles. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on: 
  * [Original user model roles](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles) 
  * [New Relic One user model roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#roles) 

If you think your permissions are preventing you from accessing something, talk to your New Relic administrators. 

## Account access [#account-access]

If you're having trouble finding an account, here are some causes and solutions: 

* If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you will see an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages that will let you switch between accounts.
* If you're logged into New Relic but can't find an account or its data, it may be for one of these reasons: 
  * You may need to be added to that account. How you do this will depend on your user model: [Original use model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure) \| [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#account-access). 
  * You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI notes if you have multiple user records and gives you [an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts when you log in](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#verify-email). Other details about multiple logins: 
    * To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select **Remember me** when logging in. 
    * If one of your login options reads "Original account", that means it's a user record on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 
    * For more information, see this [Explorers Hub post about multiple accounts](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-so-youve-created-a-new-account-and-cant-seem-to-access-your-old-account/113122).

## Pricing plan or edition [#pricing]

We have two pricing plans available, and this can impact feature availability. Pricing plans:

* Our original [product-based pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for.
* Our [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This newer pricing plan gives more cross-platform access. The main factors affecting access are your [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) and your [user type](/docs/users-roles#user-type).

We also have several Full Stack Observability pricing editions: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise.

Learn more about our [pricing plans](/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).

## The entities being monitored [#monitored-entities]

Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like:

* Additional UI components, and
* Data available for querying

For example, enabling [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) results in you seeing [trace data in the UI](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-trace-ui) and in having trace data available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

If you are missing data that you expect to see, see [Missing data](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

## Data retention

Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods. Once data has passed a given data retention point, it may be deleted or be aggregated for longer term storage. For details, see [Data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data).
