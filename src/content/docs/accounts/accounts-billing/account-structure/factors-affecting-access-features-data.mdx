There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data.

## Permissions-related factors [#user-permissions]

User-related settings can impact the features or data you have access to. If you think your user permissions are preventing you from accessing something, you or your admins should examine your assigned user type, roles, and accounts to understand what you have access to.

Potential permissions-related factors that can affect your access:

### User type [#user-type]

Your [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) (basic, core, or full platform) can affect what you can access. In most cases, features that are off-limits due to user type will show a UI message about that. 

### Assigned roles [#roles]

Your assigned roles can affect what you can access. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) you're on:
  * Our newer user model: [learn about user access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts).
  * Our original user model: [learn about user access](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).

### Pricing edition [#pricing]

We have three pricing editions: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Your edition can affect your access to some features. For more on this, see [Editions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions).


### Exceeding session and IP address limits [#session-limits]

A New Relic user is prohibited from sharing their login with other people. To enforce that rule, we have limits on the number of active sessions and IP addresses that a New Relic user in an organization can have at one time. A New Relic user can have a maximum of three concurrent active sessions in use at any given time, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. (In this context, a session represents a unique login to the New Relic platform. The session is tracked by a token assigned for that session.)

If you exceed the limit, you'll see an `Active session limit reached` message upon login and an option to close open sessions.

For how to configure your users' sessions, see [Session settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more#session-mgmt).  

## Account access and login factors [#account-access]

If you're logged in but can't find an expected account or UI page, it may be because you're in the wrong account in your organization or in the wrong authentication domain in your organization. Some tips:

* If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you can switch to another account by using the [account switcher](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#account-switcher).
* If you have multiple user records (for example, access to more than one New Relic organization), you can [switch between your user records](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found). 
* If you can't find an expected account, it may be because you haven't been assigned access to that account. See [user permissions issues](#user-permissions).
* If you check the account switcher and can't see the account you're looking for, it may be for one of these reasons:
  * You may need to be added to that account. How you do this depends on your user model: [Our newer user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#account-access) \| [Our original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure).
  * You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI displays a note if it detects multiple user records and gives you [an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found). Other details about multiple logins:
    * To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select **Remember me** when logging in.
    * If one of your login options reads "Original account", that means it's a user record on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).
    * For more information, see this [Support Forum post about multiple accounts](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-so-youve-created-a-new-account-and-cant-seem-to-access-your-old-account/113122).

## Error messages for lacking access [#entity-not-found]

You might encounter an error screen in the New Relic UI for one of several reasons, including:

* You don't have [permissions](#user-permissions) to view that account or that UI page (for example, due to [not being assigned to an account](#account-access) or a specific [capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities)).
* A monitored entity wasn't found. This might result in an error like "The entity you're looking for either doesn't exist or isn't associated with your account".

## Data retention

Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods. Once data has passed a given data retention point, it may be deleted or be aggregated for longer term storage. For details, see [Data retention](/docs/manage-stored-data).
