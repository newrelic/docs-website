Some New Relic procedures require use of your account ID (for example, some API calls). Your account ID is the ID number we assign to a New Relic account. Note that [New Relic organizations may contain multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

Some ways to find a New Relic account's ID:

* If your organization has multiple accounts: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page to switch between accounts and see their IDs.
* There are other options, depending on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) you're on:
  * New Relic One user model: Click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), and then go to: **Administration > Access management > Accounts** to see account IDs.
  * Original user model: Click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), click **Account settings**, and then click **API keys**. The account ID is displayed there.

For more on how account access works, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
