Some New Relic procedures require use of an account ID (for example, some API calls). Your account ID is the ID number we assign to a New Relic account. Note that [New Relic organizations may contain multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

Here are two ways to find the ID of a New Relic account:

* If your organization has multiple accounts: From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page to switch between accounts and see their IDs.
* From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), and then go to: **Administration > Access management > Accounts** to see account IDs.

For more on how account access works, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
