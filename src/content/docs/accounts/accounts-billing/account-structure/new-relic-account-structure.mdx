Depending on your user model, you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. We have two models: 

* [New Relic One user model](#new-model)
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure)

<Callout variant="important">
Note that the user model is not directly related to our [two pricing plans](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans).

## New Relic One user model [#new-model]

<Callout variant="important">
This section is about organizations on the New Relic One user model, not the original model. [Learn more about the difference.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) 
</Callout>

At New Relic, an "organization" represents a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything relevant to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data. 

A New Relic "account" can be considered a workspace. For example, you might have an account for a specific app, or a set of related hosts and services for a specific initiative or project, or you might have an account for a specific team. Each account has its own [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id), and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls.

Our [Standard Full Stack Observability edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for a single account per organization. [Pro and Enterprise editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allow for multiple accounts per organization. Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. 

### How users access accounts [#account-access]

In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users’ access to accounts, you create [access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts), which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you may assign a user group the ability to manage billing on some accounts with the [**Billing manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles), and assign some users as non-admin full users on some accounts, and assign some users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that’s a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. [Learn more about user management.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/)

Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn’t granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data.
