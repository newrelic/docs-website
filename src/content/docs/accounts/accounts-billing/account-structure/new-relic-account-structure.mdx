Depending on your [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models), you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. We have two user models:

* [New Relic One user model](#new-model)
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure)

## New Relic One user model [#new-model]

This section is for organizations whose users are on the newer [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models).

At New Relic, an "organization" represents a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything relevant to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data.

When a New Relic organization is created, it contains a single account. A Standard edition organization can only have a single account, but Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can add more accounts. 

Why an organization creates new accounts depends on their goals and structure. There's nothing preventing even quite large companies from having a single account, or a handful of accounts. The fewer accounts you have, the easier it is to see how all your monitored entities relate to each other using our platform. But there can be several reasons to add accounts, such as creating separate accounts for production and non-production environments, or if you want to establish firmer boundaries between different sets of data for any reason. If you're in doubt about why to create accounts, talk to your account representative.

Each account in an organization has its own [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id), and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls.

To add and rename accounts, see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts). 

### How users access accounts [#account-access]

In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users' access to accounts, you create [access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#understand-concepts), which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you might assign a group the ability to manage billing on some accounts using the [**Billing manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles), and assign some users as non-admin full platform users on some accounts, and assign some users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that's a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. [Learn more about user management.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/)

Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn't granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data.

To learn more about access issues, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/).

## Original user model [#original-model]

If your users are still on our original user model, see [Original user model account access](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure).
