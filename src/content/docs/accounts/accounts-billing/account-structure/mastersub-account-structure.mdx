If you have Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can create a more complex account structure with multiple accounts in one organization.

## Requirements [#requirements]

How you manage accounts and users differs based on which account/user model your organization is on. To learn more about the account/user structures, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). The major differences are: 

* New Relic One user model: The [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) includes only one account per organization, and higher editions allow you to have multiple accounts. To add more accounts to your organization, currently you must be helped by a New Relic representative. To add users to accounts, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts). 
* Original user model: You can [create your own sub-accounts](#creating). Keep reading to learn how this account structure works. 
 
## Master and sub-account hierarchy [#hierarchy]

For organizations with multiple accounts, each sub-account is attached to a single master account and can have multiple apps reporting to it. The master account may also have applications reporting to it, but not all data sent from sub-account applications rolls-up into the master account data.

To learn how to switch between accounts in the UI, see [Account access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).

To understand how sub-accounts and master accounts scale with EU region accounts, see [EU region account hierarchy](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center#global-account-hierarchy).

  Master accounts can have their own apps reporting data. However, an app reporting to a sub-account may not report data to a master account.

## License keys for sub-accounts [#keys]

In a New Relic organization, your main New Relic account serves as the master account with its own [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key). Each sub-account has their own individual license keys (and their own [API keys](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key)). Each application can use only one license key, so each application can report to only one account.

## Create sub-accounts [#creating]

To add accounts to your New Relic organization, you must have Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

How to add an account depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) your users are on:

* New Relic One user model: work with your New Relic account representative.
* Original user model: Follow these instructions:
  1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
  2. From **Sub-accounts**, select **Add account**.
  3. Type the sub-account name, then select **Add this account**.
  4. Continue with the procedures to add users to sub-accounts.

## Add users to sub-accounts [#users]

To have a New Relic organization with more than one account, you must have Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

How to add users to a sub-account in your organization depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) your users are on:

* New Relic One user model: you must create an access grant that gives users access to a specific account. To learn more, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#understand-concepts).
* Original user model: In general, permissions for a user on a master account are automatically inherited for that user on sub-accounts. To add users:
  1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
  2. From the master account's **Sub-accounts** list, select the sub-account's link.
  3. From the sub-account's **Active users** section, select **Add user**, fill in the user's email, name, role, and title as appropriate, and then select **Add this user**.
  4. Optional: [Change the Owner or Admin roles](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users) for the sub-account as appropriate.

## Set up accounts with SAML SSO [#saml]

How to set up SAML SSO will depend on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) your users are on:

* Original user model: If you [set up SAML SSO](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/setting-sso) at the master account level, your sub-account users will also be able to sign in using SSO. If you **don't** set SAML SSO at the master level, you can set it at the sub-account level. However, **do not** set SAML SSO at both levels. For more information, see [Configuring SAML with multiple accounts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/configuring-saml-multiple-accounts).
* New Relic One user model: see [SAML SSO](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

## Update sub-account applications [#subaccount_apps]

**Requirements:**

* Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing).
* Your must be on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (if you're on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), you need assistance from New Relic).
* Must be Owner or Admin.

When you change the app's config file to move it from one account to another, New Relic treats it as a new app in the new sub-account. New Relic does not move any historical data for the app.

To install a new app for your sub-account:

1. Make sure you have selected the master account: From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Switch account > (master account)**.
2. Follow standard procedures to install new applications.

   OR

   Change the license key in the existing application's configuration file to move it to another sub-account.
