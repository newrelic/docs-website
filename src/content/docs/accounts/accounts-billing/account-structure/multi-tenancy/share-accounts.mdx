<Callout variant="important">
  If you've set up a low-touch organization structure, this step doesn't apply to you. See the low-touch details in [Step 1: Create accounts and organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/multi-tenancy/org-creation).
</Callout>

Account sharing makes it possible for administrators in a managing organization to make the data they are monitoring visible to their managed organizations. After you've set up the initial account sharing in your high-touch organization structure (see [Create accounts and organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/multi-tenancy/org-creation)), you may find it necessary to make some follow-up changes. 

Let's say you're an administrator in Betty's MSP (a managed service provider) who's monitoring a managed account for your customer Wayne Enterprises. You've also shared that account with the Wayne Enterprises organization. Here are some follow-up tasks you could perform:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="create-share-accounts"
        title="Create and share additional accounts"
    >
      If your customer Wayne Enterprises decides they want another account, here's what you'd do: 
        1. Create another Wayne Enterprises account in your managing organization using the NerdGraph mutation `accountManagementCreateAccount`. 
        2. If Wayne Enterprises also wants to see the data in the new account directly, you'd share that account with their organization using `organizationCreateSharedAccount`.  
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="revoke-access-to-share"
        title="Revoke access to a shared account"
    >
      If you decide there is no longer a need to share an account with your customer Wayne Enterprises, you can revoke the share with the mutation `organizationRevokeSharedAccount`. Note that this mutation requires the Account Share Id to be passed; see [here](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/multi-tenancy/share-accounts/#find-orgs-for-account) for retrieving account share id's.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="update-roles"
        title="Update the roles for a shared account"
    >
      If you need to change the user roles for any of the Wayne Enterprises shared accounts, you can use the mutation `organizationUpdateSharedAccount`. Note that this mutation requires the Account Share Id to be passed; see [here](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/multi-tenancy/share-accounts/#find-orgs-for-account) for retrieving account share id's.

## Requirements [#requirements]

To use this feature, make sure you've completed the following for your organization:

1. Get Approval: Contact your account representative to confirm your organization has been added to multi-tenancy. Once approved, you receive the multi-tenant entitlement.
2. Make sure you have correct user types: Users within the managing org that will leverage the above feature set need to be provisioned as either a core or full platform users.
3. Add users to appropriate group: Users with the core or full platform user type need to be added to a group with `tenant_settings` applied. 

## What can you call in Nerdgraph? [#share-calls]

To help you get acquainted with account sharing, we have some basic examples below. First, take a look at the general routine:

1. The source organization obtains the organization ID from the target organization. You can get the target organization ID from target organization users when they view their **Access Management** tab. 
2. The source organization calls the API and passes the target organization ID, account ID, and limiting role. The source organization can declare a limiting role which defines the maximum capabilities users from the target organization will be restricted to.

Here are the types of calls you can make for account sharing:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="create-a-share"
        title="Create a share"
    >
To use this mutation, you should have already created the target organization. If that isn't in place yet, check out [Step 1: Create accounts and organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/multi-tenancy/org-creation). 

```graphql
mutation {
  organizationCreateSharedAccount(
    sharedAccount: {
      accountId: ACCOUNT_ID_TO_SHARE
      limitingRoleId: 0
      targetOrganizationId: "CUSTOMER_ORGANIZATION_ID_HERE"
    }
  ) {
    sharedAccount {
      accountId
      id
      limitingRoleId
      name
    }
  }
}
```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="revoke-share"
        title="Revoke a share"
    >
```graphql
mutation {
  organizationRevokeSharedAccount(
    sharedAccount: { id: "ID_OF_ACCOUNT_SHARE" }
  ) {
    sharedAccount {
      accountId
      id
      limitingRoleId
      name
      sourceOrganizationId
      sourceOrganizationName
      targetOrganizationId
      targetOrganizationName
    }
  }
}
```

      filter: { accountId: { eq: 1234 } }
      sort: { direction: ASCENDING, key: ACCOUNT_ID }
    ) {
      items {
        accountId
        id
        limitingRole {

Use this mutation to change shared account roles. To find the roles of existing accounts, use the query in [List roles](#list-roles).

```graphql
mutation {
  organizationUpdateSharedAccount(
    sharedAccount: {
      id: "ID_OF_ACCOUNT_SHARE"
      limitingRoleId: NEW_LIMTING_ROLE_ID
    }
  ) {
    sharedAccount {
      accountId
      id
      limitingRoleId
      name
      sourceOrganizationId
      sourceOrganizationName
      targetOrganizationId
      targetOrganizationName
    }
  }
}
```
