Once you [instrument a transaction](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent) using the C SDK, you can instrument [segments](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#segments) in that [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm). By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside of a transaction.

**Example:** You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment.

## Contents [#in-page-toc]

For an index of documentation during the private Beta, see the [C SDK table of contents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/c-agent-table-contents).

## Segment methods

You can work with segments in these ways:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        If you want to monitor calls to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        External services
      </td>

      <td>
        [Instrument external segments](#external-segments)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Arbitrary code
      </td>

      <td>
        [Instrument custom segments](#custom-segments)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Datastores
      </td>

      <td>
        [Instrument datastore segments](#datastore-segments)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        SQL databases
      </td>

      <td>
        [Report slow query traces for datastore segments](#slow-query-datastore)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Instrument calls to external services [#external-segments]

To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the New Relic UI in the [APM **Transactions** page's **Breakdown** table](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems) and the [**External services** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page).

To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor:

1. [Instrument a transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent).
2. Create a `newrelic_external_segment_params_t` struct that describes the external segment.
3. Add the following code immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters described in your [`libnewrelic.h`](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md#getting-started). For more information, see the [New Relic C SDK **Examples/README.md** on GitHub](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/examples/README.md).

   ```
   newrelic_start_external_segment()
   ```
4. Add the following code immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters described in your [`libnewrelic.h`](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md#getting-started). For more information, see the [New Relic C SDK **Examples/README.md** on GitHub](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/examples/README.md).

   ```
   newrelic_end_segment()
   ```

For more information about external segments, see the [New Relic C SDK **GUIDE.md** on GitHub](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md#external-segments).

## Instrument calls to arbitrary code [#datastore-segments]

To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the [APM **Transactions** page's **Breakdown** table](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems).

To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor:

1. [Instrument a transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent).
2. Add the following code immediately before the function you want to monitor:

   ```
   newrelic_start_segment()
   ```
3. Add the following code immediately after the function you want to monitor:

   ```
   newrelic_end_segment()
   ```

For more information, see the [New Relic C SDK **Examples/README.md** on GitHub](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/examples/README.md).

## Instrument calls to datastores [#datastore-segments]

Instrument datastore segments that are within an instrumented transaction to monitor calls to datastores. Datastore segments appear in the **Breakdown** table and **Databases** tab of the [**Transactions** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page) in the New Relic UI. You can also view datastore segments in [New Relic Insights](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights) as a `databaseDuration` attribute of [`Transaction` events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/apm-default-event-attributes#transaction-event).

To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor:

1. [Instrument a transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent).
2. Create a `newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t` struct that describes the datastore segment.
3. Add the following code immediately before the function you want to monitor:

   ```
   newrelic_start_datastore_segment()
   ```
4. Add the following code immediately after the function you want to monitor:

   ```
   newrelic_end_segment()
   ```

## Report slow query traces for datastore segments [#slow-query-datastore]

<Callout variant="important">
  You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only.
</Callout>

To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in the C SDK configuration file:

1. Enable slow query tracing by setting `transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled` to `true`.
2. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to `transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us`.

Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the [**Databases**](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-page) and [**Slow queries**](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/view-slow-query-details) pages in the New Relic UI.

## For more help [#more_help]

Beta support for the C SDK is being handled through [New Relic's Explorers Hub in a private group](https://discuss.newrelic.com/c/support-products-agents/c-agent-pre-release). If you need access to the support group, contact Jodee Varney (Product Manager) at [jvarney@newrelic.com](mailto:jvarney@newrelic.com). Normal support channels will re-route you to the community or the Product Manager.
