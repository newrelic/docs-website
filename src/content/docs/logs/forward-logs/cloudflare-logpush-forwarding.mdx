Configure the [Cloudflare Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/new-relic/) service to send logs to New Relic using the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

<Callout variant="important">
  Cloudflare announced a set of updates to security-related fields in Cloudflare logs that will start being rolled out on February 1st, 2023, and will conclude on August 1st, 2023. Please check the [official Cloudflare announcement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/change-notices/2023-02-01-security-fields-updates/) for more details.

## Manage via Cloudflare dashboard [#dashboard]

To enable a Logpush service to New Relic via the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select the Enterprise domain you want to use with Logpush.

2. Go to **Analytics > Logs**.

3. Click **Connect a service** to open the modal window.

4. Select the dataset you want to push to a storage service.

5. Select the data fields to include in your logs. You can add or remove fields later by modifying your settings in **Logs > Logpush**.

6. Select **New Relic**.

7. Enter New Relic's **Logs Endpoint**. Replace `<NR_LICENSE_KEY>` with your <LicenseKey/>.

   * US: `"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`
   * EU: `"https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

   Other tips:
      * Use the region you set for your New Relic account.
      * Having more than one Cloudflare zone may require a new <LicenseKey/> for each zone.

8. Click **Validate access**.

9. Click **Save and Start Pushing** to finish enabling Logpush.

Once connected, Cloudflare lists New Relic as a connected service under **Logs > Logpush**. Edit or remove connected services from here.

## Manage via Cloudflare API [#api]

### 1. Create a job [#create-job]

To create a job, make a `POST` request to the Logpush jobs endpoint with the following fields:

* `name` (optional): Use your domain name as the job name.
* `logpull_options` (optional): To configure fields, sample rate, and timestamp format, refer to the [Logpush API options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/logpush-api-configuration#options). In order to query Cloudflare logs, New Relic requires fields to be sent as a Unix timestamp.
* `destination_conf`: A log destination consisting of an endpoint URL, a <LicenseKey/>, and a format in the following string format:

  * `<NR_ENDPOINT_URL>`: The New Relic HTTP log ingest endpoint, which is `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1` for US or `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1` for the EU, depending on the region that has been set on your New Relic account.
  * `<NR_LICENSE_KEY>`: Replace with your New Relic <LicenseKey/>, which you can [retrieve from the UI or API](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#manage-license-key).
  * `format`: The format is `cloudflare`.

  For example:
    * US: `"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`
    * EU: `"https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

* `max_upload_records` (optional): The maximum number of log lines per batch. This must be at least 1,000 lines or more. Note that there is no way to specify a minimum number of log lines per batch. This means that log files may contain many fewer lines than specified.
* `max_upload_bytes` (optional): The maximum uncompressed file size of a batch of logs. This must be at least 5 MB. Note that there is no way to set a minimum file size. This means that log files may be much smaller than this batch size. Regardless, we recommend you to set this parameter to 5,000,000.
* `dataset`: The category of logs you want to receive. Refer to [Cloudflare's log fields documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields) for the full list of supported datasets.

Example request using cURL:

```bash
curl -s https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logpush/jobs -X POST -d '
{
  "name": "<DOMAIN_NAME>",
  "logpull_options": "fields=ClientIP,ClientRequestHost,ClientRequestMethod,ClientRequestURI,EdgeEndTimestamp,EdgeResponseBytes,EdgeResponseStatus,EdgeStartTimestamp,RayID&timestamps=unix",
  "destination_conf": "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
  "max_upload_bytes": 5000000,
  "dataset": "http_requests",
  "enabled": true
}' \
-H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
-H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" | jq .
```

Response:

```bash
{
  "errors" : [],
  "messages" : [],
  "result" : {
      "dataset" : "http_requests",
      "destination_conf" : "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
      "enabled" : true,
      "error_message" : null,
      "frequency" : "high",
      "id" : 100,
      "kind" : "",
      "last_complete" : null,
      "last_error" : null,
      "logpull_options" : "fields=ClientIP,ClientRequestHost,ClientRequestMethod,ClientRequestURI,EdgeEndTimestamp,EdgeResponseBytes,EdgeResponseStatus,EdgeStartTimestamp,RayID&timestamps=unix",
      "logstream" : true,
      "max_upload_bytes" : 5000000,
      "name" : "<DOMAIN_NAME>"
  },
  "success" : true
}
```

### 2. Enable (update) a job [#enable]

To enable a job, make a `PUT` request to the Logpush jobs endpoint. Use the job ID returned from the previous step in the URL and send `{"enabled": true}` in the request body.

Example request using cURL:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logpush/jobs/100 -d'{"enabled":true}' \
-H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
-H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" | jq .
```

Response:

```bash
{
  "errors" : [],
  "messages" : [],
  "result" : {
      "dataset" : "http_requests",
      "destination_conf" : "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
      "enabled" : true,
      "error_message" : null,
      "frequency" : "high",
      "id" : 100,
      "kind" : "",
      "last_complete" : "null",
      "last_error" : null,
      "logpull_options" : "fields=ClientIP,ClientRequestHost,ClientRequestMethod,ClientRequestURI,EdgeEndTimestamp,EdgeResponseBytes,EdgeResponseStatus,EdgeStartTimestamp,RayID&timestamps=unix",
      "logstream" : true,
      "max_upload_bytes" : 5000000,
      "name" : "<DOMAIN_NAME>"
  },
  "success" : true
}
```

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Cloudflare Logpush documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/faq/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
