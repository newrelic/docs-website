If your log data is already being monitored by [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), you can use our Fluent Bit output plugin to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic.

Forwarding your Fluent Bit logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Basic process [#compatibility-requirements]

We have published a container with the plugin installed. It serves as a base image to be used by our Kubernetes integration. We recommend you use this base image and layer your own custom configuration files.

To forward logs to New Relic with Fluent Bit:

1. Make sure you have:
  * A [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key)
  * Fluent Bit 1.0 or higher (recommended), although v0.12 or higher is supported
2. [Install](#fluentbit-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
3. [Configure](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
4. [Test](#test-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
5. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## Install the Fluent Bit plugin [#fluentbit-plugin]

To install the Fluent Bit plugin:

1. Navigate to New Relic's [Fluent Bit plugin repository on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output).
2. From the repository page, [clone or download the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).
3. Run the following command to build your plugin:
```
cd newrelic-fluent-bit-output && make all
```
4. Store `out_newrelic.so` or `out_newrelic_winXX.dll` at a location that can be accessed by the `fluent-bit` daemon.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you'd rather not compile the plugin yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions from our [GitHub repository's releases page](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases).
</Callout>

## Configure the Fluent Bit plugin [#configure-plugin]

Fluent Bit needs to know the location of the New Relic plugin and the New Relic license key to output data to New Relic. To configure your Fluent Bit plugin:

<Callout variant="important">
  Pay attention to white space when editing your config files. Be sure to use four spaces to indent and one space between keys and values.
</Callout>

1. Locate or create a `plugins.conf` file in your plugins directory.
2. In the `plugins.conf` file, add a reference to `out_newrelic.so`, adjacent to your `fluent-bit.conf` file:

   ```
   [PLUGINS]
       Path <var>/PATH/TO/</var>newrelic-fluent-bit-output/out_newrelic.so
   ```
3. In the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following line under the `service` block:

   ```
   [SERVICE]
   # This is the main configuration block for fluent bit.
   # Ensure the follow line exists somewhere in the SERVICE block
   Plugins_File plugins.conf
   ```
4. At the bottom of the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following to set up the input and output filters. Replace the placeholder text with your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key):

   ```
   [INPUT]
       Name tail
       Path <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>

   [OUTPUT]
       Name newrelic
       Match *
       licenseKey <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>

   # Optional
   maxBufferSize 256000
   maxRecords 1024
   ```
5. Restart your Fluent Bit instance with the following command:

   ```
   fluent-bit -c <var>/PATH/TO/</var>fluent-bit.conf
   
   ```

## Test the Fluent Bit plugin [#test-plugin]

To test if your Fluent Bit plugin is receiving input from a log file:

1. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

   ```
   echo "test message" >> <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>
   ```
2. Search the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for `test message`.

## Associate logs with entities [#associate-logs-entities] 

To associate a log line with an [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), such as an infrastructure host, add a `FILTER` block:

```
[FILTER]
  Name modify
  Match * # Or specify a match
  Add entity.guids <Your Entity GUID ID> # Optional
  Add hostname <Your hostname> # Optional
```

For more options, see the [Fluent Bit modify filter documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify) and our documentation to [forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#automatically-inserted-attributes).

## Optional: Configure plugin attributes [#instrument-plugin]

Once you have [installed](#fluentbit-plugin) and [configured](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Key
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `licenseKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        The [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). Use either `licenseKey` (**recommended**) or `apiKey`, not both. Default: `none`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxBufferSize`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum size the payloads sent, in bytes. Default: `256000`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxRecords`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum number of records to send at a time. Default: `1024`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `apiKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        **Deprecated.** Takes a New Relic [Insights insert key](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api#register), but using the `licenseKey` attribute is preferred. Use either `licenseKey` or `apiKey`, not both.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with the [New Relic One UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
