If your log data is already being monitored by [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), you can use our Fluent Bit output plugin to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic.

Forwarding your Fluent Bit logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Basic process [#compatibility-requirements]

We have published a container with the plugin installed. It serves as a base image to be used by our Kubernetes integration. We recommend you use this base image and layer your own custom configuration files.

To forward your logs from Fluent Bit to New Relic:

1. Make sure you have:
   * A New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />
   * Fluent Bit 1.0 or higher (recommended), although v0.12 or higher is supported
   * Fluent Bit Windows install directions can be found [here](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/windows)
   * Fluent Bit Linux install directions can be found [here](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/linux)
2. [Install](#fluentbit-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
3. [Configure](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
4. [Test](#test-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
5. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## Install the Fluent Bit plugin [#fluentbit-plugin]

To install the Fluent Bit plugin:

1. Navigate to New Relic's [Fluent Bit plugin repository on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output).
2. From the repository page, [clone or download the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).
3. Run the following command to build your plugin:

```
cd newrelic-fluent-bit-output && make all
```

4. Store `out_newrelic.so` or `out_newrelic_winXX.dll` at a location that can be accessed by the `fluent-bit` daemon.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you'd rather not compile the plugin yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions from our [GitHub repository's releases page](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases).
</Callout>

## Configure the Fluent Bit plugin [#configure-plugin]

Fluent Bit needs to know the location of the New Relic plugin and the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> to output data to New Relic. To configure your Fluent Bit plugin:

<Callout variant="important">
  Pay attention to white space when editing your config files. Be sure to use four spaces to indent and one space between keys and values.
</Callout>

1. Locate or create a `plugins.conf` file in your plugins directory.
2. In the `plugins.conf` file, add a reference to `out_newrelic.so`, adjacent to your `fluent-bit.conf` file:

   ```
   [PLUGINS]
       Path /PATH/TO/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/out_newrelic.so
   ```
3. In the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following line under the `service` block:

   ```
   [SERVICE]
   # This is the main configuration block for fluent bit.
   # Ensure the follow line exists somewhere in the SERVICE block
   Plugins_File plugins.conf
   ```
4. At the bottom of the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following to set up the input, filter, and output stanzas. Replace the placeholder text with your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />:

   ```
   [INPUT]
       Name tail
       Tag my.tag
       Path /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE

   # having multiple [FILTER] blocks allows one to control the flow of changes as they read top down. 
   [FILTER]
       Name modify
       # here we only match on one tag, my.tag, defined in the [INPUT] section earlier
       Match my.tag
       # below, we're renaming the host.cpu attribute to CPU
       Rename host.cpu CPU

   [FILTER]
       Name record_modifier
       # match on all tags, *, so all logs get decorated per the Record clauses below. Record adds attributes + their values to each record.
       Match *
       # adding a logtype attribute ensures your logs will be automatically parsed by our built-in parsing rules
       Record logtype nginx
       # add the server's hostname to all logs generated
       Record hostname ${HOSTNAME}

   [OUTPUT]
       Name newrelic
       Match *
       licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY

   # Optional
   maxBufferSize 256000
   maxRecords 1024
   ```
5. Restart your Fluent Bit instance with the following command:

   ```
   fluent-bit -c /PATH/TO/fluent-bit.conf

   ```

<InstallFeedback />

## Test the Fluent Bit plugin [#test-plugin]

To test if your Fluent Bit plugin is receiving input from a log file:

1. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

   ```
   echo "test message" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE
   ```
2. Search our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for `test message`.

For more options, see the [Fluent Bit modify filter documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify) and our documentation to [forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#automatically-inserted-attributes).

## Optional: Configure plugin attributes [#instrument-plugin]

Once you have [installed](#fluentbit-plugin) and [configured](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Key
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `licenseKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        The <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. Use either `licenseKey` (**recommended**) or `apiKey`, not both. Default: `none`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxBufferSize`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum size the payloads sent, in bytes. Default: `256000`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxRecords`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum number of records to send at a time. Default: `1024`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `apiKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        **Deprecated.** Takes a New Relic [Insights insert key](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api#register), but using the `licenseKey` attribute is preferred. Use either `licenseKey` or `apiKey`, not both.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Fluent Bit documentation](https://fluentbit.io/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
