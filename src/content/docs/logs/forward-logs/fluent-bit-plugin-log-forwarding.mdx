New Relic offers a [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) output plugin to connect your Fluent Bit monitored log data to [New Relic](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs). Read on to learn how to enable this feature.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use New Relic Logs with Fluent Bit, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
* Fluent Bit 0.12 or higher is supported; however, version 1.0 or higher is recommended.

## Enable Fluent Bit for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your logs to New Relic using Fluent Bit:

1. [Install](#fluentbit-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
2. [Configure](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
3. [Test](#test-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin.
4. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## Recommended usage [#recommened-usage]

We have published a container with the plugin installed. It serves as a base image to be used by our Kubernetes integration. We recommend you use this base image and layer your own custom configuration files.

## Install the Fluent Bit plugin [#fluentbit-plugin]

To install the Fluent Bit plugin:

1. Navigate to New Relic's [Fluent Bit plugin repository on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output).
2. From the repository page, [clone or download the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).
3. Run the following command to build your plugin:

   ```
   cd newrelic-fluent-bit-output && make all
   ```
4. Make sure to store `out_newrelic.so` or `out_newrelic_winXX.dll` at a location that can be accessed by the fluent-bit daemon.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you'd rather not compile the plugin yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions from our repository's [releases page](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases).
</Callout>

## Configure the Fluent Bit plugin [#configure-plugin]

Fluent Bit needs to know the location of the New Relic plugin and the [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) to output data to New Relic. To configure your Fluent Bit plugin:

<Callout variant="important">
  Pay attention to white space when editing your config files. Be sure to use four spaces to indent and one space between keys and values.
</Callout>

1. Locate or create a `plugins.conf` file in your plugins directory.
2. In the `plugins.conf` file, add a reference to `out_newrelic.so`, adjacent to your `fluent-bit.conf` file:

   ```
   [PLUGINS]
       Path <var>/PATH/TO/</var>newrelic-fluent-bit-output/out_newrelic.so
   ```
3. In the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following line under the `service` block:

   ```
   [SERVICE]
   # This is the main configuration block for fluent bit.
   # Ensure the follow line exists somewhere in the SERVICE block
   Plugins_File plugins.conf
   ```
4. At the bottom of the `fluent-bit.conf` file, add the following to set up the input and output filters. Replace the placeholder text with your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key):

   ```
   [INPUT]
       Name tail
       Path <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>

   [OUTPUT]
       Name newrelic
       Match *
       licenseKey <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>

   # Optional
   maxBufferSize 256000
   maxRecords 1024
   ```
5. Restart your Fluent Bit instance with the following command:

   ```
   fluent-bit -c <var>/PATH/TO/</var>fluent-bit.conf
   
   ```

## Test the Fluent Bit plugin [#test-plugin]

To test if your Fluent Bit plugin is receiving input from a log file:

1. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

   ```
   echo "test message" >> <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>
   ```
2. Search [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for `test message`.

## Associate logs with entities [#associate-logs-entities] 

To associate a log line with an [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), such as an infrastructure host, add a `FILTER` block:

```
[FILTER]
  Name modify
  Match * # Or specify a match
  Add entity.guids <Your Entity GUID ID> # Optional
  Add hostname <Your hostname> # Optional
```

For more options, visit [Fluent Bit modify filter documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify) and [Forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#automatically-inserted-attributes).

## Optional: Configure plugin attributes [#instrument-plugin]

### Plugin configuration [#plugin-attributes]

Once you have [installed](#fluentbit-plugin) and [configured](#configure-plugin) the Fluent Bit plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Key**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `licenseKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        The [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). Use either `licenseKey` (**recommended**) or `apiKey`, not both.

        Default: `none`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxBufferSize`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum size the payloads sent, in bytes.

        Default: `256000`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `maxRecords`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum number of records to send at a time.

        Default: `1024`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `apiKey`
      </td>

      <td>
        Deprecated. Takes a New Relic [Insights insert key](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api#register) but use of `licenseKey` attribute is preferred. Use either `licenseKey` or `apiKey`, not both.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable New Relic Logs, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
