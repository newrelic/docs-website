Use New Relic to analize and storage the ingested logs from your Vercel projects and traces from your serverless functions.

You can install the [Vercel quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/vercel) to get a pre-built dashboard and alert to monitor the performance of your functions.

## Prerequisites [#pre-req]

To deploy on Vercel, you need to create a project, which groups deployments and custom domains. Learn how to set up and configure projects by reading the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview).

## Vercel configuration [#configuration]

Follow these easy steps to integrate your Vercel project and start sending logs.

## Install the Vercel quickstart dashboard [#vercel-quickstart]

After you've sent Vercel data to New Relic, the Vercel quickstart is the fastest way to jump straight into monitoring your end-to-end development logs.

Install the quickstart to get a pre-built dashboard and alert to monitor the performance of your functions. You'll also get a pre-built alert that triggers when the error rate (4xx/5xx errors) exceeds 1%. Follow these instructions:

1. Go to the [Vercel quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/vercel) in New Relic Instant Observability and click **Install now**.
2. Select an account and click **Begin installation**.
3. If you've already completed the [Vercel configuration steps](#configuration), select **Done** to move onto the next step.
4. The quickstart deploys the resources to your account. Click **See your data** to get to the dashboard.

The Vercel quickstart dashboard visualizes all your key data into three pages. Click the **Overview**, **Build Logs**, and **Serverless Function** tabs to get an overview, analyze build logs, and dive deep into your Serverless Function performance.

## Optional: Get trace data from Vercel with OpenTelemetry [#vercel-opentelemetry]

You can use [OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction/) to import trace data from your applications running in Vercel functions. To set this option, follow these steps:

1. After clicking **Add integration** in the [step 5](#step5) in the [Vercel configuration](#configuration), you'll see the configuration details dialog box.

2. Go to the **Traces (Beta)** section and toggle it on to enable the traces.

3. Click **Save changes**.

    alt="Get trace data from Vercel with OpenTelemetry"
    src={logsVercelGetTraceData}
  />

4. After you've enabled the traces, you'll see them in New Relic. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**. Then, under the **Monitor** section, click **Distributed tracing**.

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/log-drains-overview/log-drains#removing-a-log-drain). You don't need to do anything else in New Relic.
