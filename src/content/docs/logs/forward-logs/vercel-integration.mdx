Use New Relic to analyze and store the ingested logs from your Vercel projects and traces from your serverless functions.

You can install the [Vercel quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/vercel) to get a pre-built dashboard and alert to monitor the performance of your functions.

## Prerequisites [#pre-req]

To deploy on Vercel, you need to create a project which will group your deployments and custom domains. Learn how to set up and configure projects by reading the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview).

## Vercel configuration [#configuration]

Follow these easy steps to integrate your Vercel project and start sending logs:

## Install the Vercel quickstart dashboard [#vercel-quickstart]

After you've sent Vercel data to New Relic, the Vercel quickstart is the fastest way to jump straight into monitoring your end-to-end development logs.

Install the quickstart to get a pre-built dashboard and alert to monitor the performance of your functions. You'll also get a pre-built alert that triggers when the error rate (4xx/5xx errors) exceeds 1%. Follow these instructions:

1. Go to the [Vercel quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/vercel) in New Relic Instant Observability and click <DNT>**Install now**</DNT>.
2. Select an account and click <DNT>**Begin installation**</DNT>.
3. If you've already completed the [Vercel configuration steps](#configuration), select <DNT>**Done**</DNT> to move onto the next step.
4. The quickstart deploys the resources to your account. Click <DNT>**See your data**</DNT> to get to the dashboard.

The Vercel quickstart dashboard visualizes all your key data into three pages. Click the <DNT>**Overview**</DNT>, <DNT>**Build Logs**</DNT>, and <DNT>**Serverless Function**</DNT> tabs to get an overview, analyze build logs, and dive deep into your Serverless Function performance.

## Optional: Get trace data from Vercel with OpenTelemetry [#vercel-opentelemetry]

You can use [OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction/) to import trace data from your applications running in Vercel functions. To set this option, follow these steps:

1. After clicking <DNT>**Add integration**</DNT> in [step 5](#step5) in the [Vercel configuration](#configuration), you'll see the configuration details dialog box.

2. Go to the <DNT>**Traces (Beta)**</DNT> section and toggle it on to enable the traces.

3. Click <DNT>**Save changes**</DNT>.

     alt="Get trace data from Vercel with OpenTelemetry"
     src="/images/logs_screenshot-crop_vercel-get-trace-data.webp"
   />

4. After you've enabled the traces, you'll see them in New Relic. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**</DNT>. Then, under the <DNT>**Monitor**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>.

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/log-drains-overview/log-drains#removing-a-log-drain). You don't need to do anything else in New Relic.
