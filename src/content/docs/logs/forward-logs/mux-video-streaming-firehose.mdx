Forward your Mux Video Streaming logs into New Relic using Kinesis Firehose to get full observability on your video streaming.

## Steps to Stream Mux Video data to New Relic[#mux-kinesis-stream]

1. You will need to have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> ready.

2. Follow the [documentation](https://docs.mux.com/guides/system/export-amazon-kinesis-data-streams) to set up a data stream to get Mux data to Amazon Kinesis.

3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and configure it to send the Mux data into New Relic. Check out [our documentation](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose/) to for steps to set up a Kinesis Firehose stream.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our [NRQL query tools](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM Log
    ```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Kinesis Data Firehose documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
