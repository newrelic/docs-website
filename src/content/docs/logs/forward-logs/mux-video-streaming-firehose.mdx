metaDescription: 'Install and configure New Relic logging for Mux Video Streaming via Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, so you can use our enhanced log management capabilities.'

Forward your Mux Video Streaming logs into New Relic using Kinesis Firehose to get full observability on your video streaming.

## Steps to Stream Mux Video data to New Relic[#mux-kinesis-stream]

1. You will need to have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> ready.

2. Follow the [documentation](https://docs.mux.com/guides/system/export-amazon-kinesis-data-streams) to set up a data stream to get Mux data to Amazon Kinesis.

3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and configure it to send the Mux data into New Relic. Check out [our documentation](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose/) to for steps to set up a Kinesis Firehose stream.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic's Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Kinesis Data Firehose documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
