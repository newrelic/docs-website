If your log data is already being monitored by [Vector](https://vector.dev/), you can use our [Vector output sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/new_relic_logs/) to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic.

Forwarding your Vector logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Configure the Vector New Relic logs sink [#configure-sink]

To forward your logs from Vector to New Relic:

1. Make sure you have:
* A [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key)
* Vector version 0.7.0 or higher
2. Follow the procedures to [configure the Vector logs sink for New Relic](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/new_relic_logs/).
3. Add a snippet to your `vector.toml` file (located in `/etc/vector` by default), replacing <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var> with your New Relic license key:

  ```
  # Ingest data by tailing one or more files

    [sources.mylog]
      type = "file"
      include = ["/path/to/file"] # Specify file or files to be tailed
      ignore_older = 86400 # Ignore events older than 1 day
      file_key = "file" # Add filename to log events
      host_key = "host" # Add hostname to log events
  
  # Configure sink to forward events to New Relic Logs

    [sinks.new_relic_logs]
      # REQUIRED
      type = "new_relic_logs" # must be: "new_relic_logs"
      inputs = ["mylog"] # example - value must be one or more source IDs
      license_key = "<var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>"
      region = "us" # Enum, must be one of: "us" "eu" depending on your New Relic Logs account region
      encoding.codec = "json"
  
  # OPTIONAL
    healthcheck = true # default
  ```

2. Restart the Vector service to ensure your changes are applied.

## Test the Vector New Relic logs sink [#test-sink]

To test if the New Relic logs sink is forwarding events:

1. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

  ```
  echo "test message" >> <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>
  ```

2. Search [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for your test message.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with the [New Relic One UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
