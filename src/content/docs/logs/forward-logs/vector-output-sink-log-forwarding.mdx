Use our Vector [output sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/new_relic_logs/) to connect your Vector-monitored log data to New Relic. Read on to learn how to configure and test the Vector New Relic logs sink.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

To forward your logs to New Relic using Vector, you'll need:

* A [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) 
* Vector version 0.7.0 or higher

## Configure the Vector New Relic Logs sink [#configure-sink]

To configure the Vector [New Relic logs sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/new_relic_logs/):

1. Add a snippet to your `vector.toml` file (located in `/etc/vector` by default), replacing <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var> with the [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key):

       ```
       # Ingest data by tailing one or more files

       [sources.mylog]
         type = "file"
         include = ["/path/to/file"] # Specify file or files to be tailed
         ignore_older = 86400 # Ignore events older than 1 day
         file_key = "file" # Add filename to log events
         host_key = "host" # Add hostname to log events

       # Configure sink to forward events to New Relic Logs

       [sinks.new_relic_logs]
         # REQUIRED
         type = "new_relic_logs" # must be: "new_relic_logs"
         inputs = ["mylog"] # example - value must be one or more source IDs
         license_key = "<var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>"
         region = "us" # Enum, must be one of: "us" "eu" depending on your New Relic Logs account region
         encoding.codec = "json"

         # OPTIONAL
         healthcheck = true # default
       ```
2. Restart the Vector service to ensure your changes are applied.

## Test the Vector New Relic logs sink [#test-sink]

To test if the New Relic logs sink is forwarding events:

1. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

   ```
   echo "test message" >> <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>
   ```
2. Search [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for your test message.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable New Relic Logs, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
