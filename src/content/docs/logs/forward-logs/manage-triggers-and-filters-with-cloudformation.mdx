When you deploy a CloudFormation stack, it creates triggers on an S3 bucket and filters on a CloudWatch log group. Deleting the stack will remove these triggers and filters.

If you manually create triggers in an S3 bucket or filters on CloudWatch log groups and set the destination as a Lambda function created by New Relic, these are also supported. However, we do not recommend this approach. Deleting the stack will not remove these manually created triggers or filters, as the stack does not have permission to delete them.

This guidance is important to ensure effective resource management and to prevent unintended triggers or filters from remaining after a stack deletion.
