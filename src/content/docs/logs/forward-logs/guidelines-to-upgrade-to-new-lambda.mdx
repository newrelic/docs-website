If you want to upgrade from the old Lambda to the new one, we recommend deleting the previously deployed New Relic S3 Lambda and CloudWatch Lambda. Alternatively, you can delete the previously created triggers before deploying the new one.

If you choose to use both solutions, ensure there are no duplicate triggers to avoid sending duplicate logs from the same resource. We do not recommend this, as it may cause reaching S3 and CloudWatch limits on reading logs, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data reaching New Relic.
