You can send your [Amazon S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, `NewRelic-log-ingestion-s3`. This can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository.

Forwarding logs from your S3 bucket to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Install the Lambda function [#install-function]

To install the Lambda function to forward your S3 logs to New Relic:

1. Make sure you have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
2. Open the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications) in your browser.
3. Make sure that the Lambda is installed in the same region as the S3 bucket.
   <img title="AWS Lambda - Select region" alt="AWS Lambda - Select region" src={serverlessAWSLambdaSelectRegion}/>
4. Search for `newrelic` and check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** to find `NewRelic-log-ingestion-s3`.
5. Click the `NewRelic-log-ingestion-s3` details and click **Deploy**.
6. Scroll to the **Application settings** and enter your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
7. Take advantage of New Relic's log parsing capabilities by specifying the `logtype` as an environment variable for the Lambda function. For more information, see [Built-in parsing rulesets](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing#built-in-rules).
8. Confirm that the app creates custom IAM roles, and then click **Deploy.**
9. Once the function is deployed, [create a Lambda trigger](#create-trigger).

### Manual install using Serverless Framework [#serverless-install]

You can manually install and configure the Lambda from the terminal using the [Serverless](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless) Framework. If you're not on Linux, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first and keep it running.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/aws_s3_log_ingestion_lambda.git
# Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless">Serverless</a> and the repo dependencies
npm install -g serverless
npm install
# Set the New Relic License Key env variable
export LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY
# Set the logtype (optional)
export LOG_TYPE=YOUR_LOGTYPE
# Set the S3 bucket name
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
# The S3 subdirectory (optional)
export S3_PREFIX=YOUR_S3_SUBDIRECTORY
# Choose a name for your new Serverless Framework service
export SERVICE_NAME=YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
# Deploy the function, specifying the same region as your S3 bucket listed above
serverless deploy --region YOUR_AWS_REGION
```

## Create a Lambda trigger in AWS [#create-trigger]

To get your logs streaming to New Relic, attach a trigger to the Lambda:

1. In the left side menu, click **Functions**.
2. Find and select the previously created `NewRelic-s3-log-ingestion` function.
3. Under **Designer**, click **Add Triggers** and select **S3** from the dropdown.
4. Select the S3 bucket that contains the log you want to send to New Relic.
5. Optionally configure a [prefix and suffix](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/amazon-s3-adds-prefix-and-suffix-filters-for-lambda-function-triggering/). This is helpful if your logs are in a subdirectory.
6. Check the **Enable trigger** checkbox, then **Add** the trigger.

To test the Lambda function, upload a new log file to the S3 bucket you configured in the function settings and then [view your log data](#find-data).

## Limitations [#limitations]

* The maximum supported log file size is 35 MB uncompressed.
* The maximum supported individual log line size is 0.25 MB.
* Encrypted log files are not supported.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data).

For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="config-overlap"
    title="Configuration overlap"
  >
    When deploying the Lambda function, this error may occur:

    ```
    An error occurred when creating the trigger: Configurations overlap. Configurations on the same bucket cannot share a common event type.
    ```

    To solve this issue, make sure the bucket doesn't have another event of the same type. Your S3 bucket can't have multiple instances of **All object create events**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="cannot-connect"
    title="Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"
  >
    When using Serverless to deploy the Lambda function from your machine, this error may occur:

    ```
    Error: docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
    ```

    This may mean that either Docker isn't running or that it hasn't been correctly set up. Make sure Docker is running on your machine when deploying the Lambda function using Serverless.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="no-data"
    title="No data appears"
  >
    If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore [logging data across your platform](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
