The Azure Resources Manager (ARM) template provided by New Relic One helps you:

* [Set up Azure to forward logs from EventHub to New Relic One](#application-logs).
* [Set up Azure Activity Logs forwarding to New Relic One through EventHub](#activity-logs).

The setup process is almost the same for both use cases, but take a look at step 9 if you want to forward [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) to New Relic.

On the other hand, the template is idempotent. You can start forwarding logs from EventHub and then re-run the same template to configure [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) forwarding by completing step 9 listed below.

## Requirements [#requirements]

- A New Relic [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).

## Use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template [#using-the-template]

1. Login to [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) and click **Add more data sources** on the top right of the page.
2. Under **Log ingestion**, click on the ![Add more data sources button](./images/azure-tile.png) tile.
3. Select the account you want to send the logs from the selector, and click **Continue**.
4. Click **Generate API Key** and copy the generated **API Key**.
5. Click **Deploy to Azure** and a new tab will be open with the ARM template loaded in Azure.
6. Select the **Resource Group** in which you want to create the necessary resources, and a **Region**.
7. In the **New Relic License Key** field, paste the previously copied **API Key**.
8. Ensure the New Relic One endpoint set is the one corresponding to your account.
9. Optionally, set to true the [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) you want to forward from the following list:
  * Administrative Azure Activity Logs
  * Alert Azure Activity Logs
  * Autoscale Azure Activity Logs
  * Policy Azure Activity Logs
  * Recommendation Azure Activity Logs
  * Resource Health Azure Activity Logs
  * Security Azure Activity Logs
  * Service Health Azure Activity Logs
10. Click **Review + create**, review the data you've inserted, and click **Create**.

## View log data [#find-data]

Once logs are streaming you can view them using:

* [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) - Search for `plugin.type:"azure"` if you have more logs sources and want to check only the ones coming from Azure.
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can run a query like:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If you want to only query for logs coming from Azure, run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM Log where plugin.type='azure'
```

## Send logs from Azure resources [#application-logs]

By default, this template only configures the needed function and resources to forward logs to New Relic One. We can also configure the activity logs to be forwarded, but there isn't a default log forwarding from your Azure resources. If you want to forward logs from any resource that produces them, you need to configure it by creating a diagnostic setting for the given resource.

As an example, if you have a function running on Azure and you want to forward the logs to New Relic One, you'll need to configure a diagnostic setting to forward the logs to the configure EventHub. Read how to [create diagnostic settings to send platform logs and metrics to different destinations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=CMD).

## Azure Activity Logs [#activity-logs]

Activating the Azure Activity Logs forwarding is optional and it provides:

- More visibility of your Azure resources
- Activity of the Azure resources
- Information about performed actions
- Events and their timestamps
- The user who performed an action, if applicable

These logs allow your company to have more control over the resources, be aware of wrong or unintentional changes on your resources and even unexpected actions. You can read more about this kind of event on the [Azure Activity Log event schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled **Logs**, you can:

* Take a look at how the New Relic One ARM template and Azure function works in the [newrelic-azure-functions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions) repository.
* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
