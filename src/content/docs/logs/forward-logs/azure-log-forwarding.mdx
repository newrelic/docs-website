If your logs are already being collected in Azure, you can use our [Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) templates to forward and enrich them in New Relic.

Forwarding your Azure logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

We currently offer two ARM templates to achieve this: the EventHub-based (recommended) and the Blob Storage-based templates.

## Send logs from an Azure Event Hub (recommended) [#azure-eventhub]

The [New Relic Event Hub ARM template](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/armTemplates/azuredeploy-eventhubforwarder.json) allows you to attach a consumer to an existing or new Event Hub to forward the incoming stream of logs to New Relic. By using this setup, you can configure multiple Azure resources to send their logs to an Event Hub and have these logs automatically forwarded to New Relic. The template also allows you to easily configure your **subscription** Activity Logs to be sent to New Relic.

To send the logs from your Event Hub:

1. [Deploy](#eventhub-arm-setup) the New Relic Event Hub ARM template.
2. Optional: [configure your **subscription** Activity Logs to be sent to New Relic](#subscription-activity-logs).
3. Optional: [configure a given Azure resource to send its individual Activity Logs](#resource-activity-logs).
4. [Explore your log data](#find-data).

### Deploy the New Relic Event Hub ARM template [#eventhub-arm-setup]

Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
2. Log in to **[one.newrelic.com > Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) > Add more data sources** on the top right of the page.
3. Under **Log ingestion**, click the `Microsoft Azure Event Hub` tile:
4. Select the account you want to send the logs, and click **Continue**.
5. Click **Generate API Key** and copy the generated API key.
6. Click **Deploy to Azure** and a new tab will be open with the ARM template loaded in Azure.
7. Select the **Resource Group** where you want to create the necessary resources, and a **Region**. Despite not being mandatory, we recommend installing the template in a new resource group, to avoid deleting any of the components it creates accidentally.
8. In the **New Relic License Key** field, paste the previously copied API key.
9. Ensure the [New Relic endpoint](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint) is set to the one corresponding to your account.
10. Optional: Set to `true` the [Azure subscription activity logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) you want to forward. See [the subscription information](#subscription-activity-logs) in this document for more details.
11. Click **Review + create**, review the data you've inserted, and click **Create**.

Note that the template is idempotent. You can start forwarding logs from Event Hub and then rerun the same template to configure [Azure Subscription Activity Logs](#subscription-activity-logs) forwarding by completing step 10.

<InstallFeedback />

### Optional: Send Azure Activity Logs from your subscription [#subscription-activity-logs]

[Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) provide:

* More visibility of your Azure resources
* Activity of the Azure resources
* Information about performed actions
* Events and their timestamps
* The user who performed an action, if applicable

These are all subscription-level events. If you wish to forward Activity Logs from a specific resource instead, please refer to the [Resource Activity Logs information](#resource-activity-logs) in this document.

For more information about the shape of the Activity Logs, see the [Microsoft Azure Activity Log event schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

The [New Relic Event Hub ARM template deployment](#eventhub-arm-setup) optionally allows you to select which [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) you want to forward to New Relic, including:

* Administrative Azure Activity Logs
* Alert Azure Activity Logs
* Autoscale Azure Activity Logs
* Policy Azure Activity Logs
* Recommendation Azure Activity Logs
* Resource Health Azure Activity Logs
* Security Azure Activity Logs
* Service Health Azure Activity Logs

### Optional: configure an Azure resource to send its Activity Logs [#resource-activity-logs]

By default, this template only configures the function and resources needed to forward logs from an Event Hub to New Relic. We can also configure the subscription Activity Logs to be forwarded, but there isn't a default log forwarding from your Azure resources. If you want to forward logs from any resource that produces them, you need to configure it by creating a diagnostic setting for the given resource.

For example, if you have a function running on Azure and you want to forward the logs to New Relic, you'll need to configure a diagnostic setting to forward the logs to Event Hub. For more information, see the [Microsoft documentation to create diagnostic settings for sending platform logs and metrics to different destinations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=CMD).

In the following example, we will demonstrate how to forward the Activity Logs from a Kubernetes Service resource running on Azure.

1. [Deploy the New Relic Event Hub ARM template](#eventhub-arm-setup).
2. Navigate to your Kubernetes service:

<img
  alt="Kubernetes Service Button"
  src={serverlessAzureEventHubK8sService}
/>

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Monitoring`>`Diagnostic Settings**:

<img
  alt="Diagnostic Settings menu"
  src={serverlessAzureEventHubDiagnosticSettings}
/>

4. Click **Add diagnostic setting**.
5. In the **Diagnostic setting name** field, give your new setting a meaningful name.
6. Select the Kubernetes (control pane) logs you want to collect (for example, `kube-apiserver`, `kube-audit`, `kube-scheduler`).
7. On the **Destination details**, select **Stream to an event hub**, and configure the `Event hub namespace`, `Event hub name`, and `Event hub policy name`. If you opted to create a new Event Hub and a namespace during the [ARM template deployment](#eventhub-arm-setup), select the following automatically created settings (the namespace name will have a different suffix):

<img
  alt="Destination details settings"
  src={serverlessAzureEventHubDestinationDetailsSettings}
/>

8. Click **Save** to start forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic:

## Send logs from Azure Blob storage [#azure-blob-storage]

[Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) allows you to store massive amounts of unstructured data, including log files. Using the [New Relic Blob Storage ARM template](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions/blob/master/armTemplates/azuredeploy-blobforwarder.json), you will be able to create a function that forwards the contents of a [container placed in a Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#blob-storage-resources).

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic Blob Storage ARM template deploys a function that forwards all the blob files within the specified container **at their current state**. If any of these blobs is modified thereafter, the **complete** contents of the file will be resent.

  This solution aims to forward static blob files to New Relic, and it does not support file tailing. If you need to forward a stream of logs, we recommend to send your application logs to an `Event Hub` and use the [Event Hub based template](#azure-eventhub) instead.
</Callout>

To send the blobs from a container in your Storage Account, follow these steps:

1. [Deploy](#blobstorage-arm-setup) the New Relic Blob Storage ARM template.
2. [Explore your log data](#find-data).

### Deploy the New Relic Blob Storage ARM template [#blobstorage-arm-setup]

Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
2. Go to our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) and click **Add more data sources** on the top right of the page.
3. Under **Log ingestion**, click the `Microsoft Azure Blob Storage` tile.
4. Select the account you want to send the logs, and click **Continue**.
5. Click **Generate API key** and copy the generated **API key**.
6. Click **Deploy to Azure** and a new tab will be open with the ARM template loaded in Azure.
7. Select the **Resource group** where you want to create the necessary resources, and a **Region**. Despite not being mandatory, we recommend installing the template in a new resource group, to avoid deleting any of the components it creates accidentally.
8. In the **New Relic license key** field, paste the previously copied **API key**.
9. Introduce the names for the storage account and the container that you wish to forward.
10. Ensure the [New Relic endpoint](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint) is set to the one corresponding to your account.
11. Click **Review + create**, review the data you've inserted, and click **Create**.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If you want to only query for logs coming from Azure, run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log where plugin.type='azure'
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## Security recommendations for your Azure resources [#azure-security-recommendations]

In May 2023, we included some security enhancements in our ARM templates that modify the settings in the storage account and the Function App deployed using those templates. Azure resources are secured by default and these changed settings prevent this secure default state from being modified.

If you deployed our ARM templates prior to May 2023, modify your existing setup by:
- [Disabling public network access to the Storage account](#disabling-public-network-access-storage-account)
- [Disabling public access to the blobs/containers in the Storage account](#disabling-public-access-to-blobs)
- [Disabling FTP access to the Function App](#disabling-ftp-access-to-function-app)
- [Enforcing HTTPS to the Function App](#enforcing-https-function-app)
- [Disabling public network access to the Function App](#disabling-public-network-access-function-app)

If you have any questions regarding this notice, contact [our support team](https://support.newrelic.com).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="disabling-public-network-access-storage-account"
    title="Disabling public network access to your storage account"
  >
    Modifying this setting is quite complex, as it involves: 
    - Creating another private-access storage account. 
    - Moving all the file shares and blobs to this new private-access storage account.
    - Creating private endpoints for the new private-access storage account. 
    - Creating DNS records for the new private endpoints. 
    - Modifying the network configuration of the Function App accordingly. 

    Due to this complexity, we recommend you to redeploy our ARM template from scratch instead of attempting to manually modify this setting.

    <Callout variant="tip">
    If you can't complete a full redeployment, read how to perform a redeployment of an existing storage account in [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/configure-networking-how-to?tabs=portal#existing-function-app), or in this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/secure-storage-account-linked-to-function-app-with-private/ba-p/2644772). When following the instructions, avoid adding the `WEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALL` option.
