You can send your [Amazon Security Lake logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/internal-sources.html) to New Relic using Serverless app 
`newrelic-securitylake-s3-processor-LogForwarder`, which can be easily deployed from [AWS Serverless application repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications).

Forwarding logs from your Security Lake to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.
