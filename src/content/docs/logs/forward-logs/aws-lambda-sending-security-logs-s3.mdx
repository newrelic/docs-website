You can send your [Amazon Security Lake logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/internal-sources.html) to New Relic using Serverless app 
`newrelic-securitylake-s3-processor-LogForwarder`, which can be easily deployed from [AWS Serverless application repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications).

Forwarding logs from your Security Lake to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Install the Serverless application [#install-app]

To install the Serverless app to forward your Security Lake logs to New Relic:

1. Make sure you have a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
2. Open the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications) in your browser.

3. Search for `newrelic` and check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** to find `newrelic-securitylake-s3-processor-LogForwarder`.
4. Click the `newrelic-securitylake-s3-processor-LogForwarder` details and click **Deploy**.
5. Follow the app guidance to set up necessary parameters:
* `SecurityLakeSQSArn`
* `SecurityLakeSubscriberRoleArn`
* `ExternalID`
* `NRLicenseKey`

You'll get `SecurityLakeSQSArn` and `SecurityLakeSubscriberRoleArn` from your Security lake provider.

Keep in mind that event source region must match Lambda region.
