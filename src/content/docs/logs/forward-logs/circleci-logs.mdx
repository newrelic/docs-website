Configure the [CircleCI webhook](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/webhooks/) service to send CI/CD Logs to New Relic.

## Set up a webhook trigger in CircleCI [#setup]

Complete these steps to set up a CircleCI webhook to forward your logs to New Relic:

1. Log in to [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/projects).
2. Go to one of your CircleCI projects.
3. Click **Project settings**.
4. In the sidebar of your Project Settings, click **Webhooks**.
5. Click **Add webhook**.
6. Name your webhook.
7. Enter New Relic's **Logs endpoint**:
    * US: 
    
        ```
        "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
        ```

    * EU: 
    
        ```
        "https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
        ```

    Use the region you set on your New Relic account. Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.

8. Select either **Workflow** or **Job**, depending on the type of event you want to trigger the logpush.
9. If you've set up your receiving API or third-party service, click **Test ping event** to create a test event.
