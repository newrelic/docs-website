If your log data is already being monitored by [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), you can use our [Fluent Bit output plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic. This plugin is also provided in a standalone Docker image that can be installed in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster in the form of a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). We refer to this as our Kubernetes plugin.

Forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Enable Kubernetes for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your logs to New Relic with our Kubernetes plugin for Fluent Bit:

1. Make sure you have:

* An <LicenseKey/>
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) cluster deployed

2. Follow the procedures in GitHub to [install the Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#installation).
3. Optional: If you are installing the plugin as a Helm chart, you can set [numerous configurations](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.
4. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic's Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Kubernetes documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#installation). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
