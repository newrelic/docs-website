New Relic's Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding simplifies sending logs from your cluster to New Relic logs. It uses a standalone Docker image and runs as a DaemonSet, seamlessly collecting logs for centralized analysis and troubleshooting. Forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic will give you enhanced l<InlinePopover type="logs" /> capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Enable Kubernetes for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your Kubernetes logs to New Relic with our plugin:

1. Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration following the steps from [this page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/). This integration includes the Kubernetes plugin for logs.
2. Optionally, you can further tune your installation in [Step 4 from the guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#kubernetes-install-navigation) using the numerous configuration options available in the [newrelic-logging repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.

  <Callout variant="important">

  If you're [using a Kubernetes secret](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging/values.yaml#L8-L25) to store the New Relic license key, the `newrelic-logging` chart defaults to sending logs to the US API endpoint. If the license key belongs to an EU or FedRAMP account, and a secret is used for key storage, you must update the endpoint setting with the appropriate value from the [API reference docs](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint). Here's an example of how to set this for EU accounts:

  ```yml
  newrelic-logging:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1
  ```
  </Callout>

3. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## Install Fluent Bit output plugin [#fluent-bit]

New Relic has a [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) [output plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to forward your logs to New Relic log management. This plugin is also provided in a standalone Docker image that can be installed in a Kubernetes cluster in the form of a DaemonSet, also known as the Kubernetes plugin.

You can install it in your cluster using our Helm chart in two ways.

### Use our guided install [#helm-guided-install]
Although the [newrelic-logging](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging) chart works as a standalone, we recommend installing it as part of the [nri-bundle](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart. 

The best way to install this is through our [guided installation](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/) process. This guided install can generate the Helm 3 commands required to install it ([see "Helm 3"](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#finish-your-install)). 

### Manual installation [#manual-helm-install]

Alternately, you can install it manually using Helm, by running this command to install the repo:

```bash
    helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
```
To update the repo you can run:

```bash
    helm repo update newrelic
```

Go here for [uninstallation instructions](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes/).

## Troubleshoot your Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding installation [#troubleshoot-installation]

Sometimes, despite correctly installing the Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding (`newrelic-logging` [Helm chart](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging)), you may encounter performance issues that affect the correct delivery of logs. In such circumstances, looking at the log forwarder internal metrics can be helpful to understand the cause of a potential bottleneck.

The `newrelic-logging` Helm chart provides a configuration setting to enable the collection of such metrics for a given Kubernetes cluster. We also provide a JSON-formatted dashboard template to easily display all these metrics in New Relic.

To configure your Kubernetes cluster to send the log forwarder internal metrics and represent them in a dashboard, follow these steps:

  1. Install the Helm chart with the following extra configuration setting:
    ```yml
    newrelic-logging:
      fluentBit:
        sendMetrics: true
    ```
  You only need to enable the `newrelic-logging.fluentBit.sendMetrics` setting when troubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend enabling it for a single Kubernetes cluster at a time to ease troubleshooting.
  2. Download [this dashboard template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/helm-charts/master/charts/newrelic-logging/fluent-bit-and-plugin-metrics-dashboard-template.json). Open it in a text editor and replace all the `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` occurrences (49 in total) by your [New Relic Account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/).
  3. Import the resulting dashboard in JSON format by following [these instructions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#import-json).
  4. The imported dashboard will be available in your [Dashboards page](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards) as `Kubernetes Fluent Bit monitoring`.

### Additional metric details
The `newrelic-logging` Helm chart uses [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) together with New Relic's [newrelic-fluent-bit-output plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to send logs to New Relic. The `fluentBit.sendMetrics` configuration option enables the collection of their individual metrics:

  * **[Fluent Bit internal metrics](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#for-v2-metrics)**: emitted by Fluent Bit in Prometheus format and delivered to New Relic's Prometheus Export endpoint. They can be faceted by `cluster_name`, `node_name` and `pod_name`.
  * **[newrelic-fluent-bit-output's internal plugin metrics](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting-metrics)**: collected by the output plugin and sent to New Relic's Metric API. These metrics only contain the `cluster_name` dimension, so they can be narrowed down to a particular cluster but not to a particular host or pod. They are useful to assess the overall latency when delivering the logs to the New Relic Logs API or to observe potential packaging problems.

We capture Fluent Bit's internal metrics by using its [prometheus_scrape INPUT plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/prometheus-scrape-metrics) in conjunction with its [prometheus_remote_write OUTPUT plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/prometheus-remote-write). All the Prometheus `counter` metrics are actually _cumulative counters_, but we automatically perform a _delta conversion_ when they are ingested at New Relic to ease querying them using NRQL later. You can find more details [here](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/cumulative-metrics/).

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, you can uninstall the Kubernetes plugin by following the steps outlined [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
