New Relic's Kubernetes plugin for log forwarding simplifies sending logs from your cluster to New Relic logs. It uses a standalone Docker image and runs as a DaemonSet, seamlessly collecting logs for centralized analysis and troubleshooting. Forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic will give you enhanced l<InlinePopover type="logs" /> capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Enable Kubernetes for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your Kubernetes logs to New Relic with our plugin:

1. Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration following the steps from [this page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/). This integration includes the Kubernetes plugin for logs.
2. Optionally, you can further tune your installation in [Step 4 from the guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#kubernetes-install-navigation) using the numerous configuration options available in the [newrelic-logging repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.

  <Callout variant="important">
  
  If you're [using a Kubernetes secret](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging/values.yaml#L8-L25) to store the New Relic license key, the `newrelic-logging` chart defaults to sending logs to the US API endpoint. If the license key belongs to an EU or FedRAMP account, and a secret is used for key storage, you must update the endpoint setting with the appropriate value from the [API reference docs](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint). Here's an example of how to set this for EU accounts:

  ```
  newrelic-logging:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1
  ```
  </Callout>

3. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, you can uninstall the Kubernetes plugin by following the steps outlined [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
