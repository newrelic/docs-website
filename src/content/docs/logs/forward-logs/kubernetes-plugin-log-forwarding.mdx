New Relic offers an output [plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) for [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)to easily forward your logs to [New Relic Logs](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs). This plugin is also provided in a standalone Docker image that can be installed in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster in the form of a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). We refer to this as our **Kubernetes plugin** for log forwarding.

Forwarding your Kubernetes logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Enable Kubernetes for log management [#enable-process]

To forward your Kubernetes logs to New Relic with our plugin:

1. Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration following the steps from [this page](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/). This integration includes the Kubernetes plugin for logs.
2. Optionally, you can further tune your installation in [Step 3 from the guided install](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#kubernetes-install-navigation) using the numerous configuration options available in the [newrelic-logging repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.
3. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with our [logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, you can uninstall the Kubernetes plugin by following the steps outlined [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/uninstall-kubernetes/). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
