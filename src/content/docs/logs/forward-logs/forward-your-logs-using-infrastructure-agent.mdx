Forwarding your logs to New Relic makes all of your logging data available in one location, providing deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. With your logs in one spot, you can collect, process, explore, query, and alert on errors or anomalies found in your log data.

<figcaption>
From your host's UI, your logs are placed in context of events for the selected time period. You can drill down into detailed data for any of the highlighted attributes.
</figcaption>

How you forward your logs depends on how you installed the infrastructure agent, since the infrastructure agent enables the log forwarding feature. You can install the infrastructure agent via:

* Guided install (recommended for most users)
* Manual installation
* Linux tarball

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="system"
    title="Review system requirements"
  >

* Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher
* [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/). The infrastructure agent already installs the latest version for you. To update or downgrade it to a specfic version, refer to the [Fluent Bit installation](#install-fb-version) procedures.
* OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher
* Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (for example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in infrastructure agent [1.20.6](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/releases/tag/1.20.6).
* Amazon Linux 2
* CentOS version 7 or higher
* Debian version 9 ("Stretch") or higher. Version 11 is not supported.
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) version 12
* Ubuntu versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions)
* Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, and 2022, and their service packs
* Windows 10

## Enable log forwarding on agent installed manually [#manual]

To install the infrastructure agent manually, follow our [tutorial to install the package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-agent-linux-using-package-manager), or check out our [MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer) (Windows). 

### Step 1. Configure the infrastructure agent 

Configuration files direct your system to forward the log sources you want to appear in New Relic. You can add as many config files as you want. Our infrastructure agent uses `.yml` files to configure logging. If you install the infrastructure agent via [Add data](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=78678a7f-91c5-ca40-ac55-e6b74a50085c) in the UI, the file `logging.yml` is created automatically.

To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature:

1. Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder:

   * Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d\`

2. Create a `logging.yml` configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The `logging.d` directory has various `.yml.example` files you can use as a reference or starting point.

The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration.

### Step 2. Set log forwarding parameters [#parameters]

You're required to set up a `name` and log source parameter in the log forwarding `.yml` config file. To start, define a `name` of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. 

What you use for the log source depends on the location your logs are sourced from. Available options for the log source include:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="file"
    title="file"
  >
    Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to `tail -f` shell.

    **Example:**

    ```
    logs:
      - name: example-log
        file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file
      - name: example-log-two
        file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file
    ```

    The `file` parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, `/logs/*.log`. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories.

    **Example:**

    ```
    logs:
      - name: docker-logs
        file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to [Errors when tailing a large amount of log files](#too-many-files) for more details on how to increase them.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="systemd"
    title="systemd"
  >
    Use the `systemd` parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the `journald` daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in [root mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes).

    **Example:**

    ```
    logs:
      - name: systemd-example
        systemd: cupsd
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="syslog"
    title="syslog"
  >
    Syslog data source.

    **Parameters:**

    * `uri:` Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol:
      * TCP/UDP network sockets: `[tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`
      * Unix domain sockets: `unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path`
    * `parser:` Syslog parser. Default is `rfc3164`. Use `rfc5424` if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: `rfc3164` currently does not work on SuSE.
    * `unix_permissions:` default is `0644` for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use `0666` to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk.

      When running the agent in [privileged mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), ports and sockets must be available or owned by `nri-agent`, with `0666` file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets.

      ```
      logs:
        # TCP network socket
        - name: syslog-tcp-test
          syslog:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164
        # UDP network socket
        - name: syslog-udp-test
          syslog:
            uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
          max_line_kb: 35
        # Unix TCP domain socket
        - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test
          syslog:
            uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test
            unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk
        # Unix UDP domain socket
        - name: syslog-unix-udp-test
          syslog:
            uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test
            parser: rfc5424
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tcp"
    title="tcp"
  >
    Logs retrieved over TCP connections.

    **Parameters:**

    * `uri:` TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is `tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`
    * `format:` format of the data. It can be `json` or `none`.
    * `separator:` If `format: none` is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: `\n`).

      ```
      logs:
        - name: tcp-simple-test
          tcp:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp'
            separator: \t # String for separating raw text entries
          max_line_kb: 32
        - name: tcp-json-test
          tcp:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            format: json

    </Callout>

    Collect event from Windows log channels using new Windows Event Log API using the [winevtlog Fluent Bit plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/windows-event-log-winevtlog).

    **Parameters:**

    * `channel:` name of the channel logs will be collected from.
    * `collect-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported.
    * `exclude-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported.

      All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the `collect-eventids` and `exclude-eventids` sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account.

      Add event IDs or ranges to `collect-eventids` or `exclude-eventids` to forward or drop specific events. `exclude-eventids` takes precedence over `collect-eventids` if the same event ID is present in both sections.

      **Example:**

      ```
      logs:

    </Callout>
    Collect events from Windows log channels.

    **Parameters:**

    * `channel:` name of the channel logs will be collected from. It doesn't work for custom channels.
    * `collect-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported.
    * `exclude-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported.

      All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the `collect-eventids` and `exclude-eventids` sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account.

      Add event IDs or ranges to `collect-eventids` or `exclude-eventids` to forward or drop specific events. `exclude-eventids` takes precedence over `collect-eventids` if the same event ID is present in both sections.

      **Example:**

### Step 3. Define key attributes [#optional-config]

Although these configuration parameters aren't required, we still recommend you apply these configurations to your `logging.yml` file so you get the most out of log forwarding.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="attributes"
    title="attributes"
  >
    List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The `attributes` configuration parameter can be used with any log source.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The `attributes` configuration parameter does not add custom attributes to logs forwarded via external Fluent Bit configuration (for example, using the `fluentbit` configuration parameter). In this scenario, you should refer to the `record_modifier` option in the [Fluent Bit documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/).
    </Callout>

    One common use of the `attributes` configuration parameter is to specify the `logtype` attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the [built-in parsing rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/parsing/#built-in-rules) supported by New Relic's log management capabilities.

    **Example:**

    ```
    logs:
     - name: example-file-attributes
       file: /var/log/example.log
       attributes:
         logtype: nginx
         region: example-us-02
         team: A-team
     - name: example-tcp-attributes
       tcp:
         uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345
         format: json
       attributes:
         logtype: nginx
         region: example-us-02
         team: B-team
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="automatically-inserted-attributess"
    title="attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent"
  >
    The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute name
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `entity.guids`
          </td>

          <td>
            Always inserted.

            The infrastructure agent inserts the [Entity GUID](/attribute-dictionary/span/entityguid) assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the `entity.guids` field.

            Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the `entity.guids` field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `fb.input`
          </td>

          <td>
            Always inserted.

            The underlying [Fluent Bit input plugin type](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs) used to capture the logs. Currently its values are `tail`, `systemd`, `winlog`, `syslog`, and `tcp`.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `filePath`
          </td>

          <td>
            Inserted when using the `file` input type.

            Absolute file path of the file being monitored.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `hostname`
          </td>

          <td>
            Always inserted.

            The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `plugin.type`
          </td>

          <td>
            Always inserted.

            Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value `nri-agent`.
          </td>

  <Collapser
    id="pattern"
    title="pattern"
  >
    Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the `tail`, `systemd`, `syslog`, and `tcp` (only with format `none`) sources.

    This field works in a way similar to `grep -E` in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either `WARN` or `ERROR` using:

    ```
    - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error
      file: /var/log/logFile.log
      pattern: WARN|ERROR
    ```

    No filtering is applied by default.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="max_line_kb"
    title="max_line_kb"
  >
    Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is `128`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="fluentbit"
    title="fluentbit"
  >
    External [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent.

    The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the `logging.d` directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate `[INPUT]`, `[FILTER]` and `[OUTPUT]` sections. Optionally, it will also declare an `@INCLUDE` in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the `fluentbit` option.

    The runtime file does not define a [`[SERVICE]` section](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/classic-mode/configuration-file), leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own `[SERVICE]` section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the `fluentbit` option.

    **Parameters:**

    `config_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic's Logs UI.

    `parsers_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: `rfc3164`, `rfc3164-local` and `rfc5424`.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The infrastructure agent allows forwarding logs for the most common use cases by defining simple log forwarding configurations in the YAML files in the `logging.d/` directory, as described in this document. These files are internally translated into Fluent Bit configuration files with the correct format and sane configuration defaults. New Relic provides official support for these configuration options, since we ensure that the generated configuration files are correct and operative.

      Nevertheless, for those use cases not covered by our supported configuration options, we provide the possibility to use an externally-generated Fluent Bit configuration and parsers file using the `fluentbit`, `config_file` and `parsers_file` options.

      Note that we cannot guarantee the correct operation of the log forwarded in this case, given that the provided configurations are completely arbitrary, and are not being generated/validated by the agent. Therefore, New Relic does not provide official support for the external configurations specified via these options.

### Step 4. View your log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see logs and related telemetry data in these places:

* The selected host's **Summary** page in the New Relic UI: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Explorer** or **Infrastructure > Hosts > (select an entity) > Logs**.
* [New Relic's Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

## Enable logging for your on-host integrations [#on-host]

With the infrastructure agent installed, you can enable automatic log parsing and forwarding for our most popular on-host integrations with one step. To enable this feature, rename the `on-host-log.yml.example` file to `on-host-log.yml`. Once done, your integration's logs are automatically parsed and sent to New Relic.

This option is available for our [supported Linux platforms](#requirements).

## Enable log forwarding on agent installed using Linux tarball [#tarball-install]

Our custom Linux installation process for infrastructure monitoring allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation process, and to place files and folders on your machine. If you choose the [assisted](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-assisted-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) or [manual](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) tarball installation process, follow these steps to implement the log forwarder feature:

1. Create the following directories:

- `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging`
- `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d`

2. Download and install New Relic's [fluent-bit-package (RPM)](https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/releases) by running a command similar to:
  ```shell
   yum localinstall td-agent-bit-<some-version>.rpm`
   ```

3. Download New Relic's [fluentbit plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases) and save it as `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging/out_newrelic.so`.

4. Download or copy the `parsers.conf` file from [this Github repository](https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/blob/main/parsers.conf), and save it as `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging/parsers.conf`.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="no-data"

    The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running `nri-agent`.

    **Example: Check file access under Linux**

    Let's check whether the file `/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log` can be monitored by the `nri-agent` user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the `namei` command:

    ```
    sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs
    logFile.log - No such file or directory
    ```

    This command failed because the file is not visible to the `nri-agent` user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the `restrictedLogs` directory is missing the execution flag for `others`.

    To fix this, execute:

    ```
    sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs
    ```

    And then check for file access again:

    ```
    # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs
    -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log
    ```

    The file is now visible to the `nri-agent` user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the `nri-agent` user. To check this, use:

    ```
    # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied
    ```

    In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the `others` group (users other than `vagrant` and the `vagrant` user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to `others`, but the application could change these permissions upon restart.

    To avoid this, a better approach is to add the `nri-agent` user to the `vagrant` user group.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="syslog"
    title="No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket"
  >
    The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes):

    * If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the `nri-agent` user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (`666`) so that other users than `nri-agent` can write to them.
    * If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port `80`, for example).

      If no data appears after you enable log management, follow [standard log management troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="proxy"
    title="No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy"
  >
    As explained in the [infrastructure agent configuration guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#proxy), the `proxy` parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs:

    ```
    [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \"hostname:port\":
    first path segment in URL cannot contain colon
    ```

    To solve this problem, check your `newrelic-infra.yml` file, and ensure the `proxy` parameter adheres to this form.

    If you're using `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir` in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS:

    **Linux**
    For `HTTP` proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir` parameters.

    **Windows**

    * For `HTTP` proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates.

    * For `HTTPS`, you can configure it in one of the following ways:

    * Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended)
      Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to [this link](https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/how-to-import-intermediate-and-root-certificates-via-mmc/), and in **Step 2** ensure to import it in your `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`, instead of in the `Intermediate Certification Authorities`.

    * Using the `caBundleFile` and `caBundleDir` parameters
      On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the `caBundleFile` `caBundleDir` parameters. So, if you are using `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir`, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using `caBundleFile`) or in the same directory (when using `caBundleDir`):

    * The proxy certificate (because it's an `HTTPS` proxy).

    * The logging endpoint certificate (eg. `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`).

    * The infrastructure agent certificate (eg. `https://infra-api.newrelic.com`).

      You can check the certificates by running:

      ```
      # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com
      ```

<Callout variant="important">
  Trace logging generates a lot of data very quickly. To reduce disk space consumption and data ingest, when finished generating logs, be sure to set `level: info` (or lower).

    To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic:

    1. Edit your `newrelic-infra.yml` file.
    2. Enable logs forwarding to New Relic by adding the following config snippet
       ```
       log:
         level: trace # Recommended: Helps with troubleshooting
         forward: true # Enables sending logs to New Relic
         format: json # Recommended: Enable agent logging in JSON format
         stdout: false # On Windows and systems that don't use `systemd` or where `journald` is inaccessible

    3. [Restart the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) to load the new settings.

 This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)) will continue in a non-verbose mode.

    id="too-many-files"
    title="Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux)"
  >
It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files:

* `Too many open files`
* `The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource`

The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above.

The underlying technology we use to forward logs, [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, **to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail**.

The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in `root` [running mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes/), and therefore must be run using the `root` user.

1. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified.

   ```
   ulimit -Hn
   ```

2. Add the following line to `/etc/security/limits.conf`. We specified a limit of `10100` here instead of just `10000` to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work.

   ```
   root    soft    nofile  10100  # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations
   ```

3. Add the following line to `/etc/pam.d/common-session` so that the previous limit is applied upon restart:

   ```
   session required pam_limits.so
   ```

4. Add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf` to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of `18192` here instead of just `10000` so that the `root` user will still have `8192` available inotify watches (the default value).

   ```
   fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192
   ```

5. Restart your system.

6. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running:

   ```
   ulimit -Sn                                    # Should return 10100
   cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches     # Should return 18192
   ```

    title="Install a particular Fluent Bit version (Linux)"
  >
    Prior to version [1.19.0](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1190) (or version [1.20.3](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1203) for SLES 12.5), the Linux infrastructure agent came bundled with a Fluent Bit binary. Starting in this version, Fluent Bit is now included as as a separate `recommended` package dependency.

    This means that you can install, update, or downgrade Fluent Bit separately from the agent. For your convenience, we have included several Fluent Bit packages in the same repository where the infrastructure lives, so you don't need to install any additional repositories to upgrade Fluent Bit.

    Note that the agent automatically installs Fluent Bit when you first install it, using the latest available version. After the first installation, you can upgrade Fluent Bit as you would normally do with any Linux package.

    You can list the available Fluent Bit versions by running:

    RPM:

    ```
    sudo yum check-update
    yum list td-agent-bit --showduplicates
    ```

    DEB:

    ```
    sudo apt update
    apt-cache showpkg td-agent-bit
    ```

    To upgrade to a particular Fluent Bit version, just run (in the following examples, version `1.8.12` is used):

    RPM:

    ```
    # Remove command only required when downgrading to a previous version
    sudo yum remove td-agent-bit
    sudo yum install td-agent-bit-1.8.12-1
    ```

## Disable log forwarding [#uninstall]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, go to your `logging.d` directory, and remove files with the `.yml` extension that were originally added during the [configuration](#configure) process.

* Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`
* Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d\`
