Forwarding your logs to New Relic makes all of your logging data available in one location, providing deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. With your logs in one spot, you can collect, process, explore, query, and alert on errors or anomalies found in your log data.

<figcaption>
From your host's UI, your logs are placed in context of events for the selected time period. You can drill down into detailed data for any of the highlighted attributes.
</figcaption>

How you forward your logs depends on how you installed the infrastructure agent, since the infrastructure agent enables the log forwarding feature. You can install the infrastructure agent via:

* Guided install (recommended for most users)
* Manual installation
* Linux tarball

<Callout variant="important">
  The Linux version of infrastructure agent, specifically version 1.42.0, has transitioned from using the td-agent-bit package to the fluent-bit package. This change was necessitated by the fact that fluent-bit is no longer distributed in the td-agent-bit flavour after the major version 2.x update.

  To ensure smooth operations and provide the option to revert to td-agent-bit in the event of any issues with the fluent-bit package, the infrastructure agent now installs both packages (td-agent-bit and fluent-bit). By default, the agent is configured to use fluent-bit.

  See [Rollback to Fluent Bit 1.9](#rollback-after-fluent-bit-2) for more information about how to rollback.

## Enable log forwarding on agent installed manually [#manual]

To install the infrastructure agent manually, follow our [tutorial to install the package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-agent-linux-using-package-manager), or check out our [MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer) (Windows).

### Step 1. Configure the infrastructure agent

Configuration files direct your system to forward the log sources you want to appear in New Relic. You can add as many config files as you want. Our infrastructure agent uses `.yml` files to configure logging. If you install the infrastructure agent via [Add data](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=78678a7f-91c5-ca40-ac55-e6b74a50085c) in the UI, the file `logging.yml` is created automatically.

To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature:

1. Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder:

   * Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d\`

2. Create a `logging.yml` configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The `logging.d` directory has various `.yml.example` files you can use as a reference or starting point. For Windows examples, see [our Github repo](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/tree/master/assets/examples/logging/windows).

  ```yml
  # Log forwarder configuration file example
  # Source: file
  # Available customization parameters: attributes, max_line_kb, pattern
  logs:
    # Basic tailing of a single file
    - name: basic-file
      file: /var/log/logFile.log

    # File with spaces in its path. No need to use quotes.
    - name: file-with-spaces-in-path
      file: /var/log/folder with spaces/logFile.log

    # Specify a list of custom attributes, as key-value pairs, to be included
    # in each log record
    - name: file-with-attributes
      file: /var/log/logFile.log
      attributes:
        application: tomcat
        department: sales
        maintainer: example@mailprovider.com

    # Use wildcards to refer to multiple files having a common extension or
    # prefix. Newly generated files will be automatically detected every 60
    # seconds.
    #
    # WARNING: avoid using wildcards that include the file extension, since
    # it'll cause logs to be forwarded repeatedly if log rotation is enabled.
    - name: log-files-in-folder
      file: /var/log/logF*.log

    # Lines longer than 128 KB will be automatically skipped. Use 'max_line_kb'
    # to increase this limit.
    - name: log-file-with-long-lines
      file: /var/log/logFile.log
      max_line_kb: 256

    # Use 'pattern' to filter records using a regular expression
    - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error
      file: /var/log/logFile.log
      pattern: WARN|ERROR
  ```

The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration.

### Step 2. Set log forwarding parameters [#parameters]

You're required to set up a `name` and log source parameter in the log forwarding `.yml` config file. To start, define a `name` of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic.

What you use for the log source depends on the location your logs are sourced from. Available options for the log source include:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="file"
    title="file"
  >
    Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to `tail -f` shell.

    **Example:**

    ```yml
      logs:
      - name: example-log
        file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file
      - name: example-log-two
        file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file
    ```

    The `file` parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, `/logs/*.log`. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories.

    **Example:**

    ```yml
    logs:
      - name: docker-logs
        file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to [Errors when tailing a large amount of log files](#too-many-files) for more details on how to increase them.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="systemd"
    title="systemd"
  >
    Use the `systemd` parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the `journald` daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in [root mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes).

    **Example:**

    ```yml
    logs:
      - name: systemd-example
        systemd: cupsd
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="syslog"
    title="syslog"
  >
    Syslog data source.

    **Parameters:**

    * `uri:` Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol:
      * TCP/UDP network sockets: `[tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`
      * Unix domain sockets: `unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path`
    * `parser:` Syslog parser. Default is `rfc3164`. Use `rfc5424` if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: `rfc3164` currently does not work on SuSE.
    * `unix_permissions:` Default is `0644` for domain sockets. This limits entries to processes running as root. You can use `0666` to listen for non-root processes (at your own risk).

      When running the agent in [privileged mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), ports and sockets must be available or owned by `nri-agent` and with `0666` file permissions so that other processes can write logs to the sockets.

      ```yml
      logs:
        # TCP network socket
        - name: syslog-tcp-test
          syslog:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164
        # UDP network socket
        - name: syslog-udp-test
          syslog:
            uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
          max_line_kb: 35
        # Unix TCP domain socket
        - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test
          syslog:
            uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test
            unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk
        # Unix UDP domain socket
        - name: syslog-unix-udp-test
          syslog:
            uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test
            parser: rfc5424
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tcp"
    title="tcp"
  >
    Logs retrieved over TCP connections.

    **Parameters:**

    * `uri:` TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is `tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`.
    * `format:` Format of the data. It can be `json` or `none`.
    * `separator:` If `format: none` is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: `\n`).

      ```yml
      logs:
        - name: tcp-simple-test
          tcp:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp'
            separator: \t # String for separating raw text entries
          max_line_kb: 32
        - name: tcp-json-test
          tcp:
            uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
            format: json
      ```

    </Callout>

    Collect event from Windows log channels using new Windows Event Log API using the [winevtlog Fluent Bit plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/windows-event-log-winevtlog).

    **Parameters:**

    * `channel`: Name of the channel logs will be collected from.
    * `collect-eventids`: List of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported.
    * `exclude-eventids`: List of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported.
    * `use-ansi`: Use ANSI encoding on winevtlog messages. We use ANSI encoding by default on Windows Server 2016 and older versions, and UTF-8 on newer ones. You can override this behavior with this configuration parameter if these defaults do not suit your use case.

      All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the `collect-eventids` and `exclude-eventids` sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account.

      Add event IDs or ranges to `collect-eventids` or `exclude-eventids` to forward or drop specific events. `exclude-eventids` takes precedence over `collect-eventids` if the same event ID is present in both sections.

### Step 3. Define key attributes [#optional-config]

Although these configuration parameters aren't required, we still recommend you apply these configurations to your `logging.yml` file so you get the most out of log forwarding.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="attributes"
    title="attributes"
  >
    List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The `attributes` configuration parameter can be used with any log source.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The `attributes` configuration parameter does not add custom attributes to logs forwarded via external Fluent Bit configuration (for example, using the `fluentbit` configuration parameter). In this scenario, you should refer to the `record_modifier` option in the [Fluent Bit documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/).
    </Callout>

    One common use of the `attributes` configuration parameter is to specify the `logtype` attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the [built-in parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/parsing/#built-in-rules) supported by New Relic's <InlinePopover type="logs" /> capabilities.

    **Example:**

    ```yml
    logs:
      - name: example-file-attributes
        file: /var/log/example.log
        attributes:
          logtype: nginx
          region: example-us-02
          team: A-team
      - name: example-tcp-attributes
        tcp:
          uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345
          format: json
        attributes:
          logtype: nginx
          region: example-us-02
          team: B-team
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="automatically-inserted-attributess"
    title="attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent"
  >
    The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder.

    Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the `tail`, `systemd`, `syslog`, and `tcp` (only with format `none`) sources.

    This field works in a way similar to `grep -E` in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either `WARN` or `ERROR` using:

    ```yml
    - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error

    External [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent.

    The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the `logging.d` directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate `[INPUT]`, `[FILTER]` and `[OUTPUT]` sections. Optionally, it will also declare an `@INCLUDE` in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the `fluentbit` option.

    The runtime file does not define a [`[SERVICE]` section](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/classic-mode/configuration-file), leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own `[SERVICE]` section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the `fluentbit` option.

    **Parameters:**

    `config_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in our logs UI.

    `parsers_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: `rfc3164`, `rfc3164-local` and `rfc5424`.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The infrastructure agent allows forwarding logs for the most common use cases by defining simple log forwarding configurations in the YAML files in the `logging.d/` directory, as described in this document. These files are internally translated into Fluent Bit configuration files with the correct format and sane configuration defaults. New Relic provides official support for these configuration options since we ensure that the generated configuration files are correct and operative.

      Nevertheless, for those use cases not covered by our supported configuration options, we provide the possibility to use an externally-generated Fluent Bit configuration and parsers file using the `fluentbit`, `config_file`, and `parsers_file` options.

      Note: We cannot guarantee the correct operation of the log forwarded in this case, given that the provided configurations are completely arbitrary and are not being generated/validated by the agent. Therefore, New Relic does not provide official support for the external configurations specified via these options.

### Step 4. View your log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see logs and related telemetry data in these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* In the infrastructure UI, from the host table, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for a specific host, and then click **View logs**.
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

## Enable logging for your on-host integrations [#on-host]

With the infrastructure agent installed, you can enable automatic log parsing and forwarding for our most popular on-host integrations with one step. To enable this feature, rename the `on-host-log.yml.example` file to `on-host-log.yml`. Once done, your integration's logs are automatically parsed and sent to New Relic.

This option is available for our [supported Linux platforms](#requirements).

## Enable log forwarding on agent installed using Linux tarball [#tarball-install]

Our custom Linux installation process for infrastructure monitoring allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation process, and to place files and folders on your machine. If you choose the [assisted](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-assisted-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) or [manual](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) tarball installation process, follow these steps to implement the log forwarder feature:

1. Create the following directories:

- `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging`
- `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d`

2. Download and install New Relic's [fluent-bit-package (RPM)](https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/releases) by running a command similar to:

    ```shell
    yum localinstall fluent-bit-<some-version>.rpm`
    ```

3. Download New Relic's [fluentbit plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases) and save it as `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging/out_newrelic.so`.

4. Download or copy the `parsers.conf` file from [this Github repository](https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/blob/main/parsers.conf), and save it as `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging/parsers.conf`.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="no-data"

    The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running `nri-agent`.

    **Example: Check file access under Linux**

    Let's check whether the file `/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log` can be monitored by the `nri-agent` user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the `namei` command:

    ```bash
    sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs
    logFile.log - No such file or directory
    ```

    This command failed because the file is not visible to the `nri-agent` user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the `restrictedLogs` directory is missing the execution flag for `others`.

    To fix this, execute:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs
    ```

    And then check for file access again:

    ```bash
    # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs
    -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log
    ```

    The file is now visible to the `nri-agent` user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the `nri-agent` user. To check this, use:

    ```bash
    # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied
    ```

    In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the `others` group (users other than `vagrant` and the `vagrant` user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to `others`, but the application could change these permissions upon restart.

    To avoid this, a better approach is to add the `nri-agent` user to the `vagrant` user group.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="syslog"
    title="No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket"
  >
    The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes):

    * If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the `nri-agent` user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (`666`) so that other users than `nri-agent` can write to them.
    * If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port `80`, for example).

      If no data appears after you enable log management, follow [standard log management troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="proxy"
    title="No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy"
  >
    As explained in the [infrastructure agent configuration guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#proxy), the `proxy` parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form `https://user:password@hostname:port`. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs:

    ```
    [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \"hostname:port\":
    first path segment in URL cannot contain colon
    ```

    To solve this problem, check your `newrelic-infra.yml` file, and ensure the `proxy` parameter adheres to this form.

    If you're using `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir` in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS:

    **Linux**
    For `HTTP` proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir` parameters.

    **Windows**

    * For `HTTP` proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates.

    * For `HTTPS`, you can configure it in one of the following ways:

        * (Recommended) Import the proxy certificate to the system pool. Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to [this link](https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/how-to-import-intermediate-and-root-certificates-via-mmc/), and in **Step 2** ensure to import it in your `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` instead of in the `Intermediate Certification Authorities`.

        * Use the `caBundleFile` and `caBundleDir` parameters
      On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the `caBundleFile` `caBundleDir` parameters. So, if you are using `caBundleFile` or `caBundleDir`, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using `caBundleFile`) or in the same directory (when using `caBundleDir`):

    * The proxy certificate (because it's an `HTTPS` proxy).

    * The logging endpoint certificate (eg. `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`).

    * The infrastructure agent certificate (eg. `https://infra-api.newrelic.com`).

      You can check the certificates by running:

      ```bash
      # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com
      ```

    You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting [support](https://support.newrelic.com/).

<Callout variant="important">
  Trace logging generates a lot of data very quickly. To reduce disk space consumption and data ingest, when finished generating logs, be sure to set `level: info` (or lower).
</Callout>

    To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic:

    1. Edit your `newrelic-infra.yml` file.
    2. Enable logs forwarding to New Relic by adding the following config snippet:
       ```yml
       log:
         level: trace # Recommended: Helps with troubleshooting
         forward: true # Enables sending logs to New Relic
         format: json # Recommended: Enable agent logging in JSON format
         stdout: false # On Windows and systems that don't use `systemd` or where `journald` is inaccessible
       ```
    3. [Restart the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) to load the new settings.

 This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)) will continue in a non-verbose mode.

    id="too-many-files"
    title="Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux)"
  >
It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files:

* `Too many open files`
* `The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource`

The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above.

The underlying technology we use to forward logs, [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, **to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail**.

The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in `root` [running mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes/), and therefore must be run using the `root` user.

1. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified.

   ```bash
   ulimit -Hn
   ```

2. Add the following line to `/etc/security/limits.conf`. We specified a limit of `10100` here instead of just `10000` to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work.

   ```bash
   root    soft    nofile  10100  # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations
   ```

3. Add the following line to `/etc/pam.d/common-session` so that the previous limit is applied upon restart:

   ```bash
   session required pam_limits.so
   ```

4. Add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf` to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of `18192` here instead of just `10000` so that the `root` user will still have `8192` available inotify watches (the default value).

   ```bash
   fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192
   ```

5. Restart your system.

6. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running:

   ```bash
   ulimit -Sn                                    # Should return 10100
   cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches     # Should return 18192
   ```

    title="Install a particular Fluent Bit version (Linux)"
  >
    Prior to version [1.19.0](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1190) (or version [1.20.3](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1203) for SLES 12.5), the Linux infrastructure agent came bundled with a Fluent Bit binary. Starting in this version, Fluent Bit is now included as as a separate `recommended` package dependency.

    This means that you can install, update, or downgrade Fluent Bit separately from the agent. For your convenience, we have included several Fluent Bit packages in the same repository where the infrastructure lives, so you don't need to install any additional repositories to upgrade Fluent Bit.

    Note that the agent automatically installs Fluent Bit when you first install it, using the latest available version. After the first installation, you can upgrade Fluent Bit as you would normally do with any Linux package.

    You can list the available Fluent Bit versions by running:

    RPM:

    ```bash
    sudo yum check-update
    yum list fluent-bit --showduplicates
    ```

    DEB:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    apt-cache showpkg fluent-bit
    ```

    To upgrade to a particular Fluent Bit version, just run (in the following examples, version `2.0.8` is used):

    RPM:

    ```bash
    # Remove command only required when downgrading to a previous version
    sudo yum remove fluent-bit
    sudo yum install fluent-bit-2.0.8-1
    ```

    DEB:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install fluent-bit=2.0.8
    ```

    title="Rollback to fluent-bit 1.x after infrastructure agent 1.42.0 on Linux"
  >
    Please note that td-agent-bit is not available for the following distributions so rollbacks on them are not possible:

    - CentOS 9 Stream (including Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux)
    - RedHat 9
    - Ubuntu 22.04.x
    - Open Suse (SLES) 15.4
    - Amazon Linux 2023


    If you wish to revert to td-agent-bit, you can follow the steps outlined below:

    1. Open the file `/etc/newrelic-infra.yml` using your preferred text editor.
    2. Add the following line at the end of the file: `fluent_bit_exe_path: /opt/td-agent-bit/bin/td-agent-bit`.
    3. Save the changes.
    4. Restart the infrastructure agent by executing the following command: `sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra`.


    By completing these steps, the infrastructure agent will be configured to use td-agent-bit instead of fluent-bit.
