If your log data is already being monitored by Heroku's built-in [Logplex](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logplex) router, you can use our integration to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic. This integration uses [Heroku Syslog drains](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#syslog-drains). 

Forwarding your Heroku logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

## Create a Heroku Syslog drain [#create-syslog-drain]

To enable our log management capabilities, start by creating a Heroku Syslog drain.

1. Make sure your New Relic user account has the [Admin role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles) assigned to it.
2. Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).
3. Use the Heroku CLI to create a Syslog drain and attach it to the application you want to stream logs from, replacing `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name of your Heroku application.

  ```
  $ heroku drains:add syslog+tls://newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net:6515 -a <var>YOUR_APP_NAME</var>
  ```

4. Run the following command and copy the Heroku Syslog [drain token](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#drain-tokens) from the `token` attribute:

  ```
  $ heroku drains -a <var>YOUR_APP_NAME</var>--json

  ```

  ```
  {
  "addon": null,
  "created_at": "2018-12-04T00:59:46Z",
  "id": "906262a4-e151-45d2-b35a-a2dc0ea9e688",
  "token": "d.f14da5dc-106b-468d-b1bd-bed0ed9fa1e7",
  "updated_at": "2018-12-04T00:59:47Z",
  "url": "syslog+tls://newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net:6515
  }
  ```

## Register a Heroku Syslog drain [#register-syslog]

Next, you'll need to register your newly created Heroku Syslog drain in New Relic:

1. Log in to [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) and click **Add more data sources**.

  ![Add more data sources button](./images/add-data.png "Add more data sources button")

2. Click the **Heroku** tile under **Log ingestion**.

  ![Heroku tile](./images/heroku-tile.png "Heroku tile")

3. Choose the New Relic account to stream your Heroku application logs to, and click **Continue**.
4. Paste your newly created Heroku drain token in the **Heroku drain token** field.
5. Click **Add Heroku drain log** to complete registration.

Heroku currently doesn't support customizing the format of logs sent from Logplex. For more information, see [Heroku's log format documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#log-format).

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Explore logging data across your platform with the [New Relic One UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Heroku Syslog documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#syslog-drains). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
