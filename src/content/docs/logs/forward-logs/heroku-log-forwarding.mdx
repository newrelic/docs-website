If your log data is already being monitored by Heroku's built-in [Logplex](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logplex) router, you can use our integration to forward and enrich your log data in New Relic.

Forwarding your Heroku logs to New Relic will give you enhanced <InlinePopover type="logs"/> capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data.

We currently support [Heroku HTTPS drains](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains) and [Heroku Syslog drains](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#syslog-drains).

Using the Heroku HTTPS drains you will be able to add custom metadata to your logs. That way, you can set different attributes for each of your drains like the Application name or any other attribute you may need. Also, the whole process of registering new drains and deleting them is easier that with syslog.

Heroku Syslog drains on the counterpart doesn't allow you to add this custom metadata so it's harder to differentiate between the configured drains on the logs.

## Heroku HTTPS drains [#heroku-https-drains]

To configure this type of drain:

1. Ensure you have the [All Product Admin Role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles).
2. Go to the [New Relic Marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace).
3. Under <DNT>**Logging**</DNT>, click the `Heroku` tile. You can also search for it using the search bar.
4. If you have multiple accounts, select the account to which you want to send the logs.
5. Optional: Click <DNT>**Add metadata**</DNT> if you want to add custom metadata to the log drain and fill up the list with the key pairs you need.
6. Give your application a name. You'll use it to find your data later.
7. Copy the Heroku CLI command to your clipboard clicking the <DNT>**Copy to clipboard**</DNT> button.
8. Go to your terminal in the directory where you have the Heroku CLI set up. If you’re using Windows VM, use the traditional command prompt instead of Git Bash.
9. Run the command in your terminal.
10. Optional: click <DNT>**Test for logs**</DNT> if you want to check if logs are reaching New Relic.

## Heroku Syslog drains [#heroku-syslog-drain]

We suggest you use [Heroku HTTPS drains](#heroku-https-drains) whenever possible as they're simple to install, remove and also allows adding custom attributes to your logs.

### Create a Heroku Syslog drain [#create-syslog-drain]

We recommend you use Heroku HTTPS drains because they're simple to set up and because they let you add attributes to your logs. But if you need to use a syslog drain, here's the procedure:

1. Ensure you have the [Admin role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).

2. Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

3. Use the Heroku CLI to create a Syslog drain and attach it to the application you want to stream logs from, replacing `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name of your Heroku application.

   ```shell
   heroku drains:add syslog+tls://newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net:6515 -a YOUR_APP_NAME
   ```

   If you're located in Europe, run this command instead:

   ```shell
   heroku drains:add syslog+tls://newrelic.syslog.eu.nr-data.net:6515 -a YOUR_APP_NAME
   ```

4. Run the following command and copy the Heroku Syslog [drain token](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#drain-tokens) from the `token` attribute:

   ```shell
   heroku drains -a YOUR_APP_NAME --json
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "addon": null,
     "created_at": "2018-12-04T00:59:46Z",
     "id": "906262a4-e151-45d2-b35a-a2dc0ea9e688",
     "token": "d.f14da5dc-106b-468d-b1bd-bed0ed9fa1e7",
     "updated_at": "2018-12-04T00:59:47Z",
     "url": "syslog+tls://newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net:6515"
   }
   ```

### Register a Heroku syslog drain [#register-syslog]

Next, you'll need to register your newly created Heroku Syslog drain in New Relic:

1. Ensure you have the [admin role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).
2. Go to the [New Relic Marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace).
3. Under <DNT>**Logging**</DNT>, click the `Heroku (syslog)` tile. You can also search for it using the search bar.
4. If you have multiple accounts, select the account in which you want to register the drain token.
5. Paste your newly created Heroku drain token in the <DNT>**Heroku drain token**</DNT> field.
6. Click <DNT>**Add Heroku drain log**</DNT> to complete the registration.

  Heroku currently doesn't support customizing the format of logs sent from Logplex. For more information, see [Heroku's log format documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#log-format).

### Delete a Heroku syslog drain token mapping [#delete-syslog-drain]

You can delete Heroku syslog drain token mapping either via the New Relic UI or via API.

To delete a Heroku syslog drain token mapping via the UI:

1. Ensure you have the [admin role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).
2. Go to the [New Relic Marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace).
3. Under <DNT>**Logging**</DNT>, click the `Heroku (syslog)` tile. You can also search for it using the search bar.
4. If you have multiple accounts, select the account that contains the drain token mappings you wish to delete and click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>. Otherwise, go to step 6.
5. Find the drain token mapping you want to delete and click the vertical three-dot icon next it. Next, click <DNT>**Delete Heroku drain token**</DNT>.
6. Your Heroku drain token mapping is deleted.

To delete a Heroku syslog drain token mapping via REST API:

1. Find or generate a <InlinePopover type="userKey"/>.

2. Run the command below to retrieve a list of Heroku drain token mappings from your New Relic account, making sure to update values for [`YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY`](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) and [`YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID`](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id):

   ```shell
   curl -H 'api-key: YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY' https://log-syslog-configuration-api.service.newrelic.com/heroku-account-mappings?accountId=YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID
   ```

   The formatted result looks something like this:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "herokuMappingId": 1549,
       "drainToken": "YOUR_DRAIN_TOKEN",
       "nrApiInsertKey": "YOUR_DRAIN_TOKEN_NR_API_KEY",
       "createdAt": "2022-05-13T07:47:23",
       "createdBy": "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
     }
   ]
   ```

   You need the `herokuMappingId` for each drain token that you want to remove.

3. To delete a drain token, run the command below. Make sure to update values for [`YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY`](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key), [`YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID`](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/), and the `herokuMappingId` you retrieved in the last step:

   ```shell
   curl -X DELETE -H 'api-key: YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY' https://log-syslog-configuration-api.service.newrelic.com/heroku-account-mappings/<herokuMappingId>?accountId=YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID
   ```

When you're done, the API returns an HTTP 204 response and the drain token mapping is deleted.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [Our logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

* Explore logging data across your platform with [our logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) capabilities.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [Heroku Syslog documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#syslog-drains). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
