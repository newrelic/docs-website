## Problem

When you deploy a new host or server, or make other application changes, you want to immediately see how your system responds to these changes. You need to view your log messages as they arrive in real time.

## Solution

To focus on messages as they arrive in real time, enable live tail logging:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. Enter a query to focus on the type of log info you need, then click **Query logs**. An example query:

   ```
   Find logs where annotations.restartRequested:"2020-12-23T18:00:00Z"
   ```
3. On the right, click **Live tail** to enable <Icon name="fe-play-circle"/> or disable <Icon name="fe-pause-circle"/> it.
