## Problem

You're not seeing expected log data in the New Relic UI after ten minutes of installing the infrastructure agent, the <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent, or setting up log forwarding.

## Solutions

If no data appears after you set up a log-reporting solution and wait about five minutes, try the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Logs troubleshooting
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Infrastructure and APM agents
      </td>

      <td>
These agents are designed to automatically report log data. This is referred to as [logs-in-context](/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context). If you don't see that data, or want to do additional configuration, some options: 

For APM: 
* Review [our docs on enabling APM logs-in-context](/docs/logs/logs-context/get-started-logs-context).
* Make sure your APM agent is a version that supports logs-in-context. Here are details on supported agents and versions:
  * Java logs in context (agent v7.6.0 or higher)
      * Log4j1 1.2.17 or higher
      * Log4j 2.6 or higher

        If you've set up log forwarding, ensure you've installed a [compatible log forwarder](/docs/logs/forward-logs/).

      <td>
        Status codes
      </td>

      <td>
        Check the response status code being returned from the New Relic log collection endpoint. For example, you might see:

        ```
        HTTP Error 403: Forbidden. Review your license key.
        ```

        This error means that you're using an invalid security key. New Relic requires a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> to enable log shipping.

        An `HTTP 202` response indicates success.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Errors
      </td>

      <td>
        Run a query using the [`NrIntegrationErrors` event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror/) to see if any errors are related to logging. For example, look for messages like:

        ```
        Error unmarshalling message payload
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Query `Log`
      </td>

      <td>
        Try querying the `Log` data type:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM Log
        ```

        If no data appears in the query builder, then no data will appear in the **Logs** UI. For more information, see [our docs about data query options](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data).
