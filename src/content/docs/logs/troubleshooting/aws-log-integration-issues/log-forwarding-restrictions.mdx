New Relic has the following restrictions with AWS integration for log forwarding when ingesting logs via S3 or Firehose:

### For ingesting AWS logs from S3 [#s3-restrictions]
* The log file size should be less that 80 MB.
* The size of a single log line should be less than 8 MB.
* Log lines between 1mb and 8mb will be split into multiple messages and forwarded to New Relic.
* New Relic currently doesn't support client JSON or log line parsing.
* New Relic currently supports only `Gzip` and `Bzip2` compression formats for log files. It processes files in other compressed formats as uncompressed files.
### For ingesting logs from CloudWatch [#cloudwatch-restrictions]
* New Relic currently doesn't support client JSON or log line parsing.
* New Relic currently supports only [Lambda layers](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-layers) for parsing logic.
