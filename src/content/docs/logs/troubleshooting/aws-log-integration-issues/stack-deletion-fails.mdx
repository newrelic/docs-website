## Problem

When deleting a CloudFormation stack, it may fail due to various reasons.

## Solution

Possible reason and its solution:

* If the S3 buckets created by the stack (e.g., for Firehose error logs) is not empty, then it cannot be deleted. archive the contents and then retry deleting the stack.
