## Problem

Creating a CloudFormation stack may fail due to various reasons.

## Solution

Possible reasons and their solutions:

* The IAM role you have selected during the CloudFormation stack creation may not have sufficient [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html).
* If you did not select an IAM role, make sure your account has the required [permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#logs).
* If the failure message appears as following, delete or rename the existing resources with that name, and retry.

  `Resource type {resource-name} with identifier {resource-identifier-name} already exists.`

* Check the output of the nested CloudFormation stacks to identify potential errors.
* Ensure the selected S3 buckets don’t have event notifications on any object creation events.
* Ensure the selected CloudWatch log groups don’t have similar subscription filters.
