## Problem

Logs are not appearing in New Relic for a CloudWatch via Firehose integration setup.

## Solution

Possible reasons and their solutions:

* For S3 via Lambda or CloudWatch via Lambda integrations, the `CUSTOM_META_DATA` environment variable may not be set, or it may not have a valid JSON value. Verify it.
* For CloudWatch via Firehose, the key-value pairs may not be set correctly. Ensure your key-value pairs are present under <DNT>**Parameters**</DNT>.
* Your key names may overlap with forbidden keywords.
