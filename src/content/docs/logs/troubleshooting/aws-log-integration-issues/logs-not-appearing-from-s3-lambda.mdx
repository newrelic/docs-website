## Problem

Logs are not appearing in New Relic for a S3 via Lambda integration setup.

## Solution

Possible reasons and their solutions:

* Verify the possible reasons in [Logs not appearing from CloudWatch vai Lambda](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-cloudwatch-lambda).
* S3 files may not adhere to the [Log forwarding restrictions](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/log-forwarding-restrictions) in New Relic.
* The `NewRelicServerlessLogForwarder` may not have the S3 trigger. Check the output of the nested CloudFormation stacks, and add it.
