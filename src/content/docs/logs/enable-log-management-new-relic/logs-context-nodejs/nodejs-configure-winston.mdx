Use our [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-dotnet-serilog]

To use New Relic logs in context with Winston, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Node.js agent 6.2.0 or higher: [Install](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/update-nodejs-agent)
* [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) version 3.0.0 or higher

## Configure logs in context with log monitoring [#configure-logs]

To configure logs in context with Winston:

1. [Enable log monitoring](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Node.js agent](#nodejs-extension).
3. [Configure the Winston extension](#enable-logs-winston).
4. [Check for logging data.](#test-extension-nodejs)

## Enable log monitoring [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log monitoring](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Node.js agent [#nodejs-extension]

[Install](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/update-nodejs-agent) to the most recent Node.js agent version, and [enable Distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure the Winston extension [#enable-logs-Winston]

To configure logs in context with the Winston extension, complete the following steps:

1. To install the New Relic Winston log enricher, enter the following command into your terminal or command line interface:

   ```
   npm install @newrelic/winston-enricher
   ```
2. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the `newrelicFormatter` as shown below:

   ```
   // index.js
   require('newrelic')
   const newrelicFormatter = require('@newrelic/winston-enricher')
   ```

   The New Relic formatter can be used individually or combined with other formatters as the final format.

   ```
   format: winston.format.combine(
     winston.format.label({label: 'test'}),
     newrelicFormatter()
   )
   ```

## Check for logging data [#test-extension-java]

To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following:

1. Includes `trace.id` and `span.id` fields
2. Is properly-formatted JSON lines

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) using the [query operator](/docs/new-relic-logs-query-syntax) `has: span.id/trace.id`.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**

Not all log data in a message or for a specific attribute is being displayed.

**Cause**

The stack trace will be written to the `error.stack` property. To accommodate the 4000 character log line limit for New Relic Logs, the stack and trace properties will be removed and the `message`, `error.message` and `error.stack` values will be truncated to 1024 characters.

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
