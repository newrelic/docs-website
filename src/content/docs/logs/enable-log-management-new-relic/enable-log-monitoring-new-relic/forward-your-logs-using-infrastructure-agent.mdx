You can forward your logs to New Relic using our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic). This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data.

## Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent [#enable]

To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent:

1. Start by checking [what you need](#requirements).
2. [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic), version 1.11.4 or higher.
3. [Configure](#configure) your log sources and other [parameters](#parameters) in the `logging.d` directory.
4. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.
5. [Explore your log data](#find-data) in the Logs UI and benefit from the [log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent](#automatically-inserted-attributes).

## What you need [#requirements]

The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher
* **Windows:** Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads): [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) or [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).
* OpenSSL library 1.1.0 (or higher) is a requirement for `infra-agent` v1.16.4 or higher. Operating systems previous to year 2016 (like Suse12 or CentOS7) need to update OpenSSL from 1.0.* to 1.1.*. 

The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized agents.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install]

Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To [install and run the agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic), use a [package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager) (Linux) or the [MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer) (Windows).

If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our [tutorial to install the package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-agent-linux-using-package-manager).

## Test log forwarding [#test]

To quickly check that the log forwarding feature works, follow these steps.

1. If you're running the infrastructure monitoring agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), make sure that the user executing `nri-agent` has read permissions for the data sources.
2. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder:

   * Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d\`
3. Create a configuration file (for example, `logs.yml`) with this content:

   * Linux example:

     ```
     # Remember to only use spaces for indentation
     logs:
       - name: "test_log"
         file: /var/log/test.log
     ```
   * Windows example:

     ```
     # Remember to only use spaces for indentation
     logs:
       - name: "test_log"
         file: 'C:\ProgramData\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.log'
     ```
4. Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file:

   ```
   echo "This is a test message." >> <var>/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE</var>
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   echo "This is a test message." >> /var/log/test.log
   ```
5. Search [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for `test message`.

## Configure the infrastructure agent [#configure]

Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. You can add as many config files as you want, and set as many sources as you need per config file.

To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature:

1. Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder:

   * Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d\`
2. Create a configuration file with the [parameters](#parameters) you need. Use our [sample config file](#sample-configuration-file) as reference.

The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart it.

## Log forwarding parameters [#parameters]

The log forwarder config supports the following parameters (for examples, see the [sample configuration](#running-modes)).

### `name`

Name of the log or logs.

### `attributes`

List of [custom attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insights-custom-data-requirements-limits), as key-value pairs, that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then [query](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). For example, you can [enable built-in parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing) by setting the `logtype` attribute.

**Example:**

```
...
 - name: tcp-simple-test 
    tcp:
      uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234
      format: none
      separator: \t
    attributes: # You can add custom attributes to any source of logs
      <mark>tcpFormat: none</mark>
      <mark><a href="/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing">logtype</a>: nginx # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/new-relic-logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing</mark>
      <mark>someOtherAttribute: associatedValue</mark>
```

### `file`

Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to `tail -f shell`.

Your `file` can point to a specific log file or multiple ones by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, `/logs/*.log`

**Example:**

```
logs:
  - name: file-with-attributes
    <mark>file: /var/log/test.log</mark> # Path to a single file or pattern
    pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries
```

Wildcards can also be used in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories.

**Example:**

```
logs:
  - name: docker-logs
    <mark>file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log</mark> # Path to multiple folders and files
    pattern: redis # Regular expression to filter log entries
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached.
</Callout>

We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's `/etc/security/limits.conf` file:

```
root soft nofile 65536
root hard nofile 65536
*soft nofile 65536
*hard nofile 65536
```

Once you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied.

### `systemd` (Linux only) [#systemd]

Service name. Once the `systemd` input is activated, log messages are collected from the `journald` daemon in Linux environments.

This input type requires the agent to run in [root mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes).

**Example:**

```
logs:
  - name: systemd-example
    <mark>systemd: cupsd</mark>
```

### `syslog` (Linux only) [#syslog]

Syslog data source.

**Parameters:**

* `uri:` Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol:
  * TCP/UDP network sockets: `[tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`
  * Unix domain sockets: `unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path`
* `parser:` Syslog parser. Default is `rfc3164`. Use `rfc5424` if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: `rfc3164` currently does not work on SuSE.
* `unix_permissions:` default is `0644` for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use `0666` to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk.

When running the agent in [privileged mode](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), ports and sockets must be available or owned by `nri-agent`, with `0666` file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets.

```
logs:
  # TCP network socket
  - name: syslog-tcp-test
    syslog:
      uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
      parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164
  # UDP network socket
  - name: syslog-udp-test
    syslog:
      uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
    max_line_kb: 35
  # Unix TCP domain socket
  - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test
    syslog:
      uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test
      unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk
  # Unix UDP domain socket
  - name: syslog-unix-udp-test
    syslog:
      uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test
      parser: rfc5424
```

### `tcp`

Logs retrieved over TCP connections.

**Parameters:**

* `uri:` TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is `tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT`
* `format:` format of the data. It can be `json` or `none`.
* `separator:` If `format: none` is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: `\n`).

```
logs:
  - name: tcp-simple-test 
    tcp:
      uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
      format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp'
      separator: \t # String for separating raw text entries
    max_line_kb: 32
  - name: tcp-json-test 
    tcp:
      uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format
      format: json
```

### `max_line_kb`

Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is `128`.

### `winlog`

Collect events from Windows log channels.

**Parameters:**

* `channel:` name of the channel logs will be collected from.
* `collect-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported.
* `exclude-eventids:` a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported.

All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the `collect-eventids` and `exclude-eventids` sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account.

Add event IDs or ranges to `collect-eventids` or `exclude-eventids` to forward or drop specific events. `exclude-eventids` takes precedence over `collect-eventids` if the same event ID is present in both sections.

**Example:**

```
logs:
 # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters.
  - name: windows-security
    winlog:
       channel: Security
       collect-eventids:
        - 4624
        - 4265
        - 4700-4800
       exclude-eventids:
        - 4735
 
 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels
  - name: windows-application
    winlog: 
       channel: Application
  - name: windows-system
    winlog: 
       channel: System
  - name: windows-pshell
    winlog: 
       channel: Windows Powershell
  - name: scom
    winlog: 
       channel: Operations Manager

 # Entry for Windows Defender Logs
  - name: windows-defender
    winlog:
       channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
 
 # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs
  - name: windows-clustering
    winlog:
       channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational
 
 # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing
  - name: iis-log
    file: C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\w3svc.log
    attributes:
      logtype: iis_w3c
```

### `pattern`

Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format `none`) sources.

This field works in a way similar to `grep -E` in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either `WARN` or `ERROR` using:

```
- name: only-records-with-warn-and-error
  file: /var/log/logFile.log
  <mark>pattern: WARN|ERROR</mark>
```

No filtering is applied by default.

### `fluentbit` [#fb]

External [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the Infrastructure agent.

The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the `logging.d` directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate `[INPUT]`, `[FILTER]` and `[OUTPUT]` sections. Optionally, it will also declare an `@INCLUDE` in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the `fluentbit` option.

The runtime file does not define a [`[SERVICE]` section](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/configuration-file#config_section), leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own `[SERVICE]` section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the `fluentbit` option.

**Parameters:**

`config_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs.

`parsers_file:` path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: `rfc3164`, `rfc3164-local` and `rfc5424`.

### Sample configuration file [#running-modes]

Here is an example of a `logging.d/` configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, [see the infrastructure agent repository](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/tree/master/assets/examples/logging).

## View your log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and data is being collected, you should see data in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql); for example, you can execute a query like this:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

## Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent [#automatically-inserted-attributes]

The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while other depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the Log Forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Attribute name
      </th>

      <th>
        Inserting conditions
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `entity.guids`
      </td>

      <td>
        Always inserted
      </td>

      <td>
        The infrastructure agent inserts the [Entity GUID](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/span/entityguid) assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the `entity.guids` field.

        Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the `entity.guids` field contains both the Entity GUID of infrastructure as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter.

## Troubleshoot log forwarding [#troubleshoot]

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow [standard troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).

### No data appears when tailing a file [#no-data]

The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes), make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running `nri-agent`.

<CollapserGroup>

    title="Example: checking file access under Linux"
  >
    Let's check whether the file `/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log` can be monitored by the `nri-agent` user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the `namei` command:

    ```
    sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs
    logFile.log - No such file or directory
    ```

    This command failed because the file is not visible to the `nri-agent` user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the `restrictedLogs` directory is missing the execution flag for `others"`.

    We can fix this by executing:

    ```
    sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs
    ```

    And then check for file access again:

    ```
    # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    drwxr-xr-x root root /
    drwxr-xr-x root root var
    drwxrwxr-x root syslog log
    drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs
    -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log
    ```

    The file is now visible to the `nri-agent` user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the `nri-agent` user. To check this, use:

    ```
    # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log
    head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied
    ```

    In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the `others` group (users other than `vagrant` and the `vagrant` user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to `others`, but the application could change these permissions upon restart.

    To avoid this, a better approach is to add the `nri-agent` user to the `vagrant` user group.

</CollapserGroup>

### No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket [#no-data]

The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the Infrastructure agent in [privileged or non-privileged modes](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes):

* If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the `nri-agent` user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (`666`) so that other users than `nri-agent` can write to them.
* If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port `80`, for example).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow [standard log management troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).

### No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy

As explained in the [infrastructure agent configuration guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#proxy), the `proxy` parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form <var>https</var>://<var>user</var>:<var>password</var>@<var>hostname</var>:<var>port</var>. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs:

```
[ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \"hostname:port\": 
 first path segment in URL cannot contain colon
```

To solve this problem, check your `newrelic-infra.yml` file, and ensure the `proxy` parameter adheres to this form.

### Send the agent's logs to New Relic [#agent-logs]

The infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to [New Relic](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs). This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting [support](https://support.newrelic.com/).

To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic:

1. Edit your `newrelic-infra.yml` file.
2. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding [`verbose: 3`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#verbose)

   <Callout variant="important">
     On Windows and systems that don't use `systemd` or where `journald` is inaccessible, `verbose:3` causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to `verbose:0` to prevent this.
   </Callout>
3. **(Recommended):** Enable agent logging in JSON format to `log_format: json`.
4. [Restart the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) so that the new settings can be loaded.

This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping [Windows log events](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent#winlog) or when accessing a particular log file.

In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder:

1. Set `verbose` to a value other than `0`.
2. Add the following configuration option: `trace: ["log.fw"]`.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Check whether you are using the [`fluentbit`](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent#fb) option. When setting `verbose: 3` **and** `trace: ["log.fw"]`, ensure that you don't define any `[OUTPUT]` section pointing to `stdout` in an external Fluent Bit configuration file,
</Callout>

### Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent [#no-fb]
For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: 

1. See if `infra-agent`has started Fluent Bit by doing 
```
    ps -aux | grep fluent-bit
```

2. If it isn't running go to `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging` and run 

```
    ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout
```
3. If you get this error: `error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher. 

### Runtime error on Windows [#windows-runtime-error]

One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows:

```
The code execution cannot proceed because <mark>VCRUNTIME140.dll</mark> was not found.
```

OR

```
error="exit status 3221225781" process=log-forwarder
```

This is caused by a missing DLL.

To solve the issue, install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads): [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) or [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
