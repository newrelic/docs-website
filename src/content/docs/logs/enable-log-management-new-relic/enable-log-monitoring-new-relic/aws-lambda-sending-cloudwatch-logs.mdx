You can send your [CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, `newrelic-log-ingestion`, which can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository.

## Requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use our CloudWatch logs Lambda function, you only need a [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).

## Install and configure the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function [#install-function]

<Callout variant="tip">
  The following setup shows one approach to configuring environment variables. You can also configure them from the [Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html) page.
</Callout>

Complete the following:

1. Open the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications "Link opens in a new window.") in your browser.
2. Search for `newrelic` and check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** to find `newrelic-log-ingestion`.
3. Open the `newrelic-log-ingestion` details and click **Deploy**.
4. Scroll to the **Application settings** and configure log forwarding using the following environment variables:

   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
           Key
         </th>

         <th style={{ width: "185px" }}>
           Description
         </th>

         <th>
           Value
         </th>
       </tr>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>
           `DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED`
         </td>

         <td>
           A boolean to determine if you want to output debug messages in the CloudWatch console. **Optional**.
         </td>

         <td>
           To turn on debug logs, set this to `true`. By default, it is `false`.
         </td>
       </tr>
       
       <tr>
         <td>
           `LICENSE_KEY`
         </td>

         <td>
           [New Relic License key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) is used for sending data to New Relic Infrastructure and Logs. **Required**.
         </td>

         <td>
           Your New Relic license key.
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           `LOGGING_ENABLED`
         </td>

         <td>
           Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. **Required**.
         </td>

         <td>
           To turn on logging, set this to `true`.
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           `NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT`
         </td>

         <td>
           New Relic ingestion endpoint for Logs. **Required**.
         </td>

         <td>
           Two endpoints are available:

           * US: `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`
           * EU: `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           `NR_TAGS`
         </td>

         <td>
           Specify tags to be added to all log events. **Optional**.
         </td>

         <td>
           Each tag is composed of a colon delimited key and value. Multiple key-value pairs are semi-colon delimited, for example, `env:prod;team:myTeam`
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
5. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles and then click **Deploy**.

Once the process completes, follow the steps below in [Create a Lambda trigger](#create-trigger) to link your Lambda function to CloudWatch Logs.

## Create a Lambda trigger [#create-trigger]

To get your logs streaming to New Relic you will need to attach a trigger to the Lambda:

1. From the left side menu, select **Functions**.
2. Find and select the previously created `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
3. Under **Designer**, click **Add Triggers**, and select **Cloudwatch Logs** from the dropdown.
4. Select the the appropriate **Log group** for your application.
5. Enter a name for your filter.
6. Optional: Enter a [filter pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).
7. Check the **Enable trigger** checkbox, then click **Add** to create the trigger.

## Configure retries (optional) [#config-retries]

You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. Recommended number is 3 retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters:

<Callout variant="tip">
  Be aware that more number of retries can make the function run for longer time and therefore increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. On the contrary, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss.
</Callout>

```
MAX_RETRIES = 3  # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data
INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1  # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed
BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2  # Time multiplier between the retries
As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds.
```

## Resources created by the SAM template [#sam-resources]

There are few resources that will be created when you create the application from the repository:

* The Lambda function itself
* A Role used to give execution permissions to the Lambda function based in CloudWatch Logs.

All other lambda configurations not listed in the steps above can be left as the defaults.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql). For example, you can execute a query like this:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
