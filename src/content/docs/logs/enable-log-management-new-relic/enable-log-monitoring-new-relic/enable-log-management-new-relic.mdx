[New Relic's log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) allows you to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. Read on to learn how to enable this feature and start using it.

## Requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use log management, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Your New Relic account's [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key)
* A [compatible log forwarding plugin installed](#enable-logs)
* Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the [CIDR range](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/networks/#infrastructure) that matches your [region](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers)

The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name `log-api.newrelic.com` or `log-api.eu.newrelic.com`.

## Enable log management in New Relic [#enable]

There are several ways of bringing your logs into New Relic:

* [Use the New Relic infrastructure agent](#infra-agent)
* [Use log forwarding plugins (like Fluentd)](#log-forwarding)
* [Use the New Relic Logs API](#enable-api)

### Enable log management using the infrastructure agent [#infra-agent]

You can forward your logs to [New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs) using the infrastructure agent, our lightweight data collector, without having to use additional software.

For more information, see [Forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure-agent).

### Enable log management in New Relic using a log forwarding solution [#log-forwarding]

You can use any of these solutions to forward your logs to New Relic:

* [Infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure-agent)
* [Kubernetes plugin](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs-kubernetes)
* [AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3)
* [AWS CloudWatch plugin](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs-aws-cloudwatch)
* [AWS Kinesis Firehose](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose)
* [AWS FireLens plugin](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs-firelens)
* [Fluent Bit plugin](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs-fluent-bit)
* [Fluentd plugin](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs-fluentd)
* [Logstash plugin](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs-logstash)
* [Vector plugin](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/vector-plugin-logs)
* [Heroku Log Streaming](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/heroku-log-forwarding/)
* [Syslog TCP Endpoint](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic/)

### Enable using the Logs API [#enable-api]

If you prefer to connect to New Relic without installing a plugin, New Relic offers HTTP input integration. This will allow you to send your monitored log data directly to New Relic via the Log API.

For more information, see [Introduction to Log API](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs-api).

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable New Relic Logs, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
