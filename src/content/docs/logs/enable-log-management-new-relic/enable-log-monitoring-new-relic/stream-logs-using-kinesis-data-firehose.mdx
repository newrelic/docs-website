You can send your logs to New Relic using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html), a service which can stream data in real time to a variety of destinations, including our platform. Here we explain how to enable this integration.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To forward logs to New Relic using Kinesis Data Firehose, you need a New Relic [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).

<Callout variant="important">
  Currently, our endpoint only supports accounts in our [US data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers).
</Callout>

## Create the delivery stream for New Relic [#firelens-plugin]

When [creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html), you can select New Relic as the destination:

1. In the AWS Management Console, go to **Amazon Kinesis**.
2. Select **Kinesis Data Firehose** and click **Create delivery stream**.
3. Enter a name for the stream and select your data source.
4. When selecting the destination, click **Third-party partner** and then **New Relic.**

5. Add the following endpoint under **HTTP endpoint URL**:

   ```
   https://aws-api.newrelic.com/firehose/v1
   ```
6. Paste your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) in the **API key** field.
7. Configure and review the remaining settings.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
