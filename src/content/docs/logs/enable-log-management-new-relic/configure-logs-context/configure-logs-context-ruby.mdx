Logs in context for the Ruby agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

## Set up your Ruby app [#configure-ruby]

To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Ruby:

1. Make sure you have already [set up logging in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/). This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic.
2. [Install](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent/) or [update](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/update-ruby-agent/) to the latest Ruby agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/). Use [Ruby agent version 6.7.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/) for logs in context.
3. For Rails applications, use a [supported Rails version](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-requirements-supported-frameworks/#web_frameworks).
4. Configure logs in context for Ruby.

  Rails logging is controlled by two components:
    * A logger you can customize by setting `config.logger`
    * A log formatter you can customize by setting `config.log_formatter`)
  
  In most cases, you should configure logs in context by setting `config.log_formatter` to the `DecoratingFormatter` in your Rails application. For more information about Rails configuration, see the [rubyonrails.org documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html).

  In your application's config, require `newrelic_rpm`, then add the following line:

  ```
  module ________
    class Application < Rails::Application

    ...

    config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new
    end
  end
  ```

  This configuration uses the New Relic formatter for log messages, but the remaining configuration is provided by the other Rails settings.

  New Relic's decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems:

  * [logging](https://rubygems.org/gems/logging)
  * [semantic logger](https://rubygems.org/gems/semantic_logger)
  * [rails_stdout_logger](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_stdout_logging)
  * [rails_12factor](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_12factor)

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="rails-adv-config"
    title="Rails advanced configuration"
  >

  If setting the `log_formatter` option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this:

  ```
  module ________
    class Application < Rails::Application

      ...

      config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new(
      "log/application.log", #etc...
      )
    end
  end
  ```

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="enable-non-rails"
    title="Ruby configuration without Rails"
  >

  For non-Rails applications, use the `DecoratingLogger` in place of the Ruby standard `::Logger`, like this:

  ```
  logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new(
    'log/application.log', #etc...
  )
  ...
  
  logger.info(...)
  ```
  The `DecoratingLogger` is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard `::Logger`. Their constructors accept the same parameters.

  To configure this extension with the [lograge gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/lograge), no additional configuration is required.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="adv-ruby-config"
    title="Other logging extensions"
  >
  To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation or with your own custom logger, use the `DecoratingFormatter`. For example:

  ```
  module ________
    class Application < Rails::Application

      ...

      config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new(
        $stdout,
        formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new
      )
    end
  end
  ```

  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

5. To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your [logs data in New Relic One](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) using the query operator `has:span.id has:trace.id`.

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain `trace.id` and `span.id` fields.

If you have configured your logging in `/config/application.rb` or in `/config/environments/development.rb`, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this:

```
{"entity.name":"your_app_name","entity.type":"SERVICE","hostname":"79bcbf8d","trace.id":"79bcbf8d","span.id":"00fc7d46","timestamp":1567701375543,"message":"example log message one","log.level":"DEBUG"}
{"entity.name":"your_app_name","entity.type":"SERVICE","hostname":"79bcbf8d","trace.id":"79bcbf8d","span.id":"6754870b","timestamp":1567702843604,"message":"example log message two","log.level":"DEBUG"}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/). Also, if you see JSON logs in your application's output, but your query does not return logs, check your [log forwarder](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs).

If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like `trace.id` and `span.id`, there may be a problem with your log forwarding extension. In this situation:

* Check that the application is using a [supported logging framework](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/).
* Check that your [logging configuration](#adv-ruby-config) has been applied to all the environments where you want to forward and enrich the log data being sent to New Relic.
* Check that another logger is not configured later in your application's configuration.

Logs in context for Ruby does not support tagged logging. If you are initializing your logger with a `log_tags` argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs.

## What's next? [#what-next]

After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
