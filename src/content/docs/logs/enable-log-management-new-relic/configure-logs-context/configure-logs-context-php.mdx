Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

## Set up your PHP app [#configure-php]

To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP:

1. Make sure you have already [set up logging in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/). This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic.
2. [Install](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview/) or [update](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/update-php-agent/) to the latest PHP agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/). Use [PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/) for logs in context.
3. Install [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) version 1 or 2, or use a [compatible log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/#log-forwarding) if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic.
4. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used.

  You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the [`newrelic/monolog-enricher` package](https://packagist.org/packages/newrelic/monolog-enricher).

  In most cases, use the `Processor` and `Handler` classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in `BufferHandler`.

  * The `Processor` adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate.
  * The `Handler` sends the log records to New Relic Logs.
  * The `BufferHandler` ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible.

  At the point where you create the `Monolog\Logger` object, add the following `pushProcessor` and `pushHandler` calls to add the `Processor` and `Handler`:

  ```
  <?php

  use Monolog\Handler\BufferHandler;
  use Monolog\Logger;
  use NewRelic\Monolog\Enricher\{Handler, Processor};

  $log = new Logger('log');
  $log->pushProcessor(new Processor);
  $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler));
  ```

  <Callout variant="tip">
  You can use the `Processor` and `Handler` in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers.
  </Callout>

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="php-advanced"
    title="PHP configuration with other log forwarders"
  >

  If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the `Processor` and `Formatter` solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the `Handler`.

  You will need to be using a handler that supports the `setFormatter()` method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs.

  Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders:
  
  ```
  <?php

  use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
  use Monolog\Logger;
  use NewRelic\Monolog\Enricher\{Formatter, Processor};

  $log = new Logger('log');
  $log->pushProcessor(new Processor);

  $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr');
  $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter);
  $log->pushHandler($handler);

  ```
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

5. To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your [logs data in New Relic One](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) using the query operator `has:span.id has:trace.id`.

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain `trace.id` and `span.id` fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

If the logs from your application do not include fields like `trace.id` and `span.id`, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation:

* Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing.
* Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not `syslog()`.
* Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from [bubbling](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/01-usage.md#core-concepts).

## What's next? [#what-next]

After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
