APM logs in context connects your logs with all of your telemetry data for your apps, hosts, and other entities. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly:

* Cut through the noise of thousands of logs when troubleshooting time-critical issues, so you automatically see only the most relevant logs.
* Navigate within multiple types of telemetry data, and have the data correlate back to the original issue.
* Easily drill down into more detailed information from the same place in the UI.
* Find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

For more information, including examples, learn how to get started with [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context).

## Logs in context options [#automatic]

In the Go agent, there are currently two options to configure APM logs in context to send your app's logs and linking metadata automatically to New Relic.  For more information about the application logging settings in the following procedure, see our documentation about [Go agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration/#application-logging).

  <Collapser
    id="1-agent"
    title="Option 1 (simplest): Let the agent collect and forward your logs."
  >
    This is the simplest approach, and it's a great choice for developers who may not have the access or interest in setting up a log forwarder, or for accounts that want to see the power of logs and other linking metadata in context of their apps, without a lot of set up.

    Using this option, the Go agent collects your logs and sends them to New Relic with attributes added that automatically link your logs to spans, traces, and other telemetry, making it easier to troubleshoot.

      <Collapser
        id="1-nrzerolog-ingestion"
        title="Zerolog plugin"
      >

        The nrzerolog plugin enables automatic logs in context ingestion with the zerolog logging framework. Once your application is configured to use it, the go-agent will automatically ingest any logs written in zerolog. This requires the installed go-agent version to be 3.17.0 or higher.

        1. Import the nrzerolog plugin:

```go
import (
  "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext-v2/nrzerolog"
  "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
  "github.com/rs/zerolog"
)
```

        2. Enable the collection of logs:

```go
app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
  newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
  newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true),
)
```

        3. Create a zerolog logger that is hooked with the nrlogrus plugin and collect logs:

  Collect a background log:

```go
logger := zerolog.New(os.Stdout)
nrHook := nrzerolog.NewRelicHook{
        App: app,
}
nrLogger := logger.Hook(nrHook)
nrLogger.Info().Msg("A Log Message")
```

  Collect a log inside of a transaction:

```go
logger := zerolog.New(os.Stdout)
txn := app.StartTransaction("My Transaction")
ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn)
nrHook := nrzerolog.NewRelicHook{
        App: app,
        Context: ctx,
}
nrLogger := logger.Hook(nrHook)
nrLogger.Info().Msg("A Log Message")
txn.End()
```

      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="2-nrlogrus-ingestion"
        title="Logrus plugin"
      >
        The nrlogrus plugin enables automatic logs in context ingestion with the logrus logging framework. Once your application is configured to use it, the go-agent will automatically ingest any logs written in logrus. This requires the installed go-agent version to be 3.18.0 or higher.

        1. Import the nrlogrus plugin:

```go
import (
  "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext-v2/nrlogrus"
  "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
  "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)
```

        2. Enable the collection of logs:

```go
app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
  newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
  newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true),
)
```

        3. Create a logrus logger that uses the nrlogrus formatter:

```go
log := logrus.New()
log.SetFormatter(nrlogrus.NewFormatter(app, &logrus.TextFormatter{}))
```

        4. Collect logs
        
        Once the new relic app is connected, and a logrus logger has been created that uses the nrlogrus formatter, any log written with that logger will be collected by the go-agent.

```go
log.Info("this log will be collected by the go agent")
```

        Collect a log inside of a transaction:

```go
txn := app.StartTransaction("example transaction")
txnLogger := log.WithContext(newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn))
txnLogger.Info("this log will be collected and tagged with additional metadata associating it with the current transaction and span")
txn.End()
```

        title="Manual instrumentation"
      >
        If you want to send your logs to New Relic through the agent, but the current logging plugins provided do not work for you, use the `RecordLog()` function. This feature requires go-agent version 3.17.0 or higher.

        Collect a background log: 

```go
func main() {
  app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
    newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
    newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
    newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true),
  )

  app.RecordLog(newrelic.LogData{
	  Message:   "A Background Log Message",
	  Severity:  "info",
  })
}
```

        Collect a log inside of a transaction:

```go
func main() {
  app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
    newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
    newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
    newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true),
  )

  txn := app.StartTransaction("my transaction")
  txn.RecordLog(newrelic.LogData{
    Message: "A Background Log Message",
	  Severity: "info",
  })
  txn.End()
}
```

      </Collapser>
      </CollapserGroup>

    **Optional adjustments:**

    Once log forwarding is enabled, you also have control over the maximum number of logs sent to New Relic every minute. The default value is 10,000. If more than 10,000 logs are received in a 60-second window, your logs will begin to be sampled.
    
    Set it to a higher number to receive more logs. Set it to a lower number to receive fewer logs. Any integer up to 100,000 is valid.

```go
app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
  newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
  newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingMaxSamplesStored(500),
)
```

  <Collapser
    id="2-manual-forwarding"
    title="Option 2: Manually forward and decorate logs"
  >

  If using a manual log forwarder is preferable, then make sure you have already [set up logging in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/). This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic.

    <Collapser
        id="1-logcontext-v2"
        title="logcontext-v2 plugins"
      >
    
    Some, and eventually all, logcontext-v2 plugins support decorating logs for use with a manual log forwarder. Currently, the following plugins support this feature in the following minimum versions of the go-agent:

    - logcontext-v2/nrlogrus: v3.18.0
    
    The installation and usage instructions for these plugins are identical to the steps required for automatic log forwarding. The only thing that needs to be changed are the agent config settings. Automatic log forwarding must be disabled, and local log decorating must be enabled.

```go
app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
  newrelic.ConfigAppName("Example App"),
  newrelic.ConfigFromEnvironment(),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(false),
  newrelic.ConfigAppLogDecoratingEnabled(true),
)
```

    <Collapser
        id="3-legacy-system"
        title="legacy logs in context"
      >
    
    This is the legacy logs in context solution for the Go agent. It will decorate your Logrus logs, then you can use a log forwarder to send them to New Relic.
    Follow these steps to set up logs in context with this method.

    1. [Install](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go/) or [update](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/update-go-agent/) to the latest Go agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/). Use [Go agent version 2.12 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes/) for logs in context.
    2. Install the [Logrus logging framework version 1.4.0 or higher](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) to enrich your log data.
    3. Import the following packages in files where Logrus is configured:

 ```go
 import (
   log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
   "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext/nrlogrusplugin"
   "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
 )
 ```
    4. Set the Logrus formatter to `nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter`:

```go
logger := log.New()
logger.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
```

       OR

       If you're using the Logrus standard logger:

```go
log.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
```

       The logger will now look for a `newrelic.Transaction` inside its context and decorate logs accordingly.
    5. Update your standard logging call to include contextual logging, and pass this to the logger.

       For example, instead of `logger.Info("Hello New Relic!")`, use

```go
ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn)
logger.WithContext(ctx).Info("Hello New Relic!")
```

       where `txn` is the current running transaction.
   
    6. To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your [logs data in New Relic](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) using the query operator `has:span.id has:trace.id`.
    
    If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain `trace.id` and `span.id` fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## Secure your data [#obfuscation]

Your logs may include sensitive information protected by HIPAA or other compliance protocols. By default we obfuscate number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers, but you may need to hash or mask additional information.

For more information, see our documentation about [obfuscation expressions and rules](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui/). You can hash or mask your log data by using the New Relic UI or by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API.

## What's next? [#what-next]

After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
