Logs in context for the Go agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

## Set up your Go app [#configure-plugin-go]

To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Go:

1. Make sure you have already [set up logging in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/). This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic.
2. [Install](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go/) or [update](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/update-go-agent/) to the latest Go agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/). Use [Go agent version 2.12 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes/) for logs in context.
3. Install the [Logrus logging framework version 1.4.0 or higher](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) to enrich your log data.
4. Configure logs in context for Go using the Logrus extension.

1. Import the following packages in files where Logrus is configured:

   ```
   import (
       log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
       "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext/nrlogrusplugin"
       "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
   )
   ```
2. Set the Logrus formatter to `nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter`:

   ```
   logger := log.New()
   logger.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
   ```

   OR

   If you're using the Logrus standard logger:

   ```
   log.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
   ```

   The logger will now look for a `newrelic.Transaction` inside its context and decorate logs accordingly.
3. Update your standard logging call to include contextual logging, and pass this to the logger.

   For example, instead of `logger.Info("Hello New Relic!")`, use

   ```
   ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn)
   logger.WithContext(ctx).Info("Hello New Relic!")
   ```

   where `txn` is the current running transaction.

  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

5. To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your [logs data in New Relic One](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) using the query operator `has:span.id has:trace.id`.

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain `trace.id` and `span.id` fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
