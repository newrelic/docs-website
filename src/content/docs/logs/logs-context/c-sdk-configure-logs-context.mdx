Logs in context is not available for apps monitored by the C SDK. Instead, you can build your own logging extension library by using the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api/). Make sure your app has distributed tracing enabled, so you can quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through upstream and downstream services.

To enable distributed tracing for apps monitored by the C SDK, [install](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/) or [update](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/update-your-c-sdk-library/) to the latest C SDK version. Distributed tracing requires [C SDK version 1.1.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-sdk-release-notes/).
