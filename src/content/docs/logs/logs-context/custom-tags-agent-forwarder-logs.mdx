New Relic APM language agents now allow you to opt-in to add your custom tags (labels) to agent-forwarded logs. 
With custom tags on logs, DevOps and platform engineers can filter, search, and correlate log data for faster and more efficient troubleshooting, improved performance, and optimized resource utilization.
