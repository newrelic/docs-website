Logs in context for the Python agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

## Set up your Python app [#configure-python]

To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python, you can use our manual installation option.

1. Make sure you have already [set up logging in New Relic](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/). This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic.
2. [Install](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/standard-python-agent-install/) or [update](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/update-python-agent) to the latest Python agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start/). Use [Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/) for logs in context.
3. Configure logs in context for your log handler.

    Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a `StreamHandler` which by default writes logs to `sys.stderr`, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the [Python.org documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html).

    ```
    # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter
    import logging
    from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter

    # Instantiate a new log handler
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler
    formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter()
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    # Get the root logger and add the handler to it
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    root_logger.addHandler(handler)
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

4. To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your [logs data in New Relic](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) using the query operator `has:span.id has:trace.id`.

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain `trace.id` and `span.id` fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

## What's next? [#what-next]

After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
