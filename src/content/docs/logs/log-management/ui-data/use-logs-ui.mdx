Use the Logs UI to:

* Spot interesting or significant patterns in your logs.
* Examine more context around a particular log line.
* Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules.
* Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc.
* Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions.
* Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent.

## Explore your log data [#ui-workflow]

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Logs**: Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav.
</figcaption>

To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow.

1. If you have not [customized your New Relic One navigation bar](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#custom-navigation), go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Browse data** and select **Logs**.
2. **Look for patterns:**

   * To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the [log patterns](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/find-unusual-logs-log-patterns-beta) icon on the left nav.
   * To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker.
3. **Narrow your focus:**

   * To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the `hostname` attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search.
   * To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our [built-in parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/built-log-parsing-rulesets/), or [create your own parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/parsing/) for attributes that match a particular value.
   * To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create [drop filter rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules/) that avoid collecting data you don't need.
4. **Examine log details:**

   Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON.

   * To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need.
   * To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the [**Show surrounding logs** <Icon name="fe-eye"/> icon](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/find-issues-cause-or-impact-surrounding-logs) for the attribute's details.
   * To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's `log_summary` column.
5. **Search:**

   By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, `process failed`.

   OR

   From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example:

   ```
   service_name equals <var>my service</var>
   ```

   For more information, see the [Logs query syntax documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/query-syntax-logs/).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create [data partition rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/).
</Callout>
   
6. **Get related logs:**

   For example:

   * To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable [live-tail logging](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/view-log-messages-real-time-live-tail).
   * To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's **Log details**.
   * To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the [**Show surrounding logs** <Icon name="fe-eye"/> icon](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/find-issues-cause-or-impact-surrounding-logs).
7. **Share your findings:**

   Use any of the [core New Relic One functions](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components) (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the [examples](#examples) in this document.

## Save your views [#saved-views]

You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view:

1. Click the **Saved Views** tab in the Logs UI left nav.
2. Click **Save current view**.
3. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the **Saved Views** tab.
4. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save.
5. Select the permission level: **Private**, **Public** **(Read-only)**, and **Public (Read and write)**. Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view.
6. Click **Save view**.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see [logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-logs).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="alert"
    title="Create an alert from log data"
  >
    You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Logs**.
    2. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, `service_name:"your service" "fatal error"`.
    3. In the search bar, click the plus icon, then select **Create an alert from this**.
    4. Complete the **Create alert condition** that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition.

    After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboard"
    title="Add log volume chart to a dashboard"
  >
    You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Logs**.
    2. Search for results you want to plot; for example, `service_name:"checkout service" "process failed"`.

       OR

       Select a saved view.
    3. Click the **dashboard** icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard.

    You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="troubleshoot-error"
    title="Troubleshoot an error (logs in context)"
  >
    To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see [logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-logs). Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app:

    1. Go to **APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics** and select an error trace.
    2. From the error trace **Details**, click **See logs**.
    3. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details.
    4. To identify the host generating the error, click **Show surrounding logs**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="troubleshoot-latency"
    title="Troubleshoot latency (logs in context)"
  >
    To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see [logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-logs). Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Distributed tracing**.
    2. Select a particularly slow trace.
    3. From the trace **Details**, click **See logs for this trace**.
    4. Browse related logs in the Logs UI.
  </Collapser>

## Links to logs in New Relic [#links]

Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI. For some of these options, you must be able to see [logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-logs).
