metaDescription: 'A list of all New Relic''s log parsing rulesets, which you can use to easily parse common log formats.'
---

New Relic can parse common log formats according to built-in rulesets, so that you don't have to create your own parsing rules. Here are the log parsing rulesets, their [Grok](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/patterns# "Link opens in a new window.") patterns, and what fields are parsed.

* To enable built-in log parsing, see our documentation for [adding the `logtype` attribute](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing#logtype).
* To manage your parsing rulesets programmatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL-format API, at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). For more information, see the NerdGraph tutorial **insert link to new doc**  to create, query, and delete your parsing rulesets.

  %{IPORHOST:clientip} %{USER:ident} %{USER:auth} \[%{HTTPDATE:timestamp}\] "(?:%{WORD:verb} %{NOTSPACE:request}(?: HTTP/%{NUMBER:httpversion})?|%{DATA:rawrequest})" %{NUMBER:response} (?:%{NUMBER:bytes}|-) %{QS:referrer} %{QS:agent}
  ```

  **Results:**

  * `clientip`: The IP address of the client.
  * `verb`: The HTTP verb
  * `ident`: The user identity of the client making the request
  * `response`: The HTTP status code of the response
  * `request`: The URI and request being made
  * `httpversion`: The HTTP version of the request
  * `rawrequest`: The raw HTTP request if data is posted
  * `bytes`: The number of bytes sent
  * `referrer`: The HTTP referrer
  * `agent`: The client's user agent

        The `structured.data` content is also parsed into separate attributes following a predefined naming convention: `sd.<sd-id>.<sd-param-name>`. For example, the structured data `[example one="1" two="2"]` would be parsed into two different attributes:

        ```
        sd.example.one: "1"
        sd.example.two: "2"
        ```

        If the same structured-data block contains duplicate param names it also appends an index-based suffix on the attribute name. For example, the structured data `[example number="1" number="2"]`would be parsed as:

        ```
        sd.example.number.0: "1"
        sd.example.number.1: "2"
        ```

        For structured data with enterprise numbers assigned, an extra attribute is also parsed. For example, the structured data `[example@123 number="1"]` would be parsed as:

        ```
        sd.example.enterprise.number: 123
        sd.example.number: "1"
        ```
