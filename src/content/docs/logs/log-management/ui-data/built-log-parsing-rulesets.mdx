metaDescription: 'A list of all New Relic''s log parsing rulesets, which you can use to easily parse common log formats.'
---

New Relic can parse common log formats according to built-in rulesets, so that you don't have to create your own parsing rules. Here are the log parsing rulesets, their [Grok](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/patterns# "Link opens in a new window.") patterns, and what fields are parsed.

* To enable built-in log parsing, see our documentation for [adding the `logtype` attribute](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing#logtype).
* To manage your parsing rulesets programmatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL-format API, at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). For more information, see the NerdGraph tutorial **insert link to new doc**  to create, query, and delete your parsing rulesets.

  **Results:**

  * `clientip`: The IP address of the client.
  * `verb`: The HTTP verb
  * `ident`: The user identity of the client making the request
  * `response`: The HTTP status code of the response
  * `request`: The URI and request being made
  * `httpversion`: The HTTP version of the request
  * `rawrequest`: The raw HTTP request if data is posted
  * `bytes`: The number of bytes sent
  * `referrer`: The HTTP referrer
  * `agent`: The client's user agent

          * `Miss`: The request could not be satisfied by an object in the edge cache, so CloudFront forwarded the request to the origin server and returned the result to the viewer.
          * `LimitExceeded`: The request was denied because a CloudFront limit was exceeded.
          * `CapacityExceeded`: CloudFront returned a `503` error because the edge location didn't have enough capacity at the time of the request to serve the object.
          * `Error`: Typically this means the request resulted in a client error (`sc_status` is `4xx`) or a server error (`sc_status` is `5xx`). If the value of `x_edge_result_type` is `Error` and the value of this field is not `Error`, the client disconnected before finishing the download.
          * `Redirect`: CloudFront redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. If `sc_status` is `403` and you configured CloudFront to restrict the geographic distribution of your content, the request might have come from a restricted location.

  **Results:**

  * `query`: The domain or subdomain that was specified in the request.
  * `query_type`: Either the DNS record type that was specified in the request, or `ANY`.
  * `response_code`: The DNS response code that Route 53 returned in response to the DNS query.
  * `protocol`: The protocol that was used to submit the query, either TCP or UDP.
  * `edge_location`: The Route 53 edge location that responded to the query. Each edge location is identified by a three-letter code and an arbitrary number; for example, `DFW3`. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.)
  * `resolver_ip`: The IP address of the DNS resolver that submitted the request to Route 53.
  * `edns_client_subnet`: A partial IP address for the client that the request originated from, if available from the DNS resolver.

  * `version`: Syslog protocol version.
  * `log.timestamp`: Original timestamp.
  * `hostname`: The machine that originally sent the Syslog message.
  * `app.name`: The device or application that originated the message.
  * `procid`: The process name or process ID associated with a Syslog system.
  * `msgid`: Identifies the type of message.
  * `structured.data`: Structured data string value.
  * `sd.<var>sd-id</var>.<var>sd-param-name</var>`: The `structured.data` content is also parsed into separate attributes following a predefined naming convention: `sd.<var>sd-id</var>.<var>sd-param-name</var>`. See the structured data parsing examples, which follow.
  * `message`: Free-form message that provides information about the event.

  **Structured data parsing examples:**
  
  The structured data `[example one="1" two="2"]` would be parsed into two different attributes:

  ```
  sd.example.one: "1"
  sd.example.two: "2"
  ```

  If the same structured data block contains duplicate param names, it also appends an index-based suffix on the attribute name. For example, the structured data `[example number="1" number="2"]`would be parsed as:

  ```
  sd.example.number.0: "1"
  sd.example.number.1: "2"
  ```

  For structured data with enterprise numbers assigned, an extra attribute is also parsed. For example, the structured data `[example@123 number="1"]` would be parsed as:

  ```
  sd.example.enterprise.number: 123
  sd.example.number: "1"
  ```
