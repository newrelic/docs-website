metaDescription: 'A list of all New Relic''s log parsing rulesets, which you can use to easily parse common log formats.'
---

New Relic can [parse common log formats](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing) according to built-in rulesets, so that you don't have to [create your own parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing#custom-parsing). Here we present each log parsing ruleset, their [Grok](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/patterns# "Link opens in a new window.") patterns, and what fields are parsed.

To enable built-in log parsing, see [How to add the `logtype` attribute](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/logs-parsing-built-rules-custom-parsing#logtype).

        * `Miss` – The request could not be satisfied by an object in the edge cache, so CloudFront forwarded the request to the origin server and returned the result to the viewer.
        * `LimitExceeded` – The request was denied because a CloudFront limit was exceeded.
        * `CapacityExceeded` – CloudFront returned a 503 error because the edge location didn't have enough capacity at the time of the request to serve the object.
        * `Error` – Typically, this means the request resulted in a client error (sc-status is 4xx) or a server error (sc-status is 5xx). If the value of x-edge-result-type is Error and the value of this field is not Error, the client disconnected before finishing the download.
        * `Redirect` – CloudFront redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. If sc-status is 403 and you configured CloudFront to restrict the geographic distribution of your content, the request might have come from a restricted location.

        The `structured.data` content is also parsed into separate attributes following a predefined naming convention: `sd.<sd-id>.<sd-param-name>`. For example, the structured data `[example one="1" two="2"]` would be parsed into two different attributes:

        ```
        sd.example.one: "1"
        sd.example.two: "2"
        ```

        If the same structured-data block contains duplicate param names it also appends an index-based suffix on the attribute name. For example, the structured data `[example number="1" number="2"]`would be parsed as:

        ```
        sd.example.number.0: "1"
        sd.example.number.1: "2"
        ```

        For structured data with enterprise numbers assigned, an extra attribute is also parsed. For example, the structured data `[example@123 number="1"]` would be parsed as:

        ```
        sd.example.enterprise.number: 123
        sd.example.number: "1"
        ```
