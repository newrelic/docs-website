New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data.

## Why New Relic for log management? [#what-is-logging]

As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential.

Log management provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single pane of glass.

## Log management features [#logs-definition]

Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools.

Log management's features include:

* Instantly search through your logs.
* Visualize your log data directly from the [Logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Use logging data to create custom [charts](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), and [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts).
* Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools.

## Bring in your logging data [#integrate-logs]

You can bring your log data into New Relic using a [compatible log forwarding plugin](/docs/enable-new-relic-logs#compatibility-requirements), or with [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-logs).

* Forward your logs [using our Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure-agent) or our [Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-plugin-logs).
* Use our plugins for well-known log forwarders, like [Fluentd](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/fluentd-plugin-logs), [Fluent Bit](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/fluent-bit-plugin-logs), and [Logstash](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/logstash-plugin-logs).
* Stream or ship your logs from Amazon using [AWS Lambda](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3) or [Kinesis](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/stream-logs-new-relic-using-kinesis-data-firehose).
* Send your logs data using the [Logs API](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs-api).

Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our [logs in context extensions](/docs/enable-logs-context-logs).


## View your logging data in New Relic [#find-data]

Logging data can be found in these locations:

* In our Logs UI:
  * [Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for US
  * [Logs UI](https://one.eu.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) for EU
* By querying the `Log` data type. For example, you can use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) to run:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

  For information on querying in general, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).
