As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place.

Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place.

## Find problems faster, reduce context switching [#logs-definition]

Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools.

Log management features include:

* Instantly search through your logs.
* Visualize your log data directly from the [Logs UI](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Use logging data to create custom [charts](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), and [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts).
* Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools.

## Bring in your logging data [#integrate-logs]

To bring your log data into New Relic, you can:

* Use our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) as a lightweight data collector, without having to install additional software.
* Select from a wide range of [log forwarding plugins](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/), including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more.
* Use our [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-concepts/#logs) solutions.
* Send your log data by using the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/) or [TCP endpoint](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic/).

Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our [logs in context extensions](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/).

## View your logging data in New Relic [#find-data]

You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API:

* Logs UI at [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)
* Logs UI for [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers/) if applicable: [one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com)

You can also query the `Log` data type. For example, use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) to run:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

You can also use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/), our GraphQL-format API, to request the exact data you need.

For more information, see our documentation about [query options](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) in New Relic.
