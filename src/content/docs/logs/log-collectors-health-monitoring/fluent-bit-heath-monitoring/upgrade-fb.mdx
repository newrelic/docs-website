  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>
You can upgrade your Fluent Bit agent within your Kubernetes clusters as follows:

Upgrade your Fluent Bit agent regularly to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches. You can learn directly from the New Relic UI [when a newer version becomes available](/docs/release-notes/fluentbit-release-notes).


<Steps>

<Step>
## Prerequisites to upgrade [#prerequisites]

* Ensure the Fluent Bit agent is part of a fleet. If it isn't, add the [agent to a fleet](/docs/new-relic-control/fleet-control/setup/).
* Take back up of your current configurations.
* Review the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/fluentbit-release-notes) for the latest version to understand new features, changes, and any potential impacts on your current setup.
</Step>

<Step>
## Check for available upgrades [#check-for-upgrades]

1. From <dnt>**Integrations & Agents**</dnt>, open the **Installed** tab.<br/>Youâ€™ll see the list of agents and integrations currently installed.
2. Use the <dnt>**Search entities**</dnt> field or the <dnt>**Type**</dnt> filter to narrow down the list to Fluent Bit agents.
3. Identify the agent that requires an upgrade.
