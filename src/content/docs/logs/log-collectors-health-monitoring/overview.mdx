<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

When you integrate New Relic with your infrastructure or applications through agent installation or cloud integration setup, You may choose to configure log collector for gathering and processing logs from all your environments. Imagine you encounter a situation where the logs in your environment are not arriving at New Relic at the usual rate. Your typical log flow might be around 150,000 logs per minute, but current observations suggest a noticeable drop. This could be due to various reasons, such as network issues, resource constraints, or issue with the log collector itself.

To address this situation, New Relic has the log collector health monitoring solution that provides insights into the health and performance of your log collector. currently we can monitor the health of the following log collectors:
* Fluent Bit collecting logs from Kubernetes clusters
* AWS log forwarder collecting logs from AWS services

This solution gathers and processes log collector health specific metrics and presents them in graphs and charts on the New Relic entity UI. DevOps teams, system administrators, and IT operations managers can leverage this solution to monitor the vital parameters of log collectors, diagnose issues, and refer the troubleshooting instructions in our documentation to resolve these issues.

## Health monitoring levels [#health-monitoring-levels]
New Relic provides two levels of health monitoring as following:
* **Essential monitoring:** Transmits only the vital metrics in a 10 minutes scrape interval necessary to ensure the log forwarder entity is operational. This option comes by default with the log collector configuration and focuses on the minimal data required for basic health checks.

* **Advanced monitoring:** Transmits a comprehensive set of metrics in a 1 minute scrape interval to provide a detailed overview of the log forwarder's performance and status. You can upgrade to this monitoring level by modifying the log collector configuration after the agent installation or cloud integration setup. This option is ideal for environments with high log volumes or where rapid response to issues is critical.

IF you do not want any health monitoring for your log collectors, you can opt out by modifying the log collector configuration after the agent installation or cloud integration setup.


### Pricing [#pricing]
The pricing for the log collector health monitoring solution is determined by the volume of data ingested, allowing you to assess the health and performance of your log collection infrastructure. Charges are applied on a per GB basis, as specified in your Order. The data ingestion volume is influenced by the number of log collector instances in your environment and the chosen monitoring level.
