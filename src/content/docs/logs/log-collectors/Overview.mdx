<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).

When you install the New Relic infrastructure agent on your Kubernetes clusters or other hosts, the configuration installs Fluent Bit as the default log collector. This log collector is responsible for gathering and processing logs from all your environments. Imagine you encounter a situation where the logs in your Kubernetes cluster or host are not arriving at New Relic at the usual rate. Your typical log flow might be around 150,000 logs per minute, but current observations suggest a noticeable drop. This could be due to various reasons, such as network issues, resource constraints, or issue with the log collector itself.

To address this situation, you need a log collector monitoring solution that provides insights into the health and performance of your log collection infrastructure. This is where the log collector lifecycle management solution in New Relic comes into play. This solution enables you to monitor and manage your log collection infrastructure across diverse environments, including Kubernetes clusters and on-premise hosts. It is designed to help you effectively manage the lifecycle of your log collectors in following ways:

- **Log collector health monitoring:** The Fluent Bit entity UI provides monitoring capabilities for log collectors. You can track key performance metrics to identify potential issues and facilitate troubleshooting.
- **Troubleshooting:** You can identify and diagnose issues with Fluent Bit, and refer the troubleshooting instructions in our documentation to resolve these problems.
- **Configuration and remote deployment:** With New Relic Control, you can centrally manage Fluent Bit configurations on Kubernetes clusters, update them, and deploy changes remotely.

DevOps teams, system administrators, and IT operations managers can leverage this solution to ensure that their log collection infrastructure is running optimally and providing the necessary visibility into the log data.

## Getting started [#getting-started-with-fb-monitoring]
The Fluent Bit entity UI is available by default to you with some essential health metrics from Fleunt Bit. This UI is automatically created when you install the New Relic infrastructure agent on your Kubernetes clusters or other hosts. To navigate to the Fluent Bit entity UI, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to [one.newrelic.com > All Entities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-entities) > <DNT>**Log Collectors**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Account**</DNT> drop-down, select the account you want to view.
3. Under the **Log Collectors** section, select <DNT>**Fluent Bit - Kubernetes**</DNT> or <DNT>**Fluent Bit - On-Hosts**</DNT>.
4. From the entities list, select the Fluent Bit agent you want to monitor.

While the Fluent Bit entity UI provides essential health metrics, it incures additional costs associated with the health metrics ingestion from the Fluent Bit agent. To avoid these costs, you can disable this solution by following these steps:

## Health monitoring levels [#health-monitoring-levels]
While New Relic provides an essential set of health metrics monitoring by default, you can upgrade your configuration to include additional metrics, that can provide deeper insights into the performance of your log collection infrastructure.
