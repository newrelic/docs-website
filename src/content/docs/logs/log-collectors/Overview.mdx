  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

When you install the New Relic Kubernetes integration on your Kubernetes clusters, You can choose to install log collector for gathering and processing logs from all your environments. It installs Fluent Bit as the default log collector. Imagine you encounter a situation where the logs in your Kubernetes cluster are not arriving at New Relic at the usual rate. Your typical log flow might be around 150,000 logs per minute, but current observations suggest a noticeable drop. This could be due to various reasons, such as network issues, resource constraints, or issue with the log collector itself.

To address this situation, you need a log collector monitoring solution that provides insights into the health and performance of your log collection infrastructure. Here the log collector health monitoring solution in New Relic comes into play. This solution enables you to monitor and manage your log collection infrastructure in your Kubernetes clusters. It is designed to help you monitor the health of your log collectors and you can manage the lifecycle of your log collectors in the following ways:

- **[Log collector health monitoring](/docs/logs/log-collectors/monitor-health-of-log-collector):** The Fluent Bit entity UI provides monitoring capabilities for log collectors. You can track key performance metrics to identify potential issues and facilitate troubleshooting.
- **[Troubleshooting](/docs/logs/log-collectors/troubleshooting):** You can identify and diagnose issues with Fluent Bit, and refer the troubleshooting instructions in our documentation to resolve these problems.
- **[Configuration and remote deployment](/docs/logs/log-collectors/manage-log-collector-lifecycle-for-k8-clusters):** With New Relic Control, you can centrally manage Fluent Bit configurations on Kubernetes clusters, update them, and deploy changes remotely.

DevOps teams, system administrators, and IT operations managers can leverage this solution to ensure that their log collection infrastructure is running optimally and providing the necessary visibility into the log data.

## Health monitoring levels [#health-monitoring-levels]
The log collector monitoring solution in New Relic provides three levels of health monitoring as following:
- **Essential monitoring:** This is the default level of monitoring, that transmits only the vital metrics in a 10 minutes scrape interval necessary to ensure the log forwarder entity is operational. This option focuses on the minimal data required for basic health checks.
- **Balanced monitoring:** Transmits a comprehensive set of metrics in a 5 minutes scrape interval to provide an overview of the log forwarder's performance and status.
- **Advanced monitoring:** Transmits a comprehensive set of metrics in a 1 minute scrape interval to provide a detailed overview of the log forwarder's performance and status. This option is ideal for environments with high log volumes or where rapid response to issues is critical.

You can also choose not to monitor health of your log collectors, by opting out for it during the installation of the New Relic Kubernetes integration, or by disabling it later.

### Pricing [#pricing]
The pricing for the log collector monitoring solution is determined by the volume of data ingested, allowing you to assess the health and performance of your log collection infrastructure. Charges are applied on a per GB basis, as specified in your Order. The data ingestion volume is influenced by the number of Fluent Bit instances in your environment and the chosen monitoring level. An increase in instances or a higher monitoring level results in greater data ingestion. Below is a monthly estimate of data ingested from a single Fluent Bit instance for each monitoring level:

- **Essential monitoring:** 0.003 GB
- **Balanced monitoring:** 0.2 GB
- **Advanced monitoring:** 1 GB
