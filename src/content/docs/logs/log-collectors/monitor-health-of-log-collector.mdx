Effective performance monitoring of the Fluent Bit agent is crucial for log management and optimization within your Kubernetes environments. By tracking key metrics, you can identify potential issues and facilitate troubleshooting. You can access the Fluent Bit entity UI in the following ways:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="via-integration-and-agents" title="Via Integrations & Agents">
 1. Open the **Installed** tab. You’ll see the list of agents and integrations currently installed.
 2. Use the <dnt>**Search entities**</dnt> field or the <dnt>**Type**</dnt> filter to narrow down the list to Fluent Bit agents.
 3. Select the agent that you want to check.
</Collapser>
<Collapser id="via-all-entities" title="Via All Entities">
 1. Under the **Fluent Bit - Kubernetes** group, find the agent that you want to monitor.
 2. Select the agent.
</Collapser>
<Collapser id="via-fleet" title="Via Fleet">
 1. In <dnt>**New Relic Control**</dnt>, open **Fleets**.
 2. Identify and select the fleet that has the Fluent Bit instrumentation.
 3. On the Agents tab, select the Fluent Bit agent.

## Key performance metrics to track [#key-performance-metrics]
Essential monitoring is the default level of monitoring provided by New Relic. You can [upgrade](/docs/logs/log-collectors/manage-log-collector-lifecycle-for-k8-clusters/#upgrade-fluent-bit-health-monitoring-level) to Balanced or Advanced monitoring to access additional metrics that provide deeper insights into the performance of your log collection infrastructure. Depending on your monitoring type selection, you can track the following key performance metrics:

- **Log throughput rate:** Measures the efficiency of log flow and highlights any disruptions. It includes an overall throughput assessment, which is further broken down by input and output plugins to show the flow of records and bytes processed.
- **Memory buffer utilization:** Helps identify resource constraints affecting log processing. It includes buffer usage, instances of overflows, queue length, and overall process and container memory utilization.
- **Container events and crash loop backoffs:** Alerts to abnormal conditions or failures in log pods, including errors, dropped records, and retries. These insights help in identifying and addressing issues that may disrupt log processing.

You can monitor the health and performance of your Fluent Bit agent on the Fluent Bit entity dashboard. Here’s how you can access it:

## Example Use case: Log flow efficiency
Imagine that the logs in your Kubernetes cluster are not arriving at New Relic at the usual rate. Your typical log flow might be around 150,000 logs per minute, but current observations suggest a noticeable drop. Here’s how you can address this situation, leveraging New Relic Control and Fluent Bit monitoring tools to diagnose and resolve the issue.

### Step 1: Monitor log throughput
Begin by checking the rate at which logs are forwarded. Discrepancies can indicate disruptions in the log forwarding process.

### Step 2: Analyze container metrics and events
Access the Kubernetes overview to identify any abnormal events or restarts in the logging pods. Frequent restarts or warning events, such as crash loop backoffs, can disrupt your log pipeline and indicate underlying issues.

### Step 3: Check memory usage
Examine the memory consumption of your Fluent Bit agents. High or erratic memory usage can signal configuration errors or resource limitations that need addressing.

### Step 4: Utilize Fleet Control for troubleshooting
Use Fleet Control to review recent configuration changes. Identifying and rectifying any erroneous settings, such as incorrect memory limits, can resolve bottlenecks and improve log throughput.

### Step 5: Redeploy and verify
After making necessary configuration adjustments in Fleet Control, initiate a new deployment to apply changes.
Use the Fluent Bit entity view to monitor real-time metrics and observe the impact of the new configurations. Look for recovery in log throughput and stability in memory usage, indicating that the issues have been resolved.

### Upgrade your Fluent Bit agent
Upgrade your Fluent Bit agent regularly to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches. You can learn directly from the New Relic UI [when a newer version becomes available](/docs/release-notes/fluentbit-release-notes).

Before upgrading, ensure your current configurations are backed up. Review any release notes or documentation to understand new features or changes.
