  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

You can use the log collector lifecycle management solution for hosts in the following ways. 

- Gather and process logs from all your containerized applications.
- Append host-related metadata to your logs.
- Use Fluent Bit's lightweight design to process large volumes of data without consuming a lot of resources.

Fluent bit log collector is the default log collector for New Relic. With infrastructure agent installation, Fluent Bit is installed in your host environment. If it is disabled in your host and you want to enable it, or if you want to set up a new Fluent Bit agent, High level steps with links to detailed instructions:

 High level steps with links to detailed instructions:
### Prerequisites [#prerequisites]
  Before you install and configure Fluent Bit for logging with New Relic, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
  - Access to the host environment
  - The necessary tools and permissions for installation and configuration
  - Network settings and security policies to allow communication with New Relic endpoints
  - A New Relic account

  For more information on these requirements, refer to [Forward your logs to New Relic](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic).<br/>

## Configuration in Kubernetes environment [#configuration-in-kubernetes-environment]

After you set up your Fluent Bit agent, you will start receiving logs in New Relic, and simultaneously, you can [monitor the health and performance of your log collector](/docs/logs/log-collectors/monitor-health-of-log-collector) from the Fluent Bit entity UI. While observing the health and performance metrics, if you want to modify the configuration for troubleshooting, or upgrade your [Fluent Bit health monitoring level](/docs/logs/log-collectors/Overview/#health-monitoring-levels), perform the following steps:
