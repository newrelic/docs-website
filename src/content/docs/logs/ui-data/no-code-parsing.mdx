metaDescription: Create parsing rules visually without writing Grok or Regex patterns. No-Code Parsing lets you build log transformation rules through an intuitive visual interface.
freshnessValidatedDate: 2026-02-25
---

No-Code Parsing is an intuitive visual interface to create log parsing rules without needing Grok or Regex patterns. It's designed for anyone who needs to extract meaningful data from logs without requiring specialized knowledge of pattern matching languages.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you prefer writing Grok or Regex patterns directly, you can switch to the [code-based parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing) experience. When creating or editing a parsing rule, look for the toggle option to revert to the old experience.
</Callout>

## No-Code Parsing vs. code-based parsing [#comparison]

| Feature | Code-based parsing | No-Code Parsing |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Interface | Text-based Grok/Regex editor | Visual editor with automatic pattern detection |
| Pattern creation | Write Grok patterns or regex manually | Click and configure detected patterns |
| Learning curve | Requires understanding of Grok/Regex | No pattern syntax knowledge needed |
| Pattern detection | Manual pattern writing | Automatic detection of common patterns (timestamps, IPs, UUIDs, key-value pairs) |
| Preview | Output preview available | Real-time preview with sample logs |
| Advanced customization | Full control over pattern syntax | Can switch to code editor for complex cases |
| Best for | Complex patterns, advanced users, custom requirements | Quick setup, common log formats, users without Grok/Regex experience |
## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* **Permissions:** You must have the required permissions to create parsing rules in New Relic.
* **Log data:** Logs must be ingested into your New Relic account to create parsing rules.

      </td>

      <td>
        * Parsing is applied to a specific selected field. By default, the `message` field is used, but you can choose any field or attribute from your logs.
        * Each parsing rule uses matching criteria to determine which logs the rule will attempt to parse. You can define this by creating a NRQL filter or by pasting a sample log.
        * No-Code Parsing automatically detects common patterns in your log samples: timestamps (ISO 8601, Unix epoch, Apache common log format), IP addresses, MAC addresses, UUIDs, log levels (ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, WARN), hostnames, domain names, and key-value pairs.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        When
      </td>

      <td>
        * Parsing is applied once to each log message during ingestion, before data is written to NRDB.
        * If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds is applied.
        * Parsing occurs before data enrichments take place, so matching criteria must be based on attributes that exist in the raw log data.

        How
      </td>

      <td>
        * The visual editor automatically highlights detected patterns in your log samples and displays them in the <DNT>**Patterns we detected**</DNT> section.
        * You can accept auto-detected patterns, manually select additional text to parse, or switch to traditional Grok/Regex syntax for advanced use cases.
        * The <DNT>**Preview output**</DNT> panel shows real-time results against up to 10 sample logs, displaying which logs match your rule and what attributes will be extracted.
        * Behind the scenes, No-Code Parsing generates standard Grok patterns that you can view and modify in the <DNT>**Rule code**</DNT> section.

## Create a parsing rule [#create-parsing-rule]

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select an entry point

No-Code Parsing provides multiple entry points to create parsing rules, allowing you to start from different contexts within the platform.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="parsing-view"
    title="Create a rule from the Parsing view"
  >
    To create a parsing rule from the main Parsing interface:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Logs > Parsing**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Create parsing rule**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a rule name and under <DNT>**Find the logs you want to parse**</DNT>, choose <DNT>**Create a filter**</DNT> to add a NRQL filter or click <DNT>**Paste a sample log**</DNT> and paste a sample log directly.
    3. If you're using a filter, click <DNT>**Run your query**</DNT>.
    4. Under <DNT>**Select the field you'll use to parse**</DNT>, click the field you want to parse.
    5. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="log-context"
    title="Create a rule from a log in context"
  >
    To create a parsing rule directly from a specific log entry:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Logs**</DNT> and click a log to open its <DNT>**Log details**</DNT>.
    2. Click on the field you want to parse and select <DNT>**Create ingest time parsing rule**</DNT>.
    3. The field and filter are pre-populated based on your context.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
</Step>

<Step>
### Review detected patterns

The <DNT>**Patterns we detected**</DNT> section shows highlighted patterns that New Relic automatically identified in your logs.

1. Click any highlighted pattern to view and configure its settings. The configuration options vary based on the <DNT>**Data format**</DNT> you select.
2. After configuring, click <DNT>**Update**</DNT> to apply changes or <DNT>**Remove**</DNT> to delete the pattern.

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Additional options:** Click and drag to highlight text in the <DNT>**message data**</DNT> to manually add patterns that aren't auto-detected. A menu appears with the following options: <DNT>**Auto-detect patterns**</DNT>, <DNT>**Select text to parse**</DNT>, and <DNT>**Remove selected patterns**</DNT>.

  When naming attributes, use lowercase with underscores (for example, `user_id`, `request_time`). Avoid special characters except underscores, and don't start names with numbers. Choose descriptive names that indicate the data's purpose.

  For advanced users, view the <DNT>**Rule code**</DNT> section to see the Grok pattern being generated, and click <DNT>**Write your own rule**</DNT> to edit the pattern directly.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Preview the results

Review the <DNT>**Preview output**</DNT> panel to verify your parsing rule works correctly:

* Check that sample logs show a green checkmark, indicating they match your rule.
* Expand samples to view the extracted attributes and confirm they're captured as expected.

**Logs that don't parse:**

If a sample log doesn't show a green checkmark or isn't parsing as expected:

1. Expand the log and click <DNT>**Use as sample**</DNT> button.
2. The editor switches to that log and re-runs pattern detection.
3. Update your patterns to handle this log format.
4. Review all samples again to ensure the updated rule works across variations.
</Step>

<Step>
### Save your rule

Once you're satisfied with your parsing rule, click:

* <DNT>**Save rule:**</DNT> Activates the rule immediately. It applies to all logs ingested after this moment.
* <DNT>**Save as draft:**</DNT> Saves your rule configuration without activating it. You can activate it later from the <DNT>**Parsing**</DNT> view.

Your rule only processes logs ingested after activation. It doesn't retroactively parse existing logs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Pattern detection capabilities [#pattern-detection]

No-Code Parsing's intelligent auto-detection recognizes common patterns:

| Pattern | Examples | Configuration Options |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Timestamps** | `2026-01-29T14:32:15Z`, `1738166335`, `29/Jan/2026:14:32:15 +0000` | Format auto-detected |
| **IP addresses** | `192.168.1.100`, `2001:db8::1` | IPv4 and IPv6 |
| **MAC addresses** | `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`, `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E` | Multiple format support |
| **UUIDs** | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` | Standard UUID format |
| **Log levels** | `ERROR`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `FATAL` | Case-insensitive |
| **Hostnames** | `app-server-01`, `api.example.com` | Domain names included |
| **Key-value pairs** | `user=john id=123 status=active` | Configurable delimiter and separator |

## Manage parsing rules [#manage-rules]

After creating parsing rules, you can manage them from <DNT>**Logs > Parsing**</DNT>. Draft rules are saved but not yet activated. You can activate them when you're ready to apply them to incoming logs.

### Edit a parsing rule

1. In your parsing rules list, click the rule name or click <DNT>**... > Edit**</DNT> and make the required changes.
2. Click <DNT>**Save rule**</DNT> (or <DNT>**Save as draft**</DNT> if you want to keep it disabled).

Changes apply to logs ingested after the update.

### Enable, disable, or delete a parsing rule

1. Find the rule in your parsing rules list and click <DNT>**...**</DNT> menu.
2. Choose an action:
   * <DNT>**Enable:**</DNT> Activates the draft rule (applies to newly ingested logs immediately)
   * <DNT>**Disable:**</DNT> Temporarily pauses the active rule
   * <DNT>**Delete:**</DNT> Removes the rule completely
