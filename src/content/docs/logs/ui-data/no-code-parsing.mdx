<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

No-Code Parsing is an intuitive visual interface to create log parsing rules without needing Grok or Regex patterns. It's designed for anyone who needs to extract meaningful data from logs without requiring specialized knowledge of pattern matching languages.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before using No-Code Parsing, ensure you have:

* **Feature access:** You need to enable the preview feature.
* **Permissions:** You must have permissions to create parsing rules in New Relic.
* **Log data:** Logs must be ingested into New Relic for you to create parsing rules.

## How to access No-Code Parsing [#access]

1. In New Relic, click your username in the bottom left.
2. Select <DNT>**Administration > Previews & Trials**</DNT>.
3. Enable the No-Code Parsing preview.

## How No-Code Parsing works [#how-it-works]

        What
      </td>

      <td>
        * Parsing is applied to a specific selected field. By default, the `message` field is used, but you can choose any field or attribute from your logs.
        * Each parsing rule uses matching criteria to determine which logs the rule will attempt to parse. You can define this by creating a NRQL filter or by pasting a sample log.
        * No-Code Parsing automatically detects common patterns in your log samples: timestamps (ISO 8601, Unix epoch, Apache common log format), IP addresses, MAC addresses, UUIDs, log levels (ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, WARN), hostnames, domain names, and key-value pairs.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        When
      </td>

      <td>
        * Parsing is applied once to each log message during ingestion, before data is written to NRDB.
        * If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds is applied.
        * Parsing occurs before data enrichments take place, so matching criteria must be based on attributes that exist in the raw log data.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        How
      </td>

      <td>
        * The visual editor automatically highlights detected patterns in your log samples and displays them in the <DNT>**Patterns we detected**</DNT> section.
        * You can accept auto-detected patterns, manually select additional text to parse, or switch to traditional Grok/Regex syntax for advanced use cases.
        * The <DNT>**Preview output**</DNT> panel shows real-time results against up to 10 sample logs, displaying which logs match your rule and what attributes will be extracted.
        * Behind the scenes, No-Code Parsing generates standard Grok patterns that you can view and modify in the <DNT>**Rule code**</DNT> section.

## Parsing rule creation [#create-parsing-rule]

You can start creating a parsing rule from two locations:

**From the <DNT>**Parsing**</DNT> view:**
1. Go to <DNT>**Logs > Parsing**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Create parsing rule**</DNT>.
2. Enter a rule name in <DNT>**Name your rule**</DNT>.
3. Under <DNT>**Find the logs you want to parse**</DNT>, choose <DNT>**Create a filter**</DNT> to add a NRQL filter (for example, `app = 'log-parser-consumer'`) or click <DNT>**Paste a sample log**</DNT> and paste a sample log directly.
4. Click <DNT>**Run your query**</DNT> (if using a filter).
5. Under <DNT>**Select the field you'll use to parse**</DNT>, click the field you want to parse.
6. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.

**From a log in context:**
1. Go to <DNT>**Logs**</DNT> and click a log to open its <DNT>**Log details**</DNT>.
2. Click on the field you want to parse and select <DNT>**Create ingest time parsing rule**</DNT>.
3. The field and filter are pre-populated based on your context.

### Attribute naming conventions

When creating attributes through No-Code Parsing, follow these guidelines for consistency:

* Use lowercase with underscores for multi-word attributes: `response_code`, `user_id`, `request_duration_ms`.
* Use only `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_` — no special characters.
* Be descriptive: `user_id` is better than `uid`.
* Include units where relevant: `duration_ms`, `size_bytes`.
* Avoid reserved field names; use `custom_` prefix if needed.

Consistent naming makes queries and analysis easier across your team.

### Creating your parsing rule

Once you've selected a field to parse, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Review detected patterns

After selecting your field and clicking <DNT>**Next**</DNT>, the editor displays the sample logs matching your criteria. The <DNT>**Patterns we detected**</DNT> section shows highlighted patterns that New Relic automatically identified in your logs.

Click any highlighted pattern to configure it:

**Pattern settings:**
* <DNT>**Pattern:**</DNT> The pattern type (for example, Greedy Data, Timestamp, IP Address)
* <DNT>**Ignore selected string:**</DNT> Choose whether to extract or ignore the highlighted text
* <DNT>**Data format:**</DNT> Select how to parse the data
* <DNT>**Prefix:**</DNT> Add a prefix to extracted attributes (for example, `kvpdata.generationId` uses prefix `kvpdata`)
* <DNT>**Include prefix:**</DNT> Toggle whether to include the prefix in attribute names

**For key-value pairs, configure:**
* <DNT>**Delimiter:**</DNT> Character separating pairs (default: comma `,`, also supports space, semicolon, etc.)
* <DNT>**Key-value separator:**</DNT> Character between keys and values (default: `=`, also supports `:`, `-`, etc.)
* <DNT>**Advanced configurations:**</DNT> Escape character (default: `\`), quote character (default: `'`), trim keys/values, drop original value

After configuring, click <DNT>**Update**</DNT> to apply changes or <DNT>**Remove**</DNT> to delete the pattern.

**Manual selection:** To highlight additional fields not auto-detected, select text in the <DNT>**message data**</DNT>. The editor suggests a pattern you can add to your rule.

**Start fresh:** Click <DNT>**Remove selected patterns**</DNT> to clear all auto-detected patterns and manually select fields.

The <DNT>**Rule code**</DNT> section shows the Grok pattern being generated. For advanced users, click <DNT>**Write your own rule**</DNT> to edit the pattern directly.
</Step>

<Step>
### Preview the results

The <DNT>**Preview output**</DNT> panel on the right shows <DNT>**Sample matches**</DNT>. Each sample displays:

* A green checkmark for logs that match your rule
* <DNT>**Selected sample**</DNT> label for the log you're currently working with
* Collapsible view showing extracted attributes

Click a sample to expand it and see:
* The original field value
* Extracted attributes as separate fields

**Logs that don't parse:**

If a sample log doesn't show a green checkmark or isn't parsing as expected:

1. Expand the log and click <DNT>**Use as sample**</DNT> button.
2. The editor switches to that log and re-runs pattern detection.
3. Update your patterns to handle this log format.
4. Review all samples again to ensure the updated rule works across variations.
</Step>

<Step>
### Save your rule

Once you're satisfied with your parsing rule, you have several options at the bottom of the editor:

* <DNT>**Save rule:**</DNT> Activates the rule immediately. It applies to all logs ingested after this moment.
* <DNT>**Save as draft:**</DNT> Saves your rule configuration without activating it. You can activate it later from the <DNT>**Parsing**</DNT> view.

Your rule only processes logs ingested after activation. It doesn't retroactively parse existing logs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Pattern detection capabilities [#pattern-detection]

No-Code Parsing's intelligent auto-detection recognizes common patterns:

| Pattern | Examples | Configuration Options |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Timestamps** | `2026-01-29T14:32:15Z`, `1738166335`, `29/Jan/2026:14:32:15 +0000` | Format auto-detected |
| **IP addresses** | `192.168.1.100`, `2001:db8::1` | IPv4 and IPv6 |
| **MAC addresses** | `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`, `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E` | Multiple format support |
| **UUIDs** | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` | Standard UUID format |
| **Log levels** | `ERROR`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `FATAL` | Case-insensitive |
| **Hostnames** | `app-server-01`, `api.example.com` | Domain names included |
| **Key-value pairs** | `user=john id=123 status=active` | Configurable delimiter and separator |

## Manage parsing rules [#manage-rules]

After creating parsing rules, you can manage them from <DNT>**Logs > Parsing**</DNT>. Draft rules are saved but not yet activated. You can activate them when you're ready to apply them to incoming logs.

### Edit a parsing rule

1. Find the rule in your parsing rules list.
2. Click the rule name.
3. Make changes in the No-Code Parsing editor.
4. Click <DNT>**Save rule**</DNT> (or <DNT>**Save as draft**</DNT> if you want to keep it inactive).

Changes apply to logs ingested after the update.

### Enable a draft rule

1. Find the draft rule in your parsing rules list.
2. Click the <DNT>**...**</DNT> menu.
3. Choose <DNT>**Enable**</DNT>.

The rule becomes active immediately and applies to newly ingested logs.

### Disable or delete a parsing rule

1. Find the rule in your parsing rules list.
2. Click the <DNT>**...**</DNT> menu.
3. Choose <DNT>**Disable**</DNT> to temporarily pause the rule or <DNT>**Delete**</DNT> to remove it completely.
