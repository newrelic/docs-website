After log event data has been sent to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). To drop log data, you can use the logs management UI, as explained in this document. You can also use [NerdGraph to drop data](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/drop-data-using-nerdgraph). NerdGraph is our GraphQL Explorer.

## Savings, security, speed [#why-it-matters]

Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals:

* Lower costs by storing only the logs relevant to your account.
* Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII).
* Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the [responsibilities and considerations for dropping data](#caution).
</Callout>

## How drop filter rules work [#how-it-works]

A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to the New Relic database (NRDB).

This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored.

## Cautions when dropping data [#caution]

When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic.

New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are.

Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create.

## Create drop filter rules [#create]

For permissions-related requirements, see [Drop data requirements](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph#requirements).

Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule.

  Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from **Manage data** on the left nav of the logs UI, click **Create drop filter**.
</figcaption>

To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing [log queries](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/query-syntax-logs).
There are three different ways you can create a drop filter:

**From a query:**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped.
3. Once the query is active, from **Manage data** on the left nav of the logs UI, click **Create drop filter**.
4. Give the drop rule a meaningful name.
5. The NRQL field will be prepopulated by the query entered into the search bar. If the query still needs adjustments feel free to edit it here.
6. Choose to either [drop the entire log event](#drop-events) that matches the query or just a [specific subset of attributes](#drop-attributes) in the matching events.
7. Save the drop filter rule.

**From an attribute:**
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. In **All logs** click on a log that contains the attribute you want to drop to open log detail view.
3. Click on the attribute you want to drop to open the attribute menu.
4. Click **Create drop filter from attribute**.
5. Give the drop rule a meaningful name.
6. The NRQL field will be prepopulated by with the attribute’s key and value. If the query still needs adjustments feel free to edit it here.
7. Choose to either [drop the entire log event](#drop-events) that matches the query or just a [specific subset of attributes](#drop-attributes) in the matching events.
8. Save the drop filter rule.

**From scratch:**
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. From **Manage data** on the left nav of the logs UI, click **Drop filters**.
3. Click the **Create drop filter** button on the right hand side of the drop filters view.
4. Give the drop rule a meaningful name.
5. Fill out the NRQL field to filter logs that contain the data you would like to be dropped.
6. Choose to either [drop the entire log event](#drop-events) that matches the query or just a [specific subset of attributes](#drop-attributes) in the matching events.
7. Save the drop filter rule.

## Manage drop filter rules via NerdGraph API [#nerdgraph]

To manage your drop filter rules programmatically, you can use [NerdGraph](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/drop-data-using-nerdgraph), our GraphQL Explorer, to create, query, and delete your drop filter rules.

## Types of drop filter rules [#types]

The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes.

### Drop log events [#drop-events]

The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped.

Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data.

### Drop attributes [#drop-attributes]

You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB.

<Callout variant="tip">
  We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data.
</Callout>

## View or delete drop filter rules [#drop-rules-delete]

After you delete a drop filter rule from here, the ingested log events are no longer filtered.

To view or delete a drop filter rule:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. From **Manage data** on the left nav of the logs UI, click **Drop filters**.
