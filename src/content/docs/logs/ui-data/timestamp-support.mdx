A log event leaves behind a timestamp attribute, which tells you the exact moment a certain event happened. Timestamps are critical for ordering events as they let you search logs for specific timeframes, letting you discover what and when an event happened.

Timestamps have many formats without a single standard. They appear at the beginning of the log event in most cases, but can sometimes appear much later in the log, or not at all.

* By default, New Relic assigns the value of the log `timestamp` attribute (a reserved keyword) at the exact time the log is ingested. This is referred to as the ingest time.
* When logs don't have a `timestamp` attribute, New Relic assigns a timestamp at time of ingest.
* Logs in a JSON format contain some attribute that identifies the timestamp, like `timestamp`, `log_timestamp`, `time`, etc.
* If we receive JSON logs with with a supported timestamp format, we override our ingest timestamp with the JSON attribute.

## Supported logs timestamp format [#format]

There are two options for manually overriding default behavior to assign the `timestamp` value contained in the log.

1. If we receive a [JSON formatted log](#timestamps_in_json_logs) containing a `timestamp` attribute in one of our supported time formats, the ingest timestamp will be overridden. Instead, the the timestamp value from the JSON attribute will be used.
2. You can use [parsing rules](#timestamp_parsing_rules) to override the ingest `timestamp` value.  Parsing rules let you extract out data to format your timestamp with one of our supported formats. You can also use `datetime` Grok type and a `pattern` to define the custom timestamp format in your log.

We support two timestamp formats:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="unix"
    title="Unix epoch timestamp format"
  >
    A unix <DNT>**epoch**</DNT> timestamp is based on the number of seconds (or milliseconds) that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. Two example formats for `Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:06:32 GMT` would be:

    * 10-digit epoch seconds time: `1699027592`
    * 13-digit epoch milliseconds time: `1699027592000`
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ISO8601"
    title="ISO8601 timestamp format"
  >
    The ISO8601 format follows the `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSTZD` pattern (e.g. 2023-11-07T14:20:35+04:00). For example:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <DNT>
              **Key**
            </DNT>
          </th>

          <th>
            <DNT>
              **Value**
            </DNT>
          </th>

          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            <DNT>
              **Example**
            </DNT>
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            yyyy-MM-dd
          </td>

          <td>
            * Four digit year
            * Two digit month (01 for January, 02 for February, etc.)
            * Two digit day (01 to 31)
          </td>

          <td>
            2023-11-03
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            THH:mm:ss.SSS
          </td>

          <td>
            * `T` indicates start of the time element
            * Two digit hour (00 through  23)
            * Two digit minute (00 through 59)
            * Two digit second (00 through 59)
            * Three digit milliseconds (optional, up to nine digits with only the first three shown)
          </td>

          <td>
            T14:20:35
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            TZD (timezone designator)
          </td>

          <td>
            The `+` or `-` indicates how far ahead or behind a timezone is from UTC (Coordinated Universal Timie). UTC is assumed if not provided.
          </td>

          <td>
            \+04:00
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    Here are some format examples for ISO8601:

    * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`: 2023-11-03T15:28:05
    * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS`: 2023-11-03T15:28:05.250
    * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`: 2023-11-03T15:28:05Z
    * `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss+HH:mm`: 2023-11-03T15:28:05+07:00

    The maximum precision for timestamps is milliseconds. Timestamps expressed more precisely (e.g. nanoseconds or microseconds) automatically shorten to milliseconds.

## Supported timestamps in JSON logs [#timestamps-json]

If we receive a JSON formatted log with a `timestamp` attribute, we override the default ingest `timestamp` value with the original JSON value. If there's no timestamp field, or the field is incorrectly formatted, the log will be stored with the ingest timestamp. Keep in mind that a payload with timestamps older than 48 hours are dropped.

Timestamps are converted to Unix epoch milliseconds and stored internally as a long data type, with the reserved keyword `timestamp`. Depending on the JSON body format, ​the timestamp field can be allocated in four different places:

* Inside the [simplified set of attributes](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#simple-json) of the JSON body message when sending a single JSON object.
* Inside the [common](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#json-common) object in the detailed set of attributes of the JSON body message when sending one or more JSON objects. The timestamp applies to all log messages of this JSON.
* Inside each log message in the [logs](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#json-logs) object in the detailed set of attributes of the JSON body message when sending one or more JSON objects. The timestamps only apply to that log message.
* Inside the “message” JSON field when it is a valid JSON message. Our <InlinePopover type="logs"/> capabilities will parse any message attribute as JSON. The resulting JSON attributes in the parsed message will be added to the log.

Here are some examples of JSON logs with a valid `timestamp` attribute that override the ingest `timestamp`:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="json-epoch"
    title="JSON log in epoch format (no ms precision)"
  >
    If we receive a JSON log like this with `timestamp` in <DNT>**epoch**</DNT> format (with no ms precision):

    ```json
    { 
      "timestamp":1701445572,
      "message":"This is my sample JSON log message with timestamp attribute in epoch format"
    }
    ```

    We will override the ingest `timestamp` with the epoch `timestamp` contained in the log, and the result will look like this:

    ```json
    "timestamp" : 1701445572000,
    "message":"This is my sample JSON log message with timestamp attribute in epoch format"
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="json-ISO8601"
    title="JSON log in ISO8601 format"
  >
    If we receive a JSON log like this with timestamp in <DNT>**ISO8601**</DNT> format like this:

    ```json
    {
      "timestamp":"2023-12-01T15:46:26.607Z",
      "message":"This is my sample JSON log message with timestamp attribute in ISO8601 format"
    }
    ```

    We will override the ingest `timestamp` with the ISO8601 `timestamp` (converted to epoch) contained in the log, and the result will look like this:

    ```json
    "timestamp": 1701445586607,
    "message":"This is my sample JSON log message with timestamp attribute in ISO8601 format"
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Set log timestamp with parsing rules [#timestamp-parsing-rules]

You can use parsing rules at ingest to override the ingest `timestamp` with the value contained in the log. Parsing rules extract out our supported time formats with simple Grok expressions, or by using the `datetime` Grok type and `pattern` to define the custom timestamp format in your log.

The attribute name extracted by the expression must be `timestamp` and its data type must be string or long. If data type is not provided, the timestamp defaults to string. For epoch timestamps with microsecond or nanosecond precision, you must include the `long` datatype even though timestamp precision shortens to milliseconds.

If the timestamp in your log is a Unix epoch or ISO8601 formatted timestamp you can use the default Grok patterns to match them. For example:

* To extract a Unix epoch timestamp you can use any expression that matches the value, like `NUMBER`, `NOTSPACE`, `DATA`, or `GREEDYDATA`.
* To extract an ISO8601 formatted timestamp you should use the `TIMESTAMP_ISO8601` Grok expression.

You can use the `datetime` Grok type to parse timestamps in non-supported formats. To do this you must include the `datetime` Grok type with the `pattern` matching your logs timestamp format. The `pattern` must use the Java Simple Date and Time Patterns found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). Below are examples that show how Grok expressions transform unsupported timestamp formats into supported formats:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        `timestamp`
      </th>

      <th>
        `pattern`
      </th>

      <th>
        Grok expression
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>

      <td>
        MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS
      </td>

      <td>
        `%{DATA:timestamp:datetime;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS}`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>

      <td>
        MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss
      </td>

      <td>
        `%{DATA:timestamp:datetime;MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss}`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        11/17/2023 09:55:25 AM
      </td>

      <td>
        MM/dd/yyyy h:mm:ss a
      </td>

      <td>
        `%{DATA:timestamp:datetime;MM/dd/yyyy h:mm:ss a}`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Below are some examples on how to parse the `timestamp` from your logs using ingest Parsing rules:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="parse-ISO8601"
    title="Parse rule for timestamps in ISO8601 format"
  >
    Add this parsing rule:

    ```
    %{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}
    ```

    To this log message with timestamp in <DNT>**ISO8601**</DNT> format:

    ```
    2023-12-05T16:50:48.421Z 146.190.212.184: This is my sample non-JSON log message with ISO8601 timestamp.
    ```

    To parse your log as follows:

    ```json
