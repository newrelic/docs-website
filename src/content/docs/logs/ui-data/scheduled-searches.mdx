As a New Relic user, you may run the same log queries over and over again to monitor critical patterns, check for specific errors, or generate regular reports. For example, you need to check daily for failed login attempts, monitor weekly error rates, or track hourly performance metrics across your applications. This manual process is time-consuming and makes it easy to miss important insights when you're not actively monitoring.

Scheduled log searches solve this problem by automating your repetitive NRQL queries. You can schedule queries to run automatically and receive results via email, so you'll stay informed about critical log patterns without constant manual monitoring.

<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## What you can do [#features]

Scheduled log searches let you:

* **Automate repetitive queries**: Convert manual log queries into automated workflows that run on your schedule.
* **Stay informed proactively**: Receive email notifications with query results delivered directly to your inbox.
* **Flexible scheduling**: Choose from hourly, daily, weekly, or custom cron expression schedules.
* **Multiple output formats**: Export results as CSV or JSON files attached to email notifications.
* **Team collaboration**: Send scheduled search results to multiple email recipients.
* **Centralized management**: View, edit, and manage all your scheduled searches from a single location.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

To use scheduled log searches, you need:

* **User permissions**: [Workflow Automation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#requirements) permissions are required to create and manage scheduled searches.
* **Account access**: Access to the account where you want to schedule log searches.
* **Email destinations**: Valid email destinations configured for receiving search results.

<Callout variant="important">
  Scheduled log searches are built on New Relic's Workflow Automation infrastructure. Your organization needs appropriate permissions to create and manage workflows.
</Callout>

## Access scheduled searches [#access]

To access scheduled log searches:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. In the left navigation, select **Scheduled searches**.

When you first visit this page, you'll see an empty state with the option to **Schedule a search**.

## Schedule a new search [#create-schedule]

To schedule a new automated log search:

<Steps>
<Step>
From the **Scheduled searches** page, click **Schedule a search** to open the configuration modal.
</Step>
<Step>
**Configure your query and schedule**:

**Query setup**:
* Enter a **Name** for your scheduled search.
* Add an optional **Description** to help identify the search purpose.
* Write your **NRQL query** using the same syntax as in the logs UI.

**Schedule configuration**:
* Choose your preferred **Frequency**:
  * **Hourly**: Runs every hour at the minute mark you specify.
  * **Daily**: Runs once per day at the time you specify.
  * **Weekly**: Runs once per week on the day and time you specify.
  * **Cron expression**: Use custom cron syntax for advanced scheduling.
* Select your **Time zone** for scheduling accuracy.

<Callout variant="tip">
  When writing NRQL queries for scheduled searches, use the same query language you would use in the logs UI. The query will automatically execute against your log data at the scheduled times.
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
**Choose output format and destination**:

**Output format**:
* **CSV**: Results delivered as a comma-separated values file.
* **JSON**: Results delivered as a JSON file.

**Email destination**:
* Select from your existing [alert email destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations).
* Configure new email destinations if needed.
</Step>
<Step>
**Review and confirm** your scheduled search configuration:
* Query name and description.
* NRQL query text.
* Schedule frequency and timing.
* Output format and email destination.
* Time zone settings.

Click **Schedule** to create your automated search.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Manage scheduled searches [#manage]

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="view-searches" title="View existing scheduled searches">
The **Scheduled searches** page displays all your automated searches with:
* Search name and description.
* Schedule frequency and next run time.
* Current status (active, paused, error).
* Creation date and last modified date.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="edit-search" title="Edit a scheduled search">
To modify an existing scheduled search:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, click on the search you want to edit.
2. Update any configuration settings:
   * Query name or description.
   * NRQL query text.
   * Schedule frequency or timing.
   * Output format or email destination.
3. Click **Save changes** to update the schedule.
</Collapser>

<Collapser id="pause-resume" title="Pause or resume a scheduled search">
You can pause scheduled searches to temporarily stop execution without deleting them:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, select the search you want to modify.
