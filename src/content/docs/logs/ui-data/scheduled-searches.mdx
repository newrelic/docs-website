Transform repetitive, manual queries into proactive, automated workflows. With scheduled log searches, you can schedule NRQL queries from your logs UI to receive regular updates on log data via email, helping you stay informed about critical log patterns without constant manual monitoring.

## What you can do [#features]

Scheduled log searches let you:

* **Automate repetitive queries**: Convert manual log queries into automated workflows that run on your schedule
* **Stay informed proactively**: Receive email notifications with query results delivered directly to your inbox
* **Flexible scheduling**: Choose from hourly, daily, weekly, or custom cron expression schedules
* **Multiple output formats**: Export results as CSV or JSON files attached to email notifications
* **Team collaboration**: Send scheduled search results to multiple email recipients
* **Centralized management**: View, edit, and manage all your scheduled searches from a single location

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

To use scheduled log searches, you need:

* **User permissions**: [Workflow Automation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#requirements) permissions are required to create and manage scheduled searches
* **Account access**: Access to the account where you want to schedule log searches
* **Email destinations**: Valid email destinations configured for receiving search results

<Callout variant="important">
  Scheduled log searches are built on New Relic's Workflow Automation infrastructure. Your organization needs appropriate permissions to create and manage workflows.
</Callout>

## Access scheduled searches [#access]

To access scheduled log searches:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. In the left navigation, select **Scheduled searches**.

When you first visit this page, you'll see an empty state with the option to **Schedule a search**.

## Schedule a new search [#create-schedule]

To schedule a new automated log search:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, click **Schedule a search**.
2. Complete the multi-step configuration process:

### Step 1: Configure your query and schedule [#step-1]

1. **Query setup**:
   * Enter a **Name** for your scheduled search
   * Add an optional **Description** to help identify the search purpose
   * Write your **NRQL query** using the same syntax as in the logs UI

2. **Schedule configuration**:
   * Choose your preferred **Frequency**:
     * **Hourly**: Runs every hour at the minute mark you specify
     * **Daily**: Runs once per day at the time you specify
     * **Weekly**: Runs once per week on the day and time you specify
     * **Cron expression**: Use custom cron syntax for advanced scheduling
   * Select your **Time zone** for scheduling accuracy

<Callout variant="tip">
  When writing NRQL queries for scheduled searches, use the same query language you would use in the logs UI. The query will automatically execute against your log data at the scheduled times.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Choose output format and destination [#step-2]

1. **Output format**:
   * **CSV**: Results delivered as a comma-separated values file
   * **JSON**: Results delivered as a JSON file

2. **Email destination**:
   * Select from your existing [alert email destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations)
   * Configure new email destinations if needed

### Step 3: Review and confirm [#step-3]

Review your scheduled search configuration:
* Query name and description
* NRQL query text
* Schedule frequency and timing
* Output format and email destination
* Time zone settings

Click **Schedule** to create your automated search.

## Manage scheduled searches [#manage]

### View existing scheduled searches [#view-searches]

The **Scheduled searches** page displays all your automated searches with:
* Search name and description
* Schedule frequency and next run time
* Current status (active, paused, error)
* Creation date and last modified date

### Edit a scheduled search [#edit-search]

To modify an existing scheduled search:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, click on the search you want to edit.
2. Update any configuration settings:
   * Query name or description
   * NRQL query text
   * Schedule frequency or timing
   * Output format or email destination
3. Click **Save changes** to update the schedule.

### Pause or resume a scheduled search [#pause-resume]

You can pause scheduled searches to temporarily stop execution without deleting them:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, select the search you want to modify.
2. Use the **Pause** button to stop execution or **Resume** to restart.

### Delete a scheduled search [#delete-search]

To permanently remove a scheduled search:

1. From the **Scheduled searches** page, select the search you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** and confirm the action.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Deleting a scheduled search is permanent and cannot be undone. The search will stop running immediately and all historical execution data will be removed.
</Callout>

## Email notifications and results [#email-results]

When your scheduled search executes, you'll receive email notifications containing:

### Email contents [#email-format]

* **Subject line**: Includes the scheduled search name and execution timestamp
* **Summary information**: Query details, execution time, and result count
* **Attached results**: Query results in your chosen format (CSV or JSON)
* **Direct link**: Quick access to view the same query in the logs UI

### Result file formats [#file-formats]

**CSV format**:
* Column headers match log attribute names
* Rows contain individual log entries
* Suitable for spreadsheet analysis and reporting

**JSON format**:
* Structured data with nested attributes preserved
* Ideal for programmatic processing and integrations
* Maintains full log entry structure and metadata

## Schedule frequency options [#frequency-options]

### Hourly schedules [#hourly]
* Runs once every hour at the minute you specify
* Example: Every hour at 15 minutes past (1:15, 2:15, 3:15, etc.)
* Best for: High-frequency monitoring of critical log patterns

### Daily schedules [#daily]
* Runs once per day at the time you specify
* Example: Every day at 9:00 AM in your selected time zone
* Best for: Daily reports, overnight batch processing results

### Weekly schedules [#weekly]
* Runs once per week on the day and time you specify
* Example: Every Monday at 8:00 AM
* Best for: Weekly summaries, periodic trend analysis

### Cron expressions [#cron]
* Use standard cron syntax for custom schedules
* Format: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`
* Example: `0 0 1 * *` (first day of every month at midnight)
* Best for: Complex scheduling requirements, business-specific timing

<Callout variant="tip">
  When using cron expressions, remember that all times are interpreted in the time zone you select during configuration.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Common issues and solutions [#common-issues]

**Schedule not running**:
* Verify your user has Workflow Automation permissions
* Check that the scheduled search is not paused
* Confirm the NRQL query is valid and returns results

**No email received**:
* Verify email destination is correctly configured
* Check your spam/junk folder
* Ensure the query returns data during the scheduled execution time

**Query errors**:
* Test your NRQL query in the logs UI before scheduling
* Ensure your query doesn't exceed execution time limits
* Verify you have access to the log data you're querying

**Permission errors**:
* Contact your admin to verify Workflow Automation permissions
* Ensure you have access to the account containing the log data
* Check that email destinations are properly configured

### Limitations [#limitations]

* **Query timeout**: Scheduled searches are subject to the same query timeout limits as interactive log queries
* **Result size**: Large result sets may be truncated in email attachments
* **Frequency limits**: Minimum scheduling frequency is hourly
* **Email limits**: Standard email size limitations apply to result attachments

## Security and privacy [#security]

Scheduled log searches follow New Relic's standard security practices:

* **Data access**: Users can only schedule searches for log data they have permission to view
* **Email security**: Results are sent only to validated email destinations
* **Query isolation**: Scheduled searches run with the same permissions as the user who created them
* **Audit trail**: All scheduled search activities are logged for security monitoring

For more information about New Relic's security practices, see [Data security and privacy](/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic).
