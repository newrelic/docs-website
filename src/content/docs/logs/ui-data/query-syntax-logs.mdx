Use our Logs UI in [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com) to quickly search through your log data in seconds. Each log lists available attributes in the `log_summary` column. To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute.

  Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more.

## Query structure

Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as `new` and `relic`, or phrases such as `new relic agent`, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this [Lucene tutorial](https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html).

General query rules:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Log query rules
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Case sensitive
      </td>

      <td>
        The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive.

        **Exception:** Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Special characters
      </td>

      <td>
        When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (`\`). This includes special characters such as `+`, `-`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `"`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `/`, or `\`.

        Example: To query for `"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1" 202`, escape the quotes like this:

        `"\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Wildcard searches
      </td>

      <td>
        You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (`*`) to replace zero or more characters.

        Example: `new*relic`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Search with text [#query-text]

To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases.

### Text operators

The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Text operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Matching (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing keywords entered separately:

        `"new" "relic"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Exact matching (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered:

        `"new relic agent"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Either / Or
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered:

        `new OR relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        And
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered:

        `new AND relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        \* Wildcard (zero or more)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them:

        `new*relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered:

        `-new`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered.

        `-"new relic"`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Search with attributes [#query-attributes]

Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field.

### General operators

The following operators can be used by all types of attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        General operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Equal `:`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` equals `chi`:

        `hostname:chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not equal `- :`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` does not equal `chi`.

        `-hostname:chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Contains `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field `hostname` contains `chi`.

        `hostname:*chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not contain `- *`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field `hostname` does not contain `chi`.

        `-hostname:*chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Starts with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` starts with `chi`.

        `hostname:chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Ends with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` ends with `chi`.

        `hostname:*chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Has
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field `user_name`.

        `has:user_name`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Missing
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field `user_name`.

        `missing:user_name`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Numeric operators

The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Numeric operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is greater than `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:>500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than or equal to
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is greater than or equal to `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:>=500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Less than
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is less than `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:<500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Less than or equal to
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is less than or equal to `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:<=500`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
