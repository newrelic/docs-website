## Query structure [#query-structure]

Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as `new` and `relic`, or phrases such as `"new relic agent"`, directly into the search field. 

Plain terms are a "contains" search for the `message` attribute of your logs. For instance, `"New Relic Agent"` is equivalent to the more verbose `message: "*New Relic Agent*"`.  

To search other attributes, prefix the attribute to your terms, such as `source: "*New Relic agent*"`. See "General operators" below for more details.

You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this [Lucene tutorial](https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html).

General query rules:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Log query rules
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Case sensitive
      </td>

      <td>
        The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive.
        
        **Exception:** Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Whitespace characters
      </td>

      <td>
        When a term contains whitespace characters such as the space or tab character, the term will need to be double-quoted.
        
        Example: To query for a `status` attribute that contains exactly `POST /log/v1`, quote the term like this:

        `status: "POST /log/v1"`
        
        Note: to query for a `status` attribute that contains `POST /log/v1` somewhere in the attribute, you'll need to add wildcard characters like `status: "*POST /log/v1*"` (see below for details on wildcards)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Special characters
      </td>

      <td>
        When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (`\`). This includes special characters such as `+`, `-`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `"`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `/`, or `\`.

        Example: To query for a `status` attribute containing exactly `"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1" 202`, escape the quotes like this:

        `status: "\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Wildcard searches
      </td>

      <td>
        You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (`*`) to replace zero or more characters.

        Example: to query for a `status` attribute that contains with `202` somewhere in it, format the query like this:
        
        `status: *202*`

        If your term contains spaces or other metacharacters (see above), you'll need to quote the wildcarded term. 
        
        Example, to query for a `status` attribute that contains `/log/v1 202` somewhere in it, format the query like this:
        
        `status: "*/log/v1 202*"` 
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Search with text [#query-text]

To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases.

### Text operators [#text-operators]

The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Text operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Matching (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing keywords entered separately:

        `"new" "relic"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Exact matching (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered:

        `"new relic agent"`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Either / Or
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered:

        `new OR relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        And
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered:

        `new AND relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        \* Wildcard (zero or more)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them:

        `new*relic`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered:

        `-new`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered.

        `-"new relic"`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Search with attributes [#query-attributes]

Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field.

### General operators [#general-operators]

The following operators can be used by all types of attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        General operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Equal `:`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` equals `chi`:

        `hostname:chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not equal `- :`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` does not equal `chi`.

        `-hostname:chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Contains `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field `hostname` contains `chi`.

        `hostname:*chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not contain `- *`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field `hostname` does not contain `chi`.

        `-hostname:*chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Starts with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` starts with `chi`.

        `hostname:chi*`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Ends with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field `hostname` ends with `chi`.

        `hostname:*chi`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Has
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field `user_name`.

        `has:user_name`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Missing
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field `user_name`.

        `missing:user_name`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Numeric operators [#numeric-operators]

The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Numeric operator example
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is greater than `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:>500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than or equal to
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is greater than or equal to `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:>=500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Less than
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is less than `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:<500`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Less than or equal to
      </td>

      <td>
        Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is less than or equal to `500`.

        `http_response_time_ms:<=500`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Example: Search string in URI for deployments [#example-deployments]

You can build a New Relic URL that includes the log search string in the URI. This is useful, for example, when you want to include a direct link to the New Relic **Logs** UI in a Kubernetes deployment. You want the link to pass a custom URL populated with the search for a specific container name.

Here is an example URL:

```
https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher?platform[accountId]=1234567&launcher=jyJpc0VudGl0&pane=zyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiO=
```

In this search, the query is your Lucene query. Edit these values as applicable:

* `accountId` is your account.
* `eventTypes` are your log partitions (usually `Log`).

You do not need to edit the other values.

The `launcher` is a Base64 encoding of:

```
'{"isEntitled":true,"query":"foo:\\"bar\\" environment:\\"production\\"","eventTypes":["Log"]}'
```

The `pane` is a Base64 encoding of:

```
'{"nerdletId":"logger.log-tailer","accountId":1234567}'
```
