This page outlines the options for management of the **ktranslate** container used by New Relic's network monitoring.

## Container requirements [#container-requirements]

We recommend the following resources for the **ktranslate** container image:

**Disk**

* 100MB available disk space

**CPU**

* SNMP Polling/Trap Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~1,000 devices
* Device Flow Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 flows per second (fps)
* Syslog Message Collection: 1 CPU core dedicated for every ~2,000 messages per second

**Memory**

* **ktranslate** is not generally constrained by memory resources. The amount of memory on your host should be driven by the types of applications/containers you plan to run. For a general idea, we commonly see success with image sizes as small as the [AWS t2.micro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/) which has 1 vCPU and 1.0 GB of available RAM.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The KTranslate container image runs a single "job type" at a time. For instance, a container deployed for SNMP polling and trap collection will not be used for flow collection. Furthermore, containers deployed for flow collection are limited to a single `-nf.source` type per container. This means that it is common to have multiple containers deployed to a single Docker host at any given time. They can also share a common configuration file, but do not have to.
</Callout>

## Updating the container [#updating-the-container]

Keeping the **ktranslate** container image up to date is good practice to both receive the latest updates and resolve common problems through various bug fixes applied during the development lifecycle. It is recommended to always pull the latest available image when redeploying your containers.

1. Pull the latest container image available by running one of the following:
   * [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
     ```shell
     docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2
     ```
   * [Quay.io](https://quay.io/)
     ```shell
     docker pull quay.io/kentik/ktranslate:v2
     ```

2. Collect the IDs and names of any existing containers:

   ```shell
   docker ps -a --filter ancestor=kentik/ktranslate:v2 --format "{{.ID}} - {{.Names}}"
   ```

   Output Example:

   ```
   3297b134a352 - ktranslate-snmp
   4962a854b386 - ktranslate-sflow
   ```

3. Remove any pre-existing containers

   ```shell
   docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID
   ```

4. Redeploy your **ktranslate** container using the original settings you deployed with from either [SNMP](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring), [flow data](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring), or [syslog collection](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-syslog-monitoring).

<Callout variant="important">
  The configuration file used by **ktranslate** is applied to the container at runtime. Changes to this file require you to remove and restart your running container(s) to apply the edits, with the exception of using integrated discovery jobs.
</Callout>

## Container runtime options [#container-runtime-options]

Below are the various options available during Docker runtime for the **ktranslate** container image:

      <td>
        Used to setup **integrated discovery jobs** within the SNMP polling container scheduled to run at a fixed interval. This setting will execute the discovery job, update the provided YAML configuration file, and then restart the SNMP collection threads on the SNMP polling container to remove the need to destroy/restart your entire container for discovered devices.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>
        When combined with the `-snmp_discovery_min` flag being set, KTranslate will immediately run a discovery job on container start, in addition to every X minutes as defined by `-snmp_discovery_min`. This flag has no effect if `-snmp_discovery_min` is not set.

        Lets you process higher volumes of data. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent, or every 1,000 SNMP devices being monitored, or every 2,000 syslog messages per second collected by a container. The default is `1`.

      <td/>

      <td>
        Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic events. This does not speed up the local configuration of flow sample rate on a device, but it can slow it down. Setting this to `1` will enable capturing all flows sent to the container. The default is `1000`.
