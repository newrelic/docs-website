metaDescription: Monitoring and troubleshooting the health of your ktranslate container.
---

While running the KTranslate Docker container for New Relic network monitoring, you can monitor the health of the container to proactively detect potential issues.

The KTranslate container image has the `-tee_logs=true` and `-metrics=jchf` settings available during runtime, which allow it to send health metrics directly to New Relic. These are enabled by default when installing network monitoring via the New Relic guided install. We recommend you to set them up when installing network monitoring manually.

## Logs from KTranslate [#logs]

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you want to check the logs locally from the Docker host, run `docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME`. For example, `docker logs ktranslate-snmp`.
</Callout>

The `-tee_logs=true` option sends logs to New Relic when polling devices. To see them, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs**.
2. In **Find logs where**, enter `collector.name:"ktranslate"` and click **Query logs**.

### Common log searches [#common-log-searches]

Below are some common searches that can be used during troubleshooting to gather data for support:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="container-version"
    title="What version of KTranslate am I running?"
  >
    Logs UI:

    ```shell
    collector.name:"ktranslate" message:"*KTranslate Running -- Version*"
    ```

    NRQL:

    ```sql
    FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate Running -- Version%'
    ```

    Expected Results:

    ```shell
    KTranslate Running -- Version kt-2021-12-06-1546870234; Build Mon Dec  6 22:22:56 UTC 2021
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="docker-arguments"
    title="What arguments were passed to Docker at runtime?"
  >
    Logs UI:

    ```shell
    collector.name:"ktranslate" message:"*KTranslate CLI:*"
    ```

    NRQL:

    ```sql
    FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%KTranslate CLI:%'
    ```

    Expected Results:

    ```shell
    KTranslate CLI: [ktranslate -listen off -mapping /etc/ktranslate/config.json -geo /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb -udrs /etc/ktranslate/udr.csv -api_devices /etc/ktranslate/devices.json -asn /etc/ktranslate/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb -log_level info -snmp /snmp-base.yaml -nr_account_id=2583772 -log_level=info -metrics=jchf -tee_logs=true -service_name=snmp nr1.snmp]
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="container-errors"
    title="What errors am I experiencing?"
  >
    * Without a parsing rule applied to your logs

      Logs UI:

      ```shell
      collector.name:"ktranslate" message:-*\[Info\]*
      ```

      NRQL:

      ```sql
      FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` NOT LIKE '%[Info]%'
      ```

    * With a parsing rule applied to your logs

      Logs UI:

      ```shell
      collector.name:"ktranslate" severity:-"Info"
      ```

      NRQL:

      ```sql
      FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `severity` != 'Info'
      ```

      Expected Results:

      ```shell
      KTranslate>cisco-7513 There was an SNMP polling error with the CustomDeviceMetrics walking OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.21 after 0 retries: request timeout (after 0 retries).
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="match_attributes"
    title="Is my match_attributes filter working on my device?"
  >
    Logs UI:

    ```shell
    collector.name:"ktranslate" message:"*Match Attribute*"
    ```

    NRQL:

    ```sql
    FROM Log SELECT * WHERE `collector.name` = 'ktranslate' AND `message` LIKE '%Match Attribute%'
    ```

    Expected Results:

    ```shell
    KTranslate>cisco-7513 Added 1 Match Attribute(s)
    ```

    All devices are expected to have at least 1 Match Attribute inherited from the default `monitor_admin_shut: true` configuration. You should expect a value of `2` to be shown for a device that you have added a single match attribute to.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can further filter these results by adding the device name to your query: `collector.name:"ktranslate" message:"*$DEVICE_NAME*Match Attribute*"`.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
