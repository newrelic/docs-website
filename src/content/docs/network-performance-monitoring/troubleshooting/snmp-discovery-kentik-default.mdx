## Problem [#problem]

After running a discovery, you are seeing `Kentik Default` entities in the New Relic UI.

## Solution [#solution]

During discovery, `ktranslate` collects the [System Object Identifier](http://oid-info.com/get/1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2), such as sysObjectID or sysOID, which provides an easy way to identify a device. Every device type that responds to SNMP has a sysObjectID, and the value of that ID should be unique enough so anyone can identify which type of device it is.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Check the [CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB list](https://mibs.observium.org/mib/CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB/), which outlines the sysObjectID values for a large number of the various devices Cisco has supported over the years.
</Callout>

Once `ktranslate` knows the sysObjectID for a device, that value is used to match against the known profiles available in the open source [snmp-profiles](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles) repository that Kentik maintains.

If the sysObjectID cannot be matched, then the device is be considered a `Kentik Default` entity. The purpose of this is to provide visualization for users that devices are being monitored, as well as direction on how to help drive a better experience for their specific devices.

### Device type already exists [#device-exists]

In many situations, there is a pre-existing profile that will cover your device that we simply need to add the new sysObjectID to. The first step is to take a look in the [snmp-profiles](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/tree/main/profiles/kentik_snmp) repository to see if there is a directory for your device's vendor, and associated profile file within the directory.

For example, if you have a Cisco Catalyst series switch that is showing up as a `Kentik Default`, but the sysObjectID is not on the [catalyst profile](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/blob/main/profiles/kentik_snmp/cisco/cisco-catalyst.yml), then you can either create a pull request to have it added, or open an issue on the repository and we will get it added on your behalf.

### New device type needed [#device-type-needed]

If no SNMP profile meets your needs, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Creating and managing SNMP profiles](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/snmp-profiles) documentation.
