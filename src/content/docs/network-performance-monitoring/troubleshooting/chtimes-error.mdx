## Problem [#problem]

You've run `docker run`, but nothing seems to be happening and you see, in the docker logs, an error such as

```bash
[Error] KTranslate Discovery SNMP Error: There was an error when writing the /snmp-base.yaml SNMP configuration file: chtimes /snmp-base.yaml: operation not permitted.
```

This happens when the `snmp-base.yaml` file has an ownership permission that prevents the docker user from editing the file, most often because you created the file as the `root` user or a similar privileged account. The docker container runs with a non-privileged user that can't modify this file. Inside the container, `ktranslate` is always trying to use user ID 1000 and group ID 1000, so the ownership needs to allow for those IDs to own the file.

## Solutions [#solutions]

From your privileged account, change the ownership of the file before you can pass it into the docker container. For example, run:

```bash
chown 1000:1000 snmp-base.yaml
```
