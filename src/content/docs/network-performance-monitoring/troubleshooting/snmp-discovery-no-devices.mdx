## Problem [#problem]

You launched an SNMP discovery run but didn't find any devices.

## Solutions [#solutions]

The SNMP discovery process will run against every IP address in your list from the `cidr` section in the discovery configuration. During the scan, there is a TCP port check to ensure the target IP address is responsive. If successful, `ktranslate` will then attempt to communicate with the IP address via SNMP. 

Common failure points in the discovery process include:
* timeouts due to either network latency or device response times to SNMP requests. Meraki Cloud Controllers [recommend at least a 10s timeout](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/SNMP_Overview_and_Configuration) value, for instance. 
* initial failures on the responsiveness check from devices that are generally under tighter security postures, like firewalls.

To work around these problems, try one or both of the following solutions:

1. Edit the `snmp-base.yaml` and increase the timeout value for the `timeout_ms` variable.
2. For devices that still seem unresponsive, set all the `cidrs` values to a length of `/32`, which forces the discovery process to skip the responsiveness check and only attempts the SNMP connection.
