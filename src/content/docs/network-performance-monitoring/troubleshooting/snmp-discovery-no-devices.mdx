metaDescription: SNMP monitoring discovery does not find any devices, or you didn't find all of the devices you expected.

## Problem [#problem]

You launched an SNMP discovery run but didn't find any devices.

## Solutions [#solutions]

The SNMP discovery process will run against every IP address in your list from the `cidr` section in the discovery configuration. During the scan, there is a TCP port check to ensure the target IP address is responsive. If successful, `ktranslate` will then attempt to communicate with the IP address via SNMP.

Common failure points in the discovery process include:

* timeouts due to either network latency or device response times to SNMP requests. Meraki Cloud Controllers [recommend at least a 10s timeout](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/SNMP_Overview_and_Configuration) value, for instance.
* initial failures on the responsiveness check from devices that are generally under tighter security postures, like firewalls.

To work around these problems, try one or both of the following solutions:

1. Edit the `snmp-base.yaml` and increase the timeout value for the `timeout_ms` variable.
2. For devices that still seem unresponsive, set all the `cidrs` values to a length of `/32`, which forces the discovery process to skip the responsiveness check and only attempts the SNMP connection.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have a large set of devices that are being skipped because of the port scan you can edit the `snmp-base.yaml` file and enable the option for [check_all_ips](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/advanced-config/#discovery) to skip the port scan and just go directly to testing SNMP credentials against every address in your discovery. Keep in mind that this option will dramatically increase the time it takes to complete a discovery.
