## Problem [#problem]

During SNMP monitoring, you don't see all of the expected metrics for your device.

## Solutions [#solutions]

Identify what metrics exist in New Relic One by running the following NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT 
uniques(metricName) 
WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'kentik' 
AND device_name = '$DEVICE_NAME'
SINCE 1 HOUR AGO LIMIT MAX
```

<Callout variant="important">
Replace `$DEVICE_NAME` with the name of your device.
</Callout>

This query will give you a list of every dimensional metric being collected on your device in the last hour. If the metric is not listed, you should try:

- [Verify the device responds to target OID](#verify-device-response)
- [Verify the device is matched to the correct profile](#verify-device-matches)
- [Verify the OID is listed in the device profile](#verify-listed-profile)

### Verify the device responds to target OID [#verify-device-response]

Using the [snmpwalk utility](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/troubleshooting/snmp-walk), gather the metrics from the Docker host using the SNMP credentials you configured in the `snmp-base.yaml` configuration file.

If the test fails, the device most likely does not support the OID you want to collect. This is a limitation of the device itself, as controlled by the vendor.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you are using SNMP v3, validate the configuration of the v3 user on the device. In most situations, device administrators need to explicitly grant access to MIBs for a v3 user account.
</Callout>

### Verify the device is matched to the correct profile [#verify-device-matches]

If the previous test passes, verify that the configured value for `mib_profile` in your `snmp-base.yaml` file matches the correct profile file name. For example:

```yaml
devices:
  deviceOne:
    ...
    mib_profile: cisco-catalyst.yml
    ...
```

You can check this in New Relic One with the following NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT 
latest(instrumentation.name) 
WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'kentik' 
AND device_name = '$DEVICE_NAME'
```

<Callout variant="important">
Replace `$DEVICE_NAME` with the name of your device.
</Callout>

The library of SNMP profiles is constantly being updated, and sometimes the container image you're using doesn't have the profile settings you're seeking. If the `mib_profile` doesn't match the expected profile, you can either manually update your configuration file, or run a new discovery.

You should always pull the latest image for your container before making changes by running `docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2`.

### Verify the OID is listed in the device profile [#verify-listed-profile]

If all the previous tests pass, check whether the OID exists in the device profile itself. Whether the OID is listed and not working as expected, or the OID needs to be added to the profile, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/issues/new/choose) to contact the repository maintainers so they work towards a resolution.
