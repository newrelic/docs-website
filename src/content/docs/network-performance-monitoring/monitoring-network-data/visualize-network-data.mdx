After you've set up your network data for performance monitoring, you can go to New Relic One to install several custom curated visualizations designed specifically for network performance monitoring.

Once you've set up these visualizations, you'll be able to start exploring the network data your devices are reporting to New Relic One.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

- A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
- Having set up your Network Performance Monitoring devices. Read how to:
  - [Set up SNMP data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring).
  - [Set up network flow data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring).
- Add the custom visualizations app to your account:
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **Apps**, and search for **Network Agent Visualizations**.
    2. Click the app, and then click **Open visualization**.
