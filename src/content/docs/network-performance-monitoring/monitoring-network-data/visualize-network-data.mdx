After you set up your network data for performance monitoring, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Network** to explore the network data your devices are reporting to New Relic.

You can group and monitor your switches, routers, etc. in dashboards. This helps you quickly aggregate, isolate, and analyze the health of your network.
