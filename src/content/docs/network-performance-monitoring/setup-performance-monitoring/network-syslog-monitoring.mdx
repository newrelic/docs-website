You can use our guided install process to install the syslog monitoring agent, or install the agent manually. This doc covers prerequisites to start this install process and a step-by-step walk through of your install options. 

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you can start, you'll need to [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). If you choose to install the agent manually, you also need: 

  * A New Relic [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id).
  * A New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.

We recommend using a Docker container to deploy the agent for syslog message collection. To use it, you need:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) installed in a Linux host
* Ability to launch new containers via command line

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="linux"
        title="Linux host prerequisites"
    >
If you're using Linux to install the agent as a service, you need:

* SSH access to the host
* Access to install/remove applications and services
* One of these supported operating systems:
    * CentOS 7
    * CentOS 8
    * Debian 12 (Bookworm)
    * Debian 11 (Bullseye)
    * Debian 10 (Buster)
    * RedHat Enterprise Linux 9
    * Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal LTS)
    * Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy LTS)
    * Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar)

<Callout variant="important">
  To receive syslog messages, the agent must bind to UDP 514. In a host-based install, the following command will be included during the install process. When executed, KTranslate will be run with elevated privileges.
  
  `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/bin/ktranslate`
</Callout>

  `ktranslate` handles syslog in the following formats: [RFC3164](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164), [RFC5424](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424), and [RFC6587](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6587). Any messages received outside of these formats will be discarded. (Notably, this includes syslogs from Meraki, which don't align with any RFC standards.)
</Callout>

* Source devices must be configured to send syslog messages to the host running the network monitoring agent. Here's how to configure network syslog export in some devices (this is not an all-inclusive list):

## Set up network syslog monitoring in New Relic [#setup-network-syslog-monitoring]

For most use cases, we recommended our guided install to set up network flow data monitoring. If your set up is more advanced with custom configurations, then we'd recommend installing manually. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="guided-install-setup"
    title="Set up with the guided install"
  >
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Add more data**.
    2. Scroll down until you see **Network** and click **Syslog**.
    3. Follow the steps outlined in the guided installation process. You can use Docker or Linux.

    4. Investigate your device syslog messages in the New Relic <InlinePopover type="logs" /> UI, using the following query:

      ```sql
      "plugin.type":"ktranslate-syslog"
      ```

    Here's a short video (2:56 minutes) showing how to set up network syslog monitoring:

  <Collapser

    title="Manual container setup"
  >
    If you follow this manual installation process, support may be unable to assist you if issues arise. If you still wish to proceed, do the following:

    1. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the **ktranslate** image by running one of the following:

      * [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
        ```shell
        docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2
        ```
      * [Quay.io](https://quay.io/)
        ```shell
        docker pull quay.io/kentik/ktranslate:v2
        ```

    2. Copy the `snmp-base.yaml` file to the local `$HOME` directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running

      ```shell
      cd .
      id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2)
      docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml .
      docker rm -v $id
      ```

    3. Edit the `snmp-base.yaml` file, and add your network syslog devices inside the `devices` dictionary key with the following structure:

      ```yaml
      devices:
        # This key and the corresponding 'device_name'
        # need to be unique for each device
        edge_router:
          device_name: edge_router
          device_ip: 10.10.1.254
          ping_only: true
          # Optional user tags
          user_tags:
            owning_team: net_eng
            environment: production
      ```

      <Callout variant="important">
        If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that will also send network syslog, you'll want to ensure that the value for `device_name` is identical for both configuration files to ensure the syslog messages are attributed to the right entity in the New Relic UI.
      </Callout>

    4. Run `ktranslate` to listen for network syslog messages by running:

      ```shell
      docker run -d --name ktranslate-syslog --restart unless-stopped --pull=always -p 162:1620/udp \
      -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \
      # Replace with your license key
      -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY \
      kentik/ktranslate:v2 \
        -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \
        # Replace with your account ID
        -nr_account_id=$YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \
        # If your organization is located in Europe, add the following flag:
        # -nr_region=EU \
        # If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints:
        # -nr_region=GOV \
        -metrics=jchf \
        -tee_logs=true \
        # Use this field to create a unique value for `tags.container_service` inside of New Relic
        -service_name=$UNIQUE_NAME \
        # Optional: To override the default listening port of "0.0.0.0:5143":
        # -syslog.source="<ip_address>:<port>" \
        # Optional: To set a custom DNS server for IP resolution
        # -dns="$DNS_SERVER" \
        nr1.syslog
      ```
    
    5. Investigate your device syslog messages in the New Relic <InlinePopover type="logs" /> UI, using the following query:

      ```sql
      "plugin.type":"ktranslate-syslog"
      ```

## What's next? [#whats-next]

You can set up some additional agents to complement your network syslog data:

* To get better visibility into your network device performance, [set up SNMP data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring).

* To get better visibility into how your network is being used, [set up network flow data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring).
