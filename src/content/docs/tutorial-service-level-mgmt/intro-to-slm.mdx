Within an organization, communication between stakeholders too often proves painful. IT departments usually don't speak in terms that the business side can understand, and the business doesn't normally speak in terms that IT teams find useful. To improve reliability, resolving the observability language barrier helps tremendously. Service level management, the practice of standardizing data into a universal language that all parties can understand, helps you do just that.

This need for a universal language to articulate reliability has re-popularized service level management as a concept. Service level management best applies to the practice of **Uptime, performance and reliability**; however, service level management also applies to the other practices of **Customer experience**, **Innovation and growth**, and **Operational efficiency** ([learn more about these practices](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/introduction)).

Implementing SLM has two major areas of impact: business outcomes and operational outcomes.

        The required business outcome in the practice of reliability is to reduce the number of business-impacting incidents, their duration, and the number of people involved in those incidents.

        1. Reduce the number of business-disrupting incidents
        2. Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR)
        3. Reduce average people engaged (FTEs) per severe incident

        The required operational outcome of service level management within a reliability practice is to communicate digital product health successfully. Operational success is measured by what percentage of critical product applications are covered by standard service levels and percentage of adoption by primary stakeholders. This is achieved by staying focused on what is important to the stakeholders, standardization, ensuring simplicity, a sprinkle of consulting, and proving the effectiveness of service level management.

Let's take a look at some of the common terms and establish what KPIs are before proceeding.

## Terminology [#terminology]

Here are some terms it may help you to understand before using this guide:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-service-level"
    title="Service level"
  >
    A [service level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level) measures the performance of a system, not exclusive to technology. Service levels are measured by indicators and compared against objectives set for expected performance and outcomes.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-service-level-management"
    title="Service level management"
  >
    Service level management is the practice of managing and reporting on service level compliance and attainment.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-sli"
    title="Service level indicator"
  >
A service level indicator (SLI) is a measure of a service level. An SLI identifies the thing or things to be measured. An SLI can be one datapoint or a composite of datapoints. In technology an SLI is most commonly represented as a percentage (%) of successful transactions or events. The mathematical representation is the total good events over the total valid events calculated over a specified period of time such as 1-hour, 1-day, 1-week.

**Examples SLIs:**
* Percentage of login API transactions that complete within 500 milliseconds.
* Percentage of login API transactions that complete without an internal server error.
* Percentage of login API transactions that complete within 500 milliseconds and without an internal server error.
* Percentage of synthetic check Pings against the Login API that are successful.
* Percentage of browser logins that transition to the landing page within 3 seconds.
* Percentage of metrics ingested that are available for query within 3 seconds.
* Some or all of the above aggregated into a single SLI.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-slo"
    title="Service level objective"
  >
A service level objective (SLO) is a statement describing the expected service level of a system, job, and/or capability. An SLO usually describes the required percentage of success of one or more SLIs within a given period of time.

**Example SLOs:**
* The login API will respond within 500 milliseconds and error free 99.99% of the time each week.
* The mobile login capability will transition to the landing page within 3 seconds 99.99% of the time each week.
* The data ingest of metrics will be available for query within 3 seconds of consumption from the API 99.99% of the time each day.

  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-service-boundary"
    title="Service boundary"
  >
A service boundary is the point in a system where the consumer client connects to make requests. This is most commonly referred to as the external API or endpoint.

Service boundaries can also be internal between two distinct systems, where the collection of applications serves the requests of another collection of applications. For example, an identity management system can be a dependency for both login requests from the client and permissions authorization for different features.

Types of boundaries:
* **Internal service boundary**: These are usually middleware dependencies behind the customer-facing GraphQL API. Each dependency API that responds to the GraphQL tier would be considered its own internal service boundary. Internal service boundaries do not represent overall output performance health in a 1:1 ration. For example, a customer request to the GraphQL API could hit seven internal dependencies. One slow dependency will not be the total sum response time of the original request.
* **Customer-facing service boundary**: The customer-facing GraphQL API. This boundary will give you the total sum response time and success metrics required for measuring performance health, without the need to measure each dependency.

  <Collapser
    id="slm-terminology-error-budget"
    title="Error budget"
  >
An error budget is an advanced method to measure and communicate your service level objective compliance. New Relic is currently exploring different methods of error budgeting as described in the references below. Please refer to our [service level management product documentation](/docs/service-level-management/intro-slm) for the most recent information.

An error budget is how much you are allowed to fail before you are considered "out of compliance." There are multiple methods for defining and measuring error budgets. The word "error" in "error budget" does not mean HTTP request errors or application errors as in a "500 Internal Server Error" but simply "any bad request or event" as defined in your service level objectives.

**Note**: It's recommended to first build competency in defining, calculating, and communicating service level compliance before implementing error budgets. See [operational outcomes](#operational-outcomes) above. The really important part is that you will establish a target for you SLIs (objective) and you will measure your success of how well your SLI meets that target. For example, are you within 500 milliseconds and error-free on 99.99% each 24-hour period of your login requests? If your 24-hour SLI compliance result is 99.99%, then you are meeting your objective.

**References**

Google defines error budget as:

"In a nutshell, an error budget is the amount of error that your service can accumulate over a certain period of time before your users start being unhappy. Once you define an objective for each (SLI) for your service-level objective (SLO) — the error budget is the remainder, up to 100." -- [Google Cloud - How maintenance windows affect your error budget—SRE tips](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-error-budgets-and-maintenance-windows)

Atlassian defines error budget as:

"An error budget is the maximum amount of time that a technical system can fail without contractual consequences. For example, if your service level agreement (SLA) specifies that systems will function 99.99% of the time before the business has to compensate customers for the outage, that means your error budget (or the time your systems can go down without consequences) is 52 minutes and 35 seconds per year." -- [Atlassian - What is an error budget and why does it matter?](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/error-budget)
