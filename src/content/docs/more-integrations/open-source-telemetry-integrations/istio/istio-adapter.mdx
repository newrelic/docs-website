[Istio](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/mixer-overview/) provides a flexible model to enforce authorization policies and collect telemetry for the services in a mesh. New Relic's Istio adapter exports telemetry data from your Istio instance to your New Relic account.

Resources for our Istio adapter:

## Enable Istio adapter [#install]

To enable our Istio adapter:

1. If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever. 
2. Follow the [Istio adapter install instructions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter).
3. Optional: Instead of using the native Istio trace sampling, you can enable our [Infinite Tracing](/docs/introduction-infinite-tracing) feature. If you use this option, you will typically want to configure Istio to send us all trace data ([learn more about sampling](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing#integrations)). To enable Infinite Tracing:
   1. In the New Relic UI, [set up a trace observer](/docs/infinite-tracing-set-trace-observer#set-up).
   2. Configure our Istio adapter to send data to the trace observer: Set the [`spansHost`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter/blob/master/helm-charts/values.yaml#L40-L41) value with [<var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>](/docs/infinite-tracing-set-trace-observer#ui-endpoints) when [deploying the Helm chart](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter/tree/master#deploy-helm-template).

## Find your data

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Your applications** > **Explorer**. From the **Entities** screen, search for your service by name. From there, you can explore your metrics using the **Data explorer** and build dashboards using your metrics. If you're sending distributed tracing data, the distributed tracing feature is available to query and view traces.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).
