New Relic offers an integration with Atlassian Jira that enables the incident tab feature within Jira. This feature syncs all your New Relic issue and incident information with Atlassian. This data then appears in Jira on the incidents tab and lets you connect it with Jira issues to improve your outage workflows. The sections cover how you set up this integration and the best practices for usage.

<Callout title="PREVIEW FEATURE">
    This feature is still in preview, but we encourage you to try it out!
</Callout>


## Data sharing [#data-sharing]

Once you install the integration, you allow New Relic for Jira to perform these actions:

* Read entities, incidents, and issues from Jira.
* Write entities, incidents, and issues to Jira.
* Delete entities, incidents, and issues from both New Relic and Jira to mirror data reporting with each entity.

<Callout variant="caution">
    This integration will expose your New Relic issues and incident information to all users in the related Jira workspace. Jira users in this workspace may not have access to New Relic, and even if they do, they may not have access to the same New Relic accounts as your API key user. 

    If you have New Relic account information to hide, use an [integration user](/docs/more-integrations/best-practices-integration/#integration-user-leverage) that doesn't have access to your sensitive accounts.

## Installation [#installation]

Follow these steps to integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install the New Relic marketplace application [#install-marketplace]

You need to install the New Relic errors inbox for Jira to keep your data in sync between New Relic and Atlassian. Keep in mind that you must have the Jira site administrator permission to install marketplace applications. Go to [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1227457/new-relic-errors-inbox-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and click the **Install** button.

<Callout variant="tip">
    If you don't have the site admin permission, you can request it from your administrator. We recommend that you follow up with your Jira site administrator to complete the application install process.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

## Create a New Relic API key [#create-new-relic-key]

After the installation of the New Relic Atlassian Marketplace application, you need to create a [New Relic API key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). The Jira site administrator and the New Relic administrator will decide on the exposed accounts to Jira. The users that have the correct New Relic account access, could generate a New Relic API key. The New Relic API keys have access to the same accounts as the user who generated them.

Create and manage your API keys from the [New Relic API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) page or log in to the [Atlassian API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) page and click **Create API token**.

</Step>

<Step>

## Apply a New Relic API key [#apply-new-relic-key]

Once you've created an API key, you can apply that key to the first page of the New Relic connect application. 

Paste your New Relic API token into the New Relic Atlassian Marketplace application and click **Connect**.

    src={opentelemetryAtlassianNRapiToken}
    />


</Step>
<Step>
## Select your New Relic services [#select-nr-services]

Once you've created an API key in the New Relic Atlassian Marketplace application, you'll see a list of all entities associated with the accounts on that API key. Open the Jira incident management page and select all the entities that you want to expose in Jira.

    title="Jira incident management page"
    alt="Jira incident management page"
    src={opentelemetryJiraIncidentManagement}
    />


</Step>
<Step>
## See New Relic issues and incidents in Atlassian Jira [#see-issues-incidents]

After you've selected your New Relic entities, the application starts syncing data from New Relic into Atlassian Jira. Open the incidents tab to see a list of detected incidents.


</Step>

</Steps>

## Enable the incidents tab [#enable-incidents-tab]

You may need to link to the Atlassian documentation. It walks a Jira site admin through enabling the incidents tab and assigning it to a workspace. There's a chance they are going to enable by default and then, you won't need this section.


## Remove a connection between New Relic and Atlassian Jira [#remove-connection]

You can stop syncing data from New Relic at any time and removing the synced data. As a Jira site administrator, you can do this from your Atlassian Marketplace configuration page. You can select your connected organization and click **Delete**. After it finishes, you will no longer see New Relic incidents and issue information present in the incidents tab in Jira.

## Connect to a different organization or user [#different-conexion]

At any point, you may connect to the wrong New Relic organization, or you may want to adjust the account access your API key provides. You can do this from your Atlassian Marketplace page. When you click the **Connect another New Relic organization**, you'll need to provide a New Relic API key. Giving a new key will delete your current connection and includes all data synced to Atlassian. Then, a new sync process will start with the account and organization access of the new API key.
