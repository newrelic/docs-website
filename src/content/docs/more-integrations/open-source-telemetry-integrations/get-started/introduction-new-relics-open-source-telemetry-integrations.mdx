New Relic provides open source integrations that report telemetry data from telemetry tools to your New Relic account.

## Types of integrations [#about]

We have open source integrations that report data from OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, DropWizard, Prometheus, and [more](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations). With these solutions, you can aggregate all your telemetry data in one place: the New Relic platform.

See [our list of open source telemetry integrations](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations) (to browse all New Relic solutions, see [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/)).

## How they work

These integrations were built using our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic), which are open-source language-specific libraries for reporting metrics, trace data, and other telemetry data to New Relic. If our pre-built [quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/) don't meet your needs, you can use the [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic) to build your own telemetry tools.

Under the hood, data reported by these solutions are ingested via our [data ingest APIs](/docs/data-ingest-apis). For example, metrics reported by the DropWizard exporter are ingested via the [Metric API](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api), so to understand how to query and chart that type of data, you could read [Query metric data](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data).
