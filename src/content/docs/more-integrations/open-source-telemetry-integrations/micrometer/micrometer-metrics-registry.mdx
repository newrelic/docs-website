## Find your data

To find your data, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All entities**. Search for your service by name. We provide an out-of-the-box overview that includes charts for some of the most useful metrics provided by Micrometer Spring Boot instrumentation.

You can use the out-of-the-box overview as a starting point to build your own dashboards. Click on the `...` icon in a chart to add that chart to a dashboard or view the query behind the chart to modify it and it add it to your dashboard.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).
