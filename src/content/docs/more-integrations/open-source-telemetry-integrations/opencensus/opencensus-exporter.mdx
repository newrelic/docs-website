[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) is a set of libraries for various languages that allow you to collect application metrics and distributed traces, then transfer the data to a backend of your choice. New Relic's OpenCensus exporters send telemetry data from your OpenCensus-instrumented applications to your New Relic account.

## Enable exporter [#install]

To enable a New Relic OpenCensus exporter:

1. If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever. 
2. Follow the install procedures:
   * [Go language exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go)
   * [Python language exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-python)
3. Optional: Instead of using the native OpenCensus trace sampling, you can enable our [Infinite Tracing](/docs/introduction-infinite-tracing) feature. If you do this, you will typically want to configure OpenCensus to send us all trace data ([learn more about sampling](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing#integrations)). To enable Infinite Tracing:
   1. In the New Relic UI, [set up a trace observer](/docs/infinite-tracing-set-trace-observer#set-up).
   2. Configure the exporter to send data to the trace observer:
      * Go exporter: Set the [`SpansURLOverride`](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Config) field on the `Config` object with [<var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>](/docs/infinite-tracing-set-trace-observer#ui-endpoints) when creating the [Exporter](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go/nrcensus#NewExporter).
      * Python exporter: Pass the host parameter to the [trace exporter](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-python/api.html#opencensus_ext_newrelic.trace.NewRelicTraceExporter "Link opens in a new window.") using [<var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST</var>](/docs/infinite-tracing-set-trace-observer#ui-endpoints).

## Find your data [#find-data]

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Explorer**. From the **Entities** screen, search for your service by name. From there, you can explore your metrics using the **Data explorer** and build dashboards using your metrics. If you're also sending distributed tracing data, the distributed tracing feature is available to query and view traces.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).
