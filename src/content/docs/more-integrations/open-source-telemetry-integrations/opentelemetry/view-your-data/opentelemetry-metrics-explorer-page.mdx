import opentelemetryMetricExplorer from 'images/opentelemetry_screenshot-full_metric-explorer.webp'

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click **Metrics explorer** to see information about your metrics (for selected OpenTelemetry languages). Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here.
