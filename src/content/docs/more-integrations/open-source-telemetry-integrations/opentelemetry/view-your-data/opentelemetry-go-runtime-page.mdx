After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click **Go runtime** to identify which service instances have unusual or unhealthy performance patterns related to the language runtime.

<Callout variant="important">
  You must install a separate instrumentation package to gather the runtime metrics used in this view. See [Runtime metric details](#metric-details) below.
</Callout>

You can choose several service instances to compare based on summaries of key metrics: response time, throughput, error rate, garbage collection time, and memory usage. Then, you can compare all those instances' metrics using timeseries charts to spot problems and determine whether garbage collection, goroutines, or other runtime resources are involved.

Here's a typical workflow:

1. Click **Go runtime**.
2. Find interesting Go runtime instances using the table of summarized health metrics:
   * Use the filter bar to narrow down your search.
   * Sort to find outliers, for example, instances with higher garbage collection time.
3. Select those interesting Go runtime instances.
4. Click **Compare** to see a display of the health and runtime metrics faceted by instance.

      When you drill into a specific instance or compare several instances, the UI will display charts driven by Go runtime metric data. You can find the instrumentation that generates Go runtime metrics [here](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/runtime).

      In the table and charts, you can [choose to use either metrics or spans](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-find-entities/#metric-span-toggle) to power the golden signals (also known as health metrics): response time, throughput, error rate.

      The runtime metrics, such as those on garbage collection, memory usage, and goroutines, are only available from metric data and not spans. So, they're not affected by this toggle switch.

      For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the `service.instance.id` resource attribute for rendering the list of Go runtime instances.
