After you send OpenTelemetry data to New Relic, you can use a variety of UI pages to analyze it. Take a look at these options:

  * [Find entities and data:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-find-entities) Find your entities and drill in to the most relevant data
  * [Summary:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-summary-page) See overall service health and begin troubleshooting
  * [Distributed tracing:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-distributed-tracing-page) Follow requests through your distributed system that involve this service
  * [Transactions:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-transactions-page) Tune performance of requests to a service's endpoints and diagnose latency problems
  * [Databases:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-database-page) Monitor your database calls
  * [External services:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-external-services-page) See how requests between your service and others are performing, down to the endpoints involved
  * [JVMs:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-jvms-page) Monitor your JVM performance
  * [Logs:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-logs-page) Diagnose problems with application logs
  * [Errors page:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-errors-page) See which errors users of your service are experiencing
  * [Errors inbox:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-errors-inbox-page) Triage and resolve errors
  * [Metrics explorer:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-metrics-explorer-page) Look at specific metrics
  * [Create custom queries:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-data-explorer-query-builder) Try out these do-it-yourself tools to drill into your data

## Conventions for OpenTelemetry data [#conventions]
The OpenTelemetry project specifies semantic conventions for [metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions), [traces](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions), [logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/logs/semantic_conventions) and [events](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/semantic_conventions/events.md) so that telemetry can be interpreted consistently by observability tools. New Relic relies on these conventions to present telemetry data in the UI.

OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation agents and SDKs generally follow the semantic conventions, but as the project is in rapid development, it's possible you may have to adjust your instrumentation to match the conventions.

If data is not showing up how you'd expect in the UI, look in the relevant UI page's documentation, where you can find a reference for the semantic conventions used on that page.
