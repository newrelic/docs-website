In addition to viewing your OpenTelemetry data in our curated views, you can also view data by constructing your own custom queries. Our **Metrics & events** and **Query builder** pages can help you dig into your data.

## Metrics & events [#general-metrics-traces]

The tool called **Metrics & events** helps you construct queries of metrics, logs, and traces without having to use the NRQL query language directly.

You can find this query tool by clicking the **Metrics & events** tile at [one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities). For tips about how to use this, see [Introduction to the metrics and events data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).

## Query builder [#query-builder]

If you prefer to write your own database queries using NRQL, you can use our tool called query builder. You can find this tool by clicking on the **Query your data** tile at [one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities). To learn more about how to construct queries with NRQL, see [Introduction to querying data in New Relic](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).
