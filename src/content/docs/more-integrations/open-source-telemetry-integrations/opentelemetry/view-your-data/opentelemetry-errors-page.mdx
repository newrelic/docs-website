---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click on **Errors** to see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

For your data to appear in this page, make sure it has the following:

* `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
* `otel.status_code = ERROR`
* Facets by span name
