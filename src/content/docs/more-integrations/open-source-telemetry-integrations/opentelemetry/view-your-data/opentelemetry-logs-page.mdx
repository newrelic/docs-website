After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click on **Logs** to see data about your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our [OpenTelemetry and logging documentation](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs).

For your data to appear in this section of the UI, do the following:

* Make sure your logs are correlated with your service via `service.name`. For details, see [Correlate your application logs](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs#log-correlation).
* To correlate with trace data, the logs need to include the trace context that is contained `trace_id` and `span_id`.  While OpenTelemetry instrumentation is likely to inject trace context as `trace_id` and `span_id`, the New Relic UI expects the fields to be `trace.id` and `span.id`. You'll need to configure rules in your log pipeline to translate `trace_id` and `span_id` to `trace.id` and `span.id`.
