metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry database page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, click **Databases** to learn about the performance of the database queries your service is making. You can see which database calls (e.g., `SELECT` operation on the `ads` table) are taking the most time in total or on average, or have the most throughput. Then you can investigate performance of an individual call and find traces that involve it.

## Required attributes [#required-attributes]

With OpenTelemetry, spans have a [`SpanKind`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind). `SpanKind=CLIENT` describes a span that represents a call to a remote service, like a database. We use `SpanKind=CLIENT` paired with the presence of the [`db.system`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/database.md) attribute to identify spans representing a call to a database.

For your OpenTelemetry data to appear in the **Databases** page, make sure it has the following attributes, in accordance with the OTel semantic conventions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Top database calls
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by span `name`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by query time)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by throughput)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
