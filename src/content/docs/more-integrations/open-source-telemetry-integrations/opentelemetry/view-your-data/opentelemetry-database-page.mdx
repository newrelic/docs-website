metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry database page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click **Databases** to see your application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Top database calls
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by query time)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by throughput)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
