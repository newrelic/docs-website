Once you've sent your data to New Relic, you can view it by service (entity) in the UI. You have a number of options to locate your services and their associated data in the UI.

Once you find the service to view, you'll land on the **Summary** page. From there, several views will be available that offer deeper insight into the data associated with that service. You can then filter that data to answer questions about how particular aspects of your service are performing.

## Find your service (entity) [#find-entity]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. In the left sidebar, click either **All entities** or **APM & services**.
3. In the center pane, click **Services - OpenTelemetry**.
4. Click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering its name in the top filter bar.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Use `CONTROL-K` to search for your service by name from anywhere in the UI.

  You may have to look for your OpenTelemetry service in the **Other** category if there are many matches for your search terms.

### Find your service using tags [#tags]

[Tags](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) are key-value pairs you can add to entities, like monitored apps and hosts. Certain important data attributes are automatically assigned as tags, such as account ID. You can also add your own [custom tags](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources#tags). 

In the New Relic UI, you can filter lists of entities by one or more tags to find the service you're looking for:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. Click the **Filter by...** field. A dropdown will populate available tags, or you can enter a tag's name or value yourself.

## Narrow down your data with filters [#filter]

Once you have your entity, you can then filter for data from your service.

With the filter bar **Narrow data to...**, you can highlight a specific facet of the telemetry recorded for your service. For example, you may want to see the error rate for a particular version of the service that you've deployed in a canary instance, so you add a filter for `service.version='1.2.3'`.

Filters are preserved when navigating between different views of your data for a service. For example, the filter you set on **Summary** for `service.version='1.2.3'` carries over to the **Transactions** view, so that you would see telemetry on requests to the endpoints (transactions) that are running version 1.2.3 of your service, and not any other versions.

Filters are preserved when navigating between the **Summary**, **Transactions**, **Databases**, **External services**, **Errors**, and **JVMs** views.

Filters are also preserved when navigating to the **Distributed tracing** view, but with limitations. Only filter conditions that use the equals operator ("=") are currently supported when navigating to **Distributed tracing**. If you navigate back from the **Distributed tracing** page, the filters you selected on the previous view will come back.

## Control the data type that populates certain charts [#metric-span-toggle]

When you're looking at OpenTelemetry data in the **Summary**, **Transactions**, and **JVMs** page of the UI, you can decide whether metrics or trace spans drive your charts. At the top of the page, flip the toggle to change the display:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the metric-span toggle at the top of the Summary page."
  alt="Screenshot showing the metric-span toggle at the top of the Summary page."
  src={opentelemetryMetricSpanToggleSummary}
/>

The spans-metrics toggle defaults to spans, but you can set the toggle to what you want for each service. Your choice is saved for each entity as you navigate between services.

Before you change the toggle, consider these aspects of the feature:

  * Spans could be sampled. Sampling could mean that certain measurements, throughput in particular, may be inaccurate.

  * Metrics are not subject to the effects of sampling.

  * Auto-instrumentation in the OpenTelemetry community's agents is evolving rapidly, but at present, metrics are not yet reported automatically for all languages. Or, when writing your own OpenTelemetry instrumentation, you may choose not to report certain metrics.

  * The attributes recorded on metrics and on spans could differ, depending on your instrumentation. When they do, group or filter selections in the UI that work on spans may not work on metrics, or vice versa.

For any combination of these reasons, it may be better for you to look at the performance of your services using one type of data or the other. The spans-metrics toggle lets you make that choice.
