<Callout title="Preview">
  The option to query events is available only through a preview, but if you sign up, you can try out the Events API. If you'd like to participate in the preview, let us know in our [CNCF Slack channel, #otel-newrelic](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP).

OpenTelemetry recently introduced the experimental [Events API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) in its specification. This API allows you to create an `EventLogger`, which can emit `Events` as `LogRecords` containing two special attributes:
* `event.domain`: The domain of the emitted events. It needs to be set during the creation of the `EventLogger`.
* `event.name`: The event name. This attribute is what New Relic uses to map an OpenTelemetry event to a [New Relic event type](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#general).

So, if your application emits an event with `event.domain=DefaultEventDomain` and `event.name=ApiRequest`, you will be able to find these events under the `ApiRequest` event type in New Relic. Here's an example of how to view the data using [query builder](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-data-explorer-query-builder):

Note that both `event.type` and `event.domain` need to be included in the OpenTelemetry events for them to become available as events in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Events API already [enforces this](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) through the `EventLogger` and `Events` constructor or factory method interfaces.
