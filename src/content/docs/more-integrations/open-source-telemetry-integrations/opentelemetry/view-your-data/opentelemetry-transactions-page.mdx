metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry Transactions page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, click on **Transactions** to identify slow transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. Once you identify a transaction with a problem, you can drill in to details on that transaction's performance and see distributed traces involving that transaction.

New Relic's notion of a [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#txn-defined) encapsulates one logical unit of work in a software application--generally, this is work performed by a single process.

## Metrics or spans [#metrics-or-spans]

You can [choose to use either metrics or spans](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-find-entities/#metric-span-toggle) to power the the **Transactions** view.

  When choosing metrics, transactions are only shown for HTTP servers. Transactions for gRPC service methods or other protocols are not yet shown.

## Required attributes [#required-attributes]

With OpenTelemetry, we rely on [`SpanKind`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind) for mapping trace data to our concept of a transaction. A `SpanKind` of `server` or `consumer` is used to identify the entry point of a process. In other words, these are spans that are either root spans or child spans of a remote process.

For your OpenTelemetry data to appear in the **Transactions** page, make sure it has the following attributes, in accordance with the OTel semantic conventions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Metrics or spans?
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Metrics
      </td>

      <td>
        * `http.server.duration`
        * Facets by `http.route` OR `http.target`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Spans
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * Facets by span `name`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
