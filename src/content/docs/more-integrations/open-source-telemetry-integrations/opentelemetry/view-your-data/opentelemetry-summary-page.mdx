metaDescription: Tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry service Summary page in the New Relic UI
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, the **Summary** page offers an overview of your service's health. Here you can see:
* The **golden signals** for your service: response time, throughput, and error rate
* Entities this service depends on, with their health status, appear in **Related entities**. This includes other services communicating with this service and the infrastructure hosting the service.
* When alerting thresholds are violated, those events appear in the **Activity** sidebar

By using this information, you can quickly decide whether there's a problem with this service and where you can begin diagnosing the problem.

## How OpenTelemetry data shows up (server or client?) [#server-client]

The **Summary** page shows the golden signals for the server and/or message consumer roles of a service. Other pages offer different views of the service's roles in your distributed system:
* **External services** shows the service's behavior as a client calling other services, as well as a breakdown of how other services call its endpoints
* **Databases** shows the service's behavior as a client of databases, specifically

Services can be both servers (responding to requests) and clients (making requests) in the [OpenTelemetry data model for tracing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/). Similarly, services using messaging systems like AWS SQS can be producers and/or consumers of messages. The `span.kind` attribute specifies the role of the service in a given tracing span.

## Metrics or spans [#metrics-or-spans]
You can [choose to use either metrics or spans](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-find-entities/#metric-span-toggle) to power the charts for the golden signals.

<Callout variant="important">
  When choosing metrics, error rate is displayed only for HTTP servers. The error rate metrics for gRPC or other protocols are not yet shown.
</Callout>

## Required attributes
For your OpenTelemetry data to appear in the **Summary** page, make sure it has the following attributes, in accordance with the OTel semantic conventions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Response time
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Throughput
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Error rate
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * `otel.status_code = ERROR`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Instances pane
      </td>

      <td>
        `service.instance.id` (usually set via the OTel resource API)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
