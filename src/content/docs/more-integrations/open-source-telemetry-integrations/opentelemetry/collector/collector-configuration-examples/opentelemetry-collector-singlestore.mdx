This guide explains how to collect metrics from your SingleStore deployment using the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector gathers, processes, and sends telemetry data (including metrics, logs, and traces) to various observability backends, including New Relic.

The setup example below leverages the Prometheus receiver within the collector. It retrieves service metrics directly from [SingleStore's management API](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/management-api/reference/) and exports them to New Relic's OpenTelemetry endpoint.

Follow the steps below to collect and export SingleStore metrics to New Relic.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Review the requirements [#requirements]

      Before you start, you'll need the following:
     
      * A running Docker daemon service
      * An installed [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool
      * Your [SingleStore API key](https://support.singlestore.com/hc/en-us/articles/12396018910228-Creating-Management-API-Key) 
      * Your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the account you want to report data to

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Download or clone the example configuration [#download]

        1. [Download the example Configuration](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples).
        2. Once downloaded, locate the `singlestore` directory within the `other-examples/collector` folder of the repository. This directory contains the specific configuration for collecting SingleStore metrics.
        3. (Optional) Refer to the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/blob/main/other-examples/collector/singlestore/README.md) for additional details and instructions related to the SingleStore example.

    </Step>

    <Step>
      ##  Set environment variables and run the collector [#set-variables-run-collector]
      
      In the `.env` file:
        * Set the SingleStore API key, workspace group, and Org variables
        * Set the New Relic API key variable to your New Relic license key
      
      Once the variables are set, you can run the example by using the following command:

```bash
  # Open the SingleStore example directory
  cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/other-examples/collector/singlestore

  # run the collector in docker
  docker compose up
```

      ### Environment variable information
      
      If you need more information on the environment variables set above, see the documentation in the following table.
