You can collect metrics about your Docker containers with the OpenTelemetry collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

You can view this [metric data](#data) in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts.

Complete the steps below to collect metrics from docker containers:

## Step 1: Sign up for your free account if you haven't already [#signup]

<InlineSignup />

## Step 2: Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

The collector will use the [dockerstats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver) component (minimum version recommended v0.81.0), and it requires access to the docker daemon through an endpoint:

* By default `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` endpoint is used. Therefore, the collector should be executed with a user able to read the docker socket.

## Step 3: Install Opentelemetry collector [#install-opentelemetry-collector]

Download and install the Opentelemetry collector following [Opentelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/).

You will need to install [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib Distro](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib) or other distribution including, at least, the following components:

* [Dockerstats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver)
* [OTLP exporter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter)
* [Resource processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourceprocessor/README.md)
* [Resource detection processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md)

## Step 4: Configure Opentelemetry collector [#configure-opentelemetry-collector]

Update or create a new file called `config.yaml` from the example below.

Replace the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` in the file with your own values. For more info, see the [New Relic License key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key).

```yaml
receivers:

  docker_stats:
    metrics:
      container.cpu.usage.total:
        enabled: true
      container.cpu.throttling_data.periods:
        enabled: true
      container.cpu.throttling_data.throttled_periods:
        enabled: true
      # `container.cpu.percent` is deprecated in favor of `container.cpu.utilization` in opentelemetry-collector-contrib v0.79.0
      container.cpu.utilization:
        enabled: true
      container.cpu.percent:
        enabled: false
      container.memory.usage.limit:
        enabled: true
      container.memory.usage.total:
        enabled: true
      container.memory.percent:
        enabled: true
      container.blockio.io_service_bytes_recursive:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_bytes:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_bytes:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_dropped:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_dropped:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_errors:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_errors:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_packets:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_packets:
        enabled: true
      container.pids.count:
        enabled: true

processors:

  # resource and resource-detection processors allow decorating the metrics with host attributes
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: host.id
        from_attribute: host.name
        action: insert

  resourcedetection:
    detectors: ["env", "system"]

  resourcedetection/cloud:
    detectors: ["gcp", "ec2", "azure"]
    timeout: 2s
    override: false

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:443
    headers:
      api-key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY

service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [docker_stats]
      processors:
        - resourcedetection
        - resourcedetection/cloud
        - resource
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For further configuration options, please review:
* [Dockerstats receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver#configuration)
* [Opentelemetry Collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)
* [Batch processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/batchprocessor/README.md)

## Step 4: Run the collector [#run-collector]

Run the Opentelemetry collector (the way to run it may vary depending on the chosen installation method). Example:

```yaml
/usr/bin/otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

## Step 5: Find and use your data

### Browse containers data in infrastructure UI [#using-ui]

By using the recommended configuration for the Docker receiver, you can explore [containers](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/hosts-new-view/#containers) running on a host in the new [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities#access-new-ui) (New Host UI) experience.

### Take advantage of our entities driven experiences

The container's telemetry data originating from the Open Telemetry Docker receiver generates container entities.
[Entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) are anything that reports data to New Relic and is identified by an unique entity ID.

Your monitored entities are the drivers of features like Entity Explorer, Workloads, and Lookout.
Check this [document](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) for more information on how to get benefited from these experiences.

### Explore and query your data [#data]

You may use the [metrics explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer) to check the metrics being ingested. All metrics reported by the docker stats receiver start by the `"container."` prefix.

The following NRQL queries show examples to help you query the metrics you received:

* Listing number of metric updates ingested by metric name:

  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName LIKE 'container.%' and instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry' LIMIT max
  ```

* Querying a specific metric faceted by host:

  ```sql
    SELECT average(container.cpu.percent) FROM Metric WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry' FACET host.name TIMESERIES
  ```

* Listing dimensions available for a given metric:

  ```sql
  SELECT keyset() FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'container.cpu.percent'
  ```

### Install quickstart [#quickstart]

Take advantage of the Docker dashboard included in the [Docker Open Telemetry Quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/docker-otel) to easily monitor your Docker infrastructure thanks to the predefined graphs and filters.

### Metric data

For a list of all the supported metrics, please refer to [the dockerstats receiver metrics reference](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver/documentation.md).
