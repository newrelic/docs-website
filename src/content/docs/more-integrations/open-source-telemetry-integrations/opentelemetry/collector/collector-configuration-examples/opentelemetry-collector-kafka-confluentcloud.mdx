metaDescription: You can collect Kafka metrics from Confluent using the OpenTelemetry collector.
---
You can collect metrics about your Confluent Cloud-managed Kafka deployment with the OpenTelemetry collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability back-end).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're looking for help with other collector use cases, see the [newrelic-opentelemetry-examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples) repository.
</Callout>

Complete the steps below to collect Kafka metrics from Confluent.

## Step 1: Sign up for New Relic! [#signup]

* If you haven't already done so, sign up for a free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).
* Get the <LicenseKey/>for the New Relic account to which you want to report data.

## Step 2: Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* Ensure [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) is installed before proceeding.
* Set [GOPATH](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) to `$GOPATH/bin` and add to the PATH variable.

## Step 3: Compile from PR source repo [#compile]

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic supports the OpenTelemetry community by contributing our work upstream to both the [Core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) and [Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) repos.

  When [PR14167](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/14167) on the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) has been merged, the documentation below will be updated to reflect the main branch of the Contrib repo.
</Callout>

See [https://github.com/abeach-nr/opentelemetry-collector-contrib.git](https://github.com/abeach-nr/opentelemetry-collector-contrib.git) for latest installation instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abeach-nr/opentelemetry-collector-contrib.git
cd opentelemetry-collector-contrib
make otelcontribcol

```

The binary will be installed under `./bin`

## Step 4: Configure Opentelemetry collectors [#configure-opentelemetry-collectors]

Create a new file called `config.yaml` from the example below.

Replace the following keys in the file with your own values:

* [Cloud API key](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/metrics-api.html#metrics-quick-start)
	* CONFLUENT_API_ID
	* CONFLUENT_API_SECRET
* [Kafka Client API key](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/authenticate/api-keys/api-keys.html#resource-specific-api-keys)
	* CLUSTER_API_KEY
	* CLUSTER_API_SECRET
* [New Relic Ingest key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key)
	* NEW RELIC LICENSE KEY
* CLUSTER_ID
	* Cluster ID from Confluent cloud
	* Cluster key/secret should be specific to this cluster
* CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER
  * bootstrap server provided by confluent for the cluster
  * example: xxx-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.confluent.cloud:9092

```yaml
receivers:
  kafkametrics:
    brokers:
      - CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER
    protocol_version: 2.0.0
    scrapers:
      - brokers
      - topics
      - consumers
    auth:
      sasl:
        username: CLUSTER_API_KEY
        password: CLUSTER_API_SECRET
        mechanism: PLAIN
      tls:
        insecure_skip_verify: false
    collection_interval: 30s


  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: "confluent"
          scrape_interval: 60s # Do not go any lower than this or you'll hit rate limits
          static_configs:

          scheme: https
          basic_auth:

          params:
            "resource.kafka.id":
              - CLUSTER_ID
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
    headers:
      api-key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
processors:
  batch:
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 400
    spike_limit_mib: 100
    check_interval: 5s
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics/kafka:
      receivers: [kafkametrics]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]


```

## Step 5: Run the collector [#run-collector]

Execute the following, making sure to insert the operating system (for example, `darwin` or `linux`):

```
./bin/otelcontribcol_INSERT_THE_OPERATING_SYSTEM_amd64 --config config.yaml
```


## Step 6: Set up dashboards in New Relic

Check out this New Relic [example dashboard](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/dashboards/confluent-cloud/confluent-cloud.json) that uses these metrics:
