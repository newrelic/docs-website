metaDescription: You can collect Prometheus metrics using the OpenTelemetry collector.
---
You can collect metrics from any [software that exposes Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) with the OpenTelemetry collector by using the community [Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver). The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

Complete the steps below to collect Prometheus metrics:

## Step 1: Sign up for your free account if you haven't already [#signup]

## Step 2: Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

The collector will use the Prometheus receiver component 

Depending on the software you want to monitor the prerequites may change. Prometheus metrics endpoint could be enabled by defaut or may need some setup in the configuration to enable it.
Others software can require a [third-party Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#third-party-exporters) to expose metrics.

In both cases the Prometheus metrics endpoint needs to be accesible from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Step 3: Install Opentelemetry collector [#install-opentelemetry-collector]

If not done yet, download and install the Opentelemetry collector following [Opentelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/).

Download and install the Opentelemetry collector following [Opentelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/).

You will need to install [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib Distro](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib) or other distribution including, at least, the following components:

* [Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver)
* [OTLP exporter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter)

## Step 4: Configure Opentelemetry collector [#configure-opentelemetry-collector]

Update or create a new file called `config.yaml` from the example below.

Replace the following keys in the file with your own values:

* Prometheus scrape config:
    * `PROMETHEUS_JOBNAME`
    * `PROMETHEUS_HOSTNAME`  
    * `PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PORT`
    * `PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PATH`  (optional, default is /metrics)
* [New Relic License key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key):
	* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: "PROMETHEUS_JOBNAME"
          static_configs:
            - targets: [ "PROMETHEUS_HOSTNAME:PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PORT" ]
              labels:
                label_example: VALUE_EXAMPLE
          metrics_path: PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PATH

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
    headers:
      api-key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
processors:
  batch:
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 400
    spike_limit_mib: 100
    check_interval: 5s
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch, memory_limiter]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For further configuration options, please review:

* [Opentelemetry Collector docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).
* [Prometheus configuration docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) for additional configuration details.
* [Scrape config doc](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).

## Step 4: Run the collector [#run-collector]

Run the Opentelemetry collector (the way to run it may vary depending on the chosen installation method). Example:

```yaml
/usr/bin/otelcol --config ./config.yaml
```

## Step 5: Find and use your data

### Explore your data

You may use the [metrics explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer) to check the metrics being ingested. All metrics reported by the OTEL Prometheus receiver can be detected by running the following query.

```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry' and otel.library.name='otelcol/prometheusreceiver' 
FACET metricName 
```

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

  <Collapser
    id="prometheus-metrics-normalization"
    title="Metrics names don't match"
  >

  Prometheus metrics based dashboards and entities use Prometheus metrics naming conventions to match the metrics being reported by the Prometheus endpoints. However, the OpenTelemetry Prometheus receiver uses OpenTelemetry naming conventions by default after [v076.3](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.76.3).

  To use Prometheus metrics naming conventions, disable the `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` `feature-gate` when running the OpenTelemetry collector:

  ```shell
  otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml --feature-gates=-pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName
  ```
