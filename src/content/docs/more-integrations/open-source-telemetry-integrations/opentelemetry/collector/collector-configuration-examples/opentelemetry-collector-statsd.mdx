metaDescription: You can collect StatsD metrics using the OpenTelemetry collector.

You can collect StatsD metrics with the OpenTelemetry collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

Complete the steps below to collect StatsD metrics:

## Step 1: Sign up for your free account if you haven't already [#signup]

<InlineSignup />

## Step 2: Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

The collector will use the [StatsD receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/statsdreceiver) component. It requires permission to listen on the configured endpoint (`localhost:8125` by default).

## Step 3: Install OpenTelemetry collector [#install-opentelemetry-collector]

Download and install the OpenTelemetry collector following the [OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/).

You will need to install [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib Distro](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib) or other distribution including, at least, these components:

* [StatsD receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/statsdreceiver)
* [OTLP exporter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter)

## Step 4: Configure OpenTelemetry collector [#configure-opentelemetry-collector]

Update or create a new file called `config.yaml` from the example below.

Replace the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` in the file with your own values. For more info, see the [New Relic License key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key).

```yaml
receivers:

  statsd:
    is_monotonic_counter: true

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:443
    headers:
      api-key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY

service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [statsd]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For further configuration options, please review:
* [StatsD receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/statsdreceiver#configuration)
* [OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)

## Step 4: Run the collector [#run-collector]

Run the OpenTelemetry collector (the way to run it may vary depending on the chosen installation method). Example:

```yaml
/usr/bin/otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

## Step 5: Find and use your data

### Explore and query your data [#data]

The collector will report the metrics ingested using StatsD messages, please review:

- [StatsD metric types](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md)
- [StatsD receiver aggregation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/statsdreceiver#aggregation)

You can list the metrics being reported by the statsd receiver:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE otel.library.name = 'otelcol/statsdreceiver' LIMIT MAX
  ```

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="counters-not-reported"
    title="Counter metrics are not reported"
  >
  The counter metrics collected by the statsd receiver are reported as [non-monotonic Sums with delta aggregation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#sums) by default,
  but this metric type is not supported (check [OpenTelemetry metrics best practices for details](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-metrics/#delta-sums)).

  Use the `is_monotonic_counter` configuration option to report counter metrics as monotonic Sums. Example:

  ```yaml
  # ...
  receivers:
    statsd:
      is_monotonic_counter: true
  # ...
  ```

  <Collapser
    id="metrics-aggregation-issue"
    title="Metrics aren't aggregated as expected"
  >
  On specific scenarios, depending on how the StatsD metrics are reported to the receiver and what attributes those metrics include, the aggregation may not work as expected.
  The issue has already been identified and reported in the receiver's OTEL repository. For more information and keep track of the issue, click [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/23809).
