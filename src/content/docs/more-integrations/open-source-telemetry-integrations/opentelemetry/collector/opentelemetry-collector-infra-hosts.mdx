metaDescription: The OpenTelemetry Collector is a central tool to collect, process, and export your telemetry.
---

You can collect metrics and logs from your infrastructure hosts with OpenTelemetry and leverage the same infrastructure experiences that are available for New Relic agents.
Specific receivers and processors are required in the OTel collector to collect and report host telemetry.

If you're looking for help with other collector use cases, see the [newrelic-opentelemetry-examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples) repository.

## Step 1: Prerequisites [#prereqs]

Make sure you've completed the following before going further:

* If you haven't already done so, sign up for a free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).
* Get the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the New Relic account to which you want to report data.

## Step 2: Install the OpenTelemetry Collector [#install-generic]

To do a basic installation for single hosts in the cloud or on-premises, see [OpenTelemetry's instructions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#linux-packaging) for up-to-date installation steps from the community. Instructions are available for the following:

* Linux: Debian systems
* Linux: Red Hat
* Windows
* Docker, Kubernetes, and other options

Your deployment experience might vary depending on which vendor-specific distributions you use. For example, installation via a package manager might be available for Linux hosts.

<Callout variant="important">
  To set up infrastructure monitoring, you need to install and configure components that are included in the `collector-contrib` release. For example, the host receiver is required to collect basic host metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network stats and is only available in the [OpenTelemetry Collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) release.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Configure host metrics and logs [#host-receiver]

This collector example is meant to serve as a starting point from which you can extend, customize, and validate configurations before using them in production.

The `collector-contrib` release includes:
* The `hostreceiver` that generates metrics about the system scraped from various sources. Deploy the collector as an agent when you use a `hostreceiver`.
* The `filelogreceiver` that tails and parses logs from files.

When using the host receiver as part of the collector configuration, New Relic automatically detects host metrics as part of a `Host` entity and will synthesize its golden metrics providing the same experience as with the New Relic infrastructure agent. The following are the configuration requirements to enable the `Host` entity experience in New Relic UI:

* `host.id` attribute is present in host metrics.
* `service.name` and `container.id` attributes are not present in host metrics.

Learn more about available metrics and advanced configurations from the [OpenTelemetry documentation in GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver).

Here is a sample configuration YAML file for a linux host. Be sure to do the following:

* Replace `OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE` with the appropriate [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/#review-settings).
* Replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
* Adjust the target log files in the filelog receiver section based on your requirements.
* Adjust the `memory_limiter` default values based on your environment requirements.

## Step 4: View your data [#view-data]

You can view your collector data in a variety of places in the New Relic UI.

### Browse host data in infrastructure UI [#using-ui]

By using the recommended configuration in the collector, you can view data through the standard features in the [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-ui-overview) experience.

### Query host metrics and logs [#query-host-metrics]

Once telemetry is successfully ingested in New Relic, they are available in [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer) and [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).

The following NRQL queries show examples to help you explore the metrics you received:

* Listing number of metric updates ingested by metric name

  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName LIKE 'system.%' FACET metricName LIMIT max
  ```

* Querying specific metrics faceted by host

  ```sql
  SELECT average(system.disk.operations) FROM Metric FACET host.name TIMESERIES
  ```

* Listing dimensions available for a given metric

  ```sql
  SELECT keyset() FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'system.disk.operations'
  ```

* Querying number of log events per host
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM Log FACET host.name TIMESERIES
  ```
