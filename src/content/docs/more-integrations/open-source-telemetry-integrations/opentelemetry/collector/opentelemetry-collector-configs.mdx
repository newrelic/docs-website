metaDescription: Here are some general configurations for your collector.
---

A variety of general configurations are available for your collector setup.

### Health check [#health-check]

The health check is an extension to the primary functionality of the collector and ensures the collector is working.

For setup details, see [health_check (GitHub)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#health-check)

When enabled, the local endpoint using localhost:13133 returns the following response:

```json
{
  "status": "Server available",
  "upSince": "2015-10-21T12:00:00.6847174Z",
  "uptime": "50.0123456s"
}
```

### Environment variables [#env-variables]

The collector configuration supports the use and expansion of environment variables. For example:

```yaml
processors:
  attributes/example:
    actions:
      - key: "${DB_KEY}"
        action: "${OPERATION}"
```

### Proxy support [#proxy-support]

Exporters that leverage the net/http package respect the following proxy environment variables:

* `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`
* `NO_PROXY`

If these environment variables are set when the collector starts, then exporters, regardless of protocol, will or will not proxy traffic.

### Authentication [#authentication]

Most `receivers` exposing an HTTP or gRPC port can be protected using the collectorâ€™s [authentication mechanism](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#authentication), and most `exporters` using HTTP or gRPC clients can add authentication data to the outgoing requests.

For a list of known authenticators, use the [Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/?s=authenticator&component=extension&language=) available in the OpenTelemetry website.
