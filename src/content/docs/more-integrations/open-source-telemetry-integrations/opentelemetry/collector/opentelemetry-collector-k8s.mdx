metaDescription: You can use the OpenTelemetry Collector to monitor your Kubernetes clusters.

If you already have apps instrumented with OpenTelemetry in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use an OpenTelemetry Collector to enhance your current telemetry with metadata about Kubernetes. This can help you see the effects of Kubernetes on your apps. For example, tracing spans will show which Kubernetes cluster, node, pod, and container are involved.

You can find more details about how to do this in [Link OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-otel-applications-kubernetes).

If you're looking for help with other collector use cases, see the [newrelic-opentelemetry-examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples) repository.
