If you need guidance implementing OpenTelemetry with New Relic, this reference architecture should help your software developers, DevOps, enterprise architects, and technology managers collaborate on the project. It is a template showing a bird's-eye view of common ways to implement OpenTelemetry with New Relic.

The diagram shows an implementation that ingests telemetry from OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Jaeger, and a New Relic <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent. The three services (A, B, and C) are instrumented to send metrics, traces, and logs.

For data collected by OpenTelemetry, you can either send it directly to New Relic via the OTLP endpoint, or you can send it first to an optional OpenTelemetry Collector. If you use the collector, it aggregates and enhances data pipelines before the telemetry is sent over to backends (Kafka for data analytics and New Relic for end-to-end observability).
