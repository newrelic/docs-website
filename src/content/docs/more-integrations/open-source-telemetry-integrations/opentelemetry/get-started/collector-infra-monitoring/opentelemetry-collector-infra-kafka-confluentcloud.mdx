You can collect metrics about your Confluent Cloud-managed Kafka deployment with the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

This integration works by running a prometheus receiver configuration inside the OpenTelemetry collector, which scrapes [Confluent Cloud's metrics API](https://api.telemetry.confluent.cloud/docs/descriptors/datasets/cloud?_ga=2.183807142.1264186867.1705940186-6520871.1686857317&_gl=1*1te8jue*_ga*NjUyMDg3MS4xNjg2ODU3MzE3*_ga_D2D3EGKSGD*MTcwNjAzNzYwOS41Ni4wLjE3MDYwMzc2MDkuNjAuMC4w) and exports that data to New Relic.

Complete the steps below to collect Kafka metrics from Confluent and export them to New Relic.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Make sure you're set up

      Before you start, you need to have the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the account you want to report data to. You should also verify that:

      * You have a docker daemon running
      * You have [Docker Compose](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/other-examples/collector/confluentcloud) installed
      * You have a [Confluent Cloud account](https://www.confluent.io/get-started/)
      * You have your [Confluent Cloud API key & secret](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/api-key/confluent_api-key_create.html) available

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Download or clone the example repos

        Download [New Relic's OpenTelemetry Examples repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples) as this setup uses its example collector configuration. Once installed, open the [Confluent Cloud example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/other-examples/collector/confluentcloud) directory. For more information, you can check the `README` there as well.

    </Step>

    <Step>
      ##  Set environment variables and run the collector
      * Set the API key & Secret variables for both Confluent Cloud and New relic in the `.env` file
      * Set the `Cluster_ID` variable with the target kafka cluster ID
      * (Optional) To monitor connectors or schema registry's managed by Confluent Cloud, you can un-comment the configuration in the `collector.yaml` file and set the corresponding ID in the `.env` file

```bash
# Open the confluent cloud example directory
cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/other-examples/collector/confluentcloud

# Set environment variables.

# run the collector in docker
docker compose up
```

       ## View your data in New Relic

      You can view your Confluent Cloud data in a few different ways.

      * Navigate to the [New Relic marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) and search for `Confluent`. The available dashboards can be installed right onto your account!
      * Navigate to the metrics explorer and filter for `confluent_kafka`. This data can be added to any custom alert or dashboard.
