You can collect metrics about your Confluent Cloud-managed Kafka deployment with the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

This integration works by running a Prometheus receiver configuration inside the OpenTelemetry collector, which scrapes [Confluent Cloud's metrics API](https://api.telemetry.confluent.cloud/docs/descriptors/datasets/cloud?_ga=2.183807142.1264186867.1705940186-6520871.1686857317&_gl=1*1te8jue*_ga*NjUyMDg3MS4xNjg2ODU3MzE3*_ga_D2D3EGKSGD*MTcwNjAzNzYwOS41Ni4wLjE3MDYwMzc2MDkuNjAuMC4w) and exports that data to New Relic.

Complete the steps below to collect Kafka metrics from Confluent and export them to New Relic.

        ## Make sure you're set up

      Before you start, you need to have the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the account you want to report data to. You should also verify that:

      * You have a Kubernetes cluster running
      * (for Helm users) make sure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) installed
      * You have a [Confluent Cloud account](https://www.confluent.io/get-started/) with a cluster running
      * You have your [Confluent Cloud API key & secret](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/api-key/confluent_api-key_create.html) available

    </Step>
    <Step>
       ## Download or clone the OTeL tech partner examples repo

        Download [New Relic's OpenTelemetry tech partnership Examples repo](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/tech-partner-opentelemetry-integrations) as this setup uses its example collector configuration. Once installed, open the [Confluent Cloud example](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/tech-partner-opentelemetry-integrations/confluent-cloud) directory. For more information, you can check the `README` there as well.

    </Step>
    <Step>
      ##  Run the Helm example

      From the `./confluent-cloud/helm` directory, update the variables in the `values.yaml` accordingly. For more information on the individual variables, reference the Local Variable Information table below.

      Next, run the collector by using the following command
    ```bash
    # Open the confluent cloud helm example directory
    cd ./confluent-cloud/helm

    # Make sure to set environment variables.

    # Install and run helm
    helm install ./helm
    ```
    ## Run the Kubernetes example

    From the `./confluent-cloud/k8s` directory, update the variables in the in the `./k8s/deployment.yaml` file. For more information on the individual variables, reference the Local Variable Information table below.

    Once the variables are set, run the following command to apply the collector to your Kubernetes cluster.

    ```bash
    # Open the Confluent Cloud k8s example directory
    cd ./confluent-cloud/k8s

    # Make sure to set environment variables

    # Apply the collector to the cluster
    kubectl apply -f ./k8s
    ```

       ## View your data in New Relic

      You can view your Confluent Cloud data in a few different ways.

      * Navigate to the [New Relic marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) and search for `Confluent`. The available dashboards can be installed right onto your account!
      * Navigate to the metrics explorer and filter for `confluent_kafka`. This data can be added to any custom alert or dashboard.
