Try out these Java tutorials to see what the New Relic platform can do with your OTLP data. We have three tutorials you can choose from, each one using the same demo Spring app. The app will calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence and generate traces, metrics, and logs.

By working through these tutorials, you can learn skills to help you set up your own app with OpenTelemetry and New Relic.

## Requirements [#requirements]

To get started, make sure you have the following:

* A New Relic account: Sign up for a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) if you don't already have one.
* Java 17 or higher: If you don't already have this, see [these download options](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

## Tutorials [#tutorials]

While each tutorial uses the same demo app, they have different approaches to help you become acquainted with OpenTelemetry and New Relic.
* **Pre-instrumented app**: Run our pre-instrumented demo app for a quick way to see data in our UI.
* **OpenTelemetry Java agent**: Monitor our demo app with the OpenTelemetry Java agent.
* **Manual setup**: Instrument our demo app manually.

Click on the tab below for the tutorial you want to complete.

<Callout variant="tip">
When using OpenTelemetry, you'll have two choices for exporting data from your application to New Relic via OTLP:
* Directly from your app to New Relic
* Your app sends data to an OpenTelemetry Collector where it is then exported to New Relic

These tutorials cover the first option. If you want to export your data via a collector, check out this [collector documentation](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic/) for details.

### Run the pre-instrumented demo app [#pre-instrum]

This is a great option if you want us to do the instrumentation so you can quickly see what it's like to send data to New Relic and view it in our UI.

1. In your terminal, run the following to clone the demo app and navigate to the Getting Started Guides' `java` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/java
    ```
2. Set these two environment variables to send data to your New Relic account:
    * Make sure to use your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
    * If your New Relic data center region is EU and not US, set the endpoint to: `https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net`

      * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=INSERT_YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
      * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net`
      * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf`
3. Set the first environment variable below to name the service, then set the second for the service instance ID, which activates certain platform features. Finally, enable logs since logging is off by default:
      * `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=getting-started-java`
      * `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.instance.id=INSERT_YOUR_ID_HERE`
        * Replace `INSERT_YOUR_OWN_ID_HERE` with a unique instance id. For example, you could use 1234.
      * `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp`
4. In the same `getting-started-guides/java` directory, build and run the application:
      * macOS:
        ```bash
        ./gradlew bootRun
        ```

      * PowerShell:
        ```bash
        .\gradlew.bat build
        ```
5. Open a new terminal tab, switch to the `getting-started-guides/java/Instrumented` directory, and run the following command to generate some traffic to the application:
        * macOS:
          ```bash
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```bash
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

6. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services**.
7. Click your new entity (service) called `getting-started-java` and explore the UI. For more tips about what to look for in the UI, see [View your data in New Relic](#view-data).
8. When you're finished looking at your data in the UI, shut down the application by pressing CONTROL+C in both terminal sessions.

### Monitor the demo app with the OpenTelemetry Java agent [#java-agent]

Here's a different tutorial that also uses the same demo app. In this case, you'll use the OpenTelemetry Java agent to automatically monitor the demo app. You don't need to modify the Java source code. By using the agent, you can quickly start exporting sample data to New Relic.

The auto-instrumentation agent is a JAR file that dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from popular libraries and frameworks. You can also use it to capture data such as inbound requests, outbound HTTP calls, and database calls. It can be attached to any Java 8+ application.

<Callout variant="tip">
  See the [official Java agent documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/) for additional configuration options.
</Callout>

To monitor our demo app with the OpenTelemetry Java agent:

1. Download the [agent JAR file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar), which contains the agent and instrumentation libraries. Place it in your preferred directory and note the path, which you will use later.
2. If you haven't already done so, download the demo application repository and switch to the following directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/java
    ```
3. Build the demo app with this command:
   * macOS:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
   * PowerShell:
    ```bash
    .\gradlew.bat build
    ```
    <Callout variant="tip">
      After a successful build, you will find the resulting application JAR file in `Uninstrumented/build/libs`, called `uninstrumented.jar`.
    </Callout>

4. Go to our [environment variables reference section](#ref-env-vars) below to see which variables you need to export and then return to these steps.

5. Continue in `getting-started-guides/java/Uninstrumented` to launch the agent with the app:

    <Callout variant="important">
      Replace `path/to` with the location of the JAR file you downloaded earlier.
    </Callout>
      ```bash
      java -javaagent:path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
           -jar ./build/libs/uninstrumented.jar
      ```
6. Generate traffic to the application by opening a new terminal in the `getting-started-guides/java/Uninstrumented` directory and running the load generator:
        * macOS:
          ```bash
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```bash
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

7. Now that you've sent some data to New Relic, see our [instructions on viewing the data in the UI](#view-data).

8. When you're finished looking at your data in the UI, shut down the application by pressing CONTROL+C in both terminal sessions.

### Set up the demo app manually [#manual-instrum]

In this track, you'll roll up your sleeves and tinker with the engine of the car. This is the approach to take if you want to have the most control over what telemetry is reported and want to see details about how it's done.

You'll manually insert instrumentation into our demo app to capture telemetry, and you'll configure the SDK to export that data to New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
  While you can manually configure the SDK, we will show you how to configure the SDK using the [autoconfigure option](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure), which simplifies the the process by using environment variables and system properties.
</Callout>

        <Steps>
        <Step>
#### Download the demo application [#download]

If you haven't already downloaded our demo app, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
```
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Install dependencies [#dependencies]

To add dependencies:

1. Go to the application directory.
    ```bash
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/java/uninstrumented
    ```
2. Open `build.gradle`.
3. Add the following highlighted items to the `dependencies` block (you may need to scroll down inside the code block):
    ```gradle lineHighlight=29-42
    plugins {
        id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.7.5'
        id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.0'
        id 'java'
    }

    java {
        toolchain {
            languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)
        }
    }

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    bootRun {
        mainClass.set 'com.example.demo.Application'
    }

    configurations.all {
        exclude module: 'spring-boot-starter-logging'
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
        implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-log4j2'

        // OpenTelemetry core
        implementation platform('io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-bom:1.22.0')
        implementation platform('io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-bom-alpha:1.22.0-alpha')
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-logs'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure'

        // OpenTelemetry instrumentation
        implementation platform('io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-bom-alpha:1.22.1-alpha')
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-runtime-metrics'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-log4j-appender-2.17'
        implementation 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-spring-webmvc-6.0'
    }
    ```

Notes:

* The `bom` (bill of materials) dependencies are used to synchronize versions of dependencies for a particular ecosystem. Since OpenTelemetry publishes a lot of Java components, these help ensure that all the versions are synchronized, whether you use just a few or a lot of them.
* The remaining dependencies provide access to the SDK, API, OTLP exporter, and instrumentation libraries.
* There is an additional configuration to exclude the spring-boot-starter-logging module. This prevents a build error message relating to `log4j-slf4j-impl cannot be present with log4j-to-slf4j`.
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Configure the SDK with the autoconfigure extension [#auto-config-ext]

While you can configure the SDK manually, we recommend you use the autoconfigure extension since it streamlines the process.

1. Go to the app's source code directory:
    ```bash
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/java/uninstrumented/src/main/java/com/example/demo
    ```
2. Open `Application.java`.
3. Insert the highlighted lines:
    ```java lineHighlight=7-12,17-20
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class Application {

        private static volatile OpenTelemetry openTelemetry = OpenTelemetry.noop();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Build the SDK auto-configuration extension module
            OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetrySdk = AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
                    .setResultAsGlobal(false)
                    .build()
                    .getOpenTelemetrySdk();
            Application.openTelemetry = openTelemetrySdk;

            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }

        @Bean
        public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {
            return openTelemetry;
        }
    }
    ```
4. Go to our [environment variables reference section](#ref-env-vars) below to see which variables you need to export and then return to these steps.
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Add instrumentation libraries: traces [#library-traces]

In `Application.java`, add the highlighted instrumentation for Spring Web MVC by registering a tracing filter:

```java lineHighlight=22-26
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    private static volatile OpenTelemetry openTelemetry = OpenTelemetry.noop();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build the SDK auto-configuration extension module
        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetrySdk = AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
                .setResultAsGlobal(false)
                .build()
                .getOpenTelemetrySdk();
        Application.openTelemetry = openTelemetrySdk;

        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {
        return openTelemetry;
    }

    // Add Spring WebMVC instrumentation by registering a tracing filter
    @Bean
    public Filter webMvcTracingFilter(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
        return SpringWebMvcTelemetry.create(openTelemetry).createServletFilter();
    }
}
```
        </Step>
        <Step>

#### Add instrumentation libraries: metrics [#library-metrics]

Generate and collect metrics about your Java runtime by registering the following in the `Application.java` file. Insert the highlighted lines below:

```java lineHighlight=14-20
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    private static volatile OpenTelemetry openTelemetry = OpenTelemetry.noop();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build the SDK auto-configuration extension module
        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetrySdk = AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
                .setResultAsGlobal(false)
                .build()
                .getOpenTelemetrySdk();
        Application.openTelemetry = openTelemetrySdk;

        // Register runtime metrics instrumentation
        BufferPools.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
        Classes.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
        Cpu.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
        GarbageCollector.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
        MemoryPools.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
        Threads.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);

        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {
        return openTelemetry;
    }

    // Add Spring WebMVC instrumentation by registering a tracing filter
    @Bean
    public Filter webMvcTracingFilter(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
        return SpringWebMvcTelemetry.create(openTelemetry).createServletFilter();
    }
}
```
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Add instrumentation libraries: logs [#library-logs]

This demo application is configured to use the `OpenTelemetryAppender` (via `log4j.xml`), which uses `GlobalLoggerProvider`. Setting `GlobalLoggerProvider` wires up the `OpenTelemetryAppender` to the Log SDK that is configured using autoconfigure here:

1. Open `Application.java`.
2. Insert the following highlighted lines.
        ```java lineHighlight=14-15
        @SpringBootApplication
        public class Application {

            private static volatile OpenTelemetry openTelemetry = OpenTelemetry.noop();

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Build the SDK auto-configuration extension module
                OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetrySdk = AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
                        .setResultAsGlobal(false)
                        .build()
                        .getOpenTelemetrySdk();
                Application.openTelemetry = openTelemetrySdk;

                // Set GlobalLoggerProvider, which is used by Log4j2 appender
                GlobalLoggerProvider.set(openTelemetrySdk.getSdkLoggerProvider());

                // Register runtime metrics instrumentation
                BufferPools.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
                Classes.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
                Cpu.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
                GarbageCollector.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
                MemoryPools.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);
                Threads.registerObservers(openTelemetrySdk);

                SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
            }

            @Bean
            public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {
                return openTelemetry;
            }

            // Add Spring WebMVC instrumentation by registering a tracing filter
            @Bean
            public Filter webMvcTracingFilter(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
                return SpringWebMvcTelemetry.create(openTelemetry).createServletFilter();
            }
        }
        ```

3. Create a directory called `resources` in `Uninstrumented/src/main`.
4. In this new directory, create a file called `log4j2.xml` with the following contents:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <Configuration status="WARN" packages="io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.log4j.appender.v2_17">
          <Appenders>
            <Console name="ConsoleAppender" target="SYSTEM_OUT" follow="true">
              <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
            </Console>
            <OpenTelemetry name="OpenTelemetryAppender" />
          </Appenders>
          <Loggers>
            <Root level="info">
              <AppenderRef ref="OpenTelemetryAppender" />
              <AppenderRef ref="ConsoleAppender" />
            </Root>
          </Loggers>
        </Configuration>
        ```
    <Callout variant="tip">
      The `packages=...` section of this line allows Log4J to find and configure the `OpenTelemetryAppender`. The source code is [in the OpenTelemetry repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/log4j/log4j-appender-2.17/library) and was added as a dependency via `io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-log4j-appender-2.17`)
    </Callout>
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Custom trace instrumentation: Create span attribute constants [#custom-attribs]

Each trace is made up of spans, which represent a logical unit of work or an operation within a particular request. The code below demonstrates:

* Static constants to hold attribute keys that can be used to provide request-level insights in your spans
* How to initialize a [Tracer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#tracer), which creates spans

Insert the following highlighted lines into `Controller.java`:

```java lineHighlight=4-14
@RestController
public class Controller {

    // Attribute constants
    private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_N = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.n");
    private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_RESULT = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.result");

    private final Tracer tracer;

    @Autowired
    Controller(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
        // Initialize tracer
        tracer = openTelemetry.getTracer(Controller.class.getName());
    }

    @GetMapping(value = "/fibonacci")
    . . .
}
```
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Custom trace instrumentation: Create a custom span [#cust-span]

You can create whatever spans you want, and it is up to you to annotate your spans with attributes on specific operations. The attributes you set will provide additional context about the specific operation you are tracking, such as results or operation properties.

1. In `Controller.java`, insert these highlighted lines to start a new span called `fibonacci` that does the following:
    * Captures data about the execution of this method
    * Sets an attribute that stores the value of n from the user's request
    ```java lineHighlight=2-3
    private long fibonacci(long n) {
        // Start a new span and set your first attribute
        var span = tracer.spanBuilder("fibonacci").setAttribute(ATTR_N, n).startSpan();
        . . .
    }
    ```
2. Add granular detail into your code by adding an attribute to your span for storing information about successful requests:
    ```java lineHighlight=20-21
    private long fibonacci(long n) {
        // Start a new span and set your first attribute
        var span = tracer.spanBuilder("fibonacci").setAttribute(ATTR_N, n).startSpan();

        try {
            if (n < 1 || n > 90) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be 1 <= n <= 90.");
            }

            long result = 1;
            if (n > 2) {
            long a = 0;
            long b = 1;

            for (long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                result = a + b;
                a = b;
                b = result;
            }
            // Set a span attribute to capture information about successful requests
            span.setAttribute(ATTR_RESULT, last);
            return last;
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw e;
        }
    }
    ```
        </Step>
        <Step>

#### Custom trace instrumentation: Record an exception [#span-exception]

You may want to record exceptions as they happen. We recommend you do this in conjunction with setting the span status. First, set your span as the current span, set the status code to error in the event of an exception, and then end the span:

```java lineHighlight=5-6,26-27,29-32
private long fibonacci(long n) {
    // Start a new span and set your first attribute
    var span = tracer.spanBuilder("fibonacci").setAttribute(ATTR_N, n).startSpan();

    // Set the span as the current span
    try (var scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
        if (n < 1 || n > 90) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be 1 <= n <= 90.");
        }

        long result = 1;
        if (n > 2) {
            long a = 0;
            long b = 1;

            for (long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                result = a + b;
                a = b;
                b = result;
            }
        }
        // Set a span attribute to capture information about successful requests
        span.setAttribute(ATTR_RESULT, result);
        return result;
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // Record the exception and set the span status
        span.recordException(e).setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, e.getMessage());
        throw e;
    } finally {
        // End the span
        span.end();
    }
}
```

This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if a user provides invalid input. When this happens, the exception is recorded as an event on the span and the span's status will be set to `ERROR`. The exception message is captured as the status description. The exception will be recorded as an event on the span where it occurs.

Finally, in `handleException()` in the `ErrorHandler` class, set the status for the span to `ERROR` with these highlighted lines:

```java lineHighlight=10-11
@ControllerAdvice
private static class ErrorHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler({
        IllegalArgumentException.class,
        MissingServletRequestParameterException.class,
        HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException.class
    })
    public ResponseEntity<Object> handleException(Exception e) {
        // Set the span status and description
        Span.current().setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, e.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(Map.of("message", e.getMessage()), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```
As in the previous step, this sets the span's status code if the user inputs an invalid number. However, because this happens in the exception handler, rather than in `fibonacci()`, the current span is the parent span for the request. This parent span comes from the Spring Web MVC instrumentation added via the filter in the Application class. Now, when your application endpoint raises an exception, both the parent span and child span will have a span status of `ERROR`.
        </Step>
        <Step>

#### Custom metric instrumentation: Add a custom metric counter [#metrics-cust]

Metrics are a telemetry data type that are really helpful because they combine individual measurements into aggregations, and produce data that is constant as a function of system load. You can use this data in conjunction with spans to help spot trends and provide application runtime telemetry. You can also annotate any metric with attributes to help describe what subdivision of the measurements the metric represents.

The OpenTelemetry metrics API defines a number of instruments, which record measurements that are aggregated by the metrics SDK and exported out of process. There are two types of instruments:

* Synchronous: These instruments record measurements as they occur
* Asynchronous: These instruments register a callback, which is invoked only once per collection and do not have associated context

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have any questions about the status of metric in the OpenTelemetry project, see the [signal statuses](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/#status-and-releases).
</Callout>

Complete the following to add a custom counter:

1. Instantiate a boolean attribute for your custom metric and initialize a metrics instrument.
    <Callout variant="tip">
      In this case, we are using a [LongCounter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/#metrics), which records only positive values and is useful for counting things, such as the number of bytes sent over a network. By default, counter measurements are aggregated to monotonic (always increasing) sums.
    </Callout>

    ```java lineHighlight=7,10,16-21
    @RestController
    public class Controller {

        // Attribute constants
        private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_N = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.n");
        private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_RESULT = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.result");
        private static final AttributeKey<Boolean> ATTR_VALID_N = AttributeKey.booleanKey("fibonacci.valid.n");

        private final Tracer tracer;
        private final LongCounter fibonacciInvocations;

        @Autowired
        Controller(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
            // Initialize tracer
            tracer = openTelemetry.getTracer(Controller.class.getName());
            // Initialize instrument
            Meter meter = openTelemetry.getMeter(Controller.class.getName());
            fibonacciInvocations = meter
                .counterBuilder("fibonacci.invocations")
                .setDescription("Measures the number of times the fibonacci method is invoked.")
                .build();
        }
        . . .
    }
    ```
2. Insert the following highlighed lines so your custom counter can capture valid and invalid inputs, as well as the number of times each occurs.
    ```java lineHighlight=24-25,30-31
    private long fibonacci(long n) {
        // Start a new span and set your first attribute
        var span = tracer.spanBuilder("fibonacci").setAttribute(ATTR_N, n).startSpan();

        // Set the span as the current span
        try (var scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
            if (n < 1 || n > 90) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be 1 <= n <= 90.");
            }

            long result = 1;
            if (n > 2) {
                long a = 0;
                long b = 1;

                for (long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                    result = a + b;
                    a = b;
                    b = result;
                }
            }
            // Set a span attribute to capture information about successful requests
            span.setAttribute(ATTR_RESULT, result);
            // Counter to increment the number of times a valid input is recorded
            fibonacciInvocations.add(1, Attributes.of(ATTR_VALID_N, true));
            return result;
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // Record the exception and set the span status
            span.recordException(e).setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, e.getMessage());
            // Counter to increment the number of times an invalid input is recorded
            fibonacciInvocations.add(1, Attributes.of(ATTR_VALID_N, false));
            throw e;
        } finally {
            // End the span
            span.end();
        }
    }
    ```
        </Step>
        <Step>
#### Custom log instrumentation [#cust-log]

The status of the logs signal in OpenTelemetry Java is currently [experimental](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/#status-and-releases). Log messages are managed by the root handler in your app, which will send logs of `INFO` level and higher to the console by default. However, you can modify the logger behavior by changing the logging level, including for specific classes, or installing a custom handler or filter.

##### Initialize the logger [#initialize-logger]

As previously stated, this is from the `java.util.logging` library. The Logger is not an OpenTelemetry component, but the application has been configured to send Log4j logs to the OpenTelemetry Log SDK:

```java lineHighlight=4-5
@RestController
public class Controller {

    // Logger (note that this is not an OTel component)
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(Controller.class);

    // Attribute constants
    private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_N = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.n");
    private static final AttributeKey<Long> ATTR_RESULT = AttributeKey.longKey("fibonacci.result");
    private static final AttributeKey<Boolean> ATTR_VALID_N = AttributeKey.booleanKey("fibonacci.valid.n");
    . . .
}
```

##### Add custom log messages [#cust-log-messages]

Once you've initialized the logger, you can use the logger to record:

* The result of a valid input, along with the value of that result
* When no output was recorded

Insert the following highlighted lines:

```java lineHighlight=26-27,34-35
private long fibonacci(long n) {
    // Start a new span and set your first attribute
    var span = tracer.spanBuilder("fibonacci").setAttribute(ATTR_N, n).startSpan();

    // Set the span as the current span
    try (var scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
        if (n < 1 || n > 90) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be 1 <= n <= 90.");
        }

        long result = 1;
        if (n > 2) {
            long a = 0;
            long b = 1;

            for (long i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                result = a + b;
                a = b;
                b = result;
            }
        }
        // Set a span attribute to capture information about successful requests
        span.setAttribute(ATTR_RESULT, result);
        // Counter to increment the number of times a valid input is recorded
        fibonacciInvocations.add(1, Attributes.of(ATTR_VALID_N, true));
        // Log the result of a valid input
        LOGGER.info("Compute fibonacci(" + n + ") = " + result);
        return result;
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // Record the exception and set the span status
        span.recordException(e).setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, e.getMessage());
        // Counter to increment the number of times an invalid input is recorded
        fibonacciInvocations.add(1, Attributes.of(ATTR_VALID_N, false));
        // Log when no output was recorded
        LOGGER.info("Failed to compute fibonacci(" + n + ")");
        throw e;
    } finally {
        // End the span
        span.end();
    }
}
```
        </Step>
        <Step>

#### Exercise the app to generate some traffic [#exercise-app]

You're ready to send some data to New Relic!

1. Go to the directory `getting-started-guides/java`, and build and run the app with this command:
        * macOS:
          ```bash
          ./gradlew bootRun
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```bash
          .\gradlew.bat build
          ```
    <Callout variant="tip">
      If your terminal displays the Spring ASCII, it means your app has successfully built and is running:

      <img
        alt="Screenshot showing Spring Boot ASCII logo"
        title="Screenshot showing Spring Boot ASCII logo"
        src={opentelemetrySpringBootASCIIDisplay}
      />
    </Callout>
2. Generate traffic from the application by opening a new terminal in the `getting-started-guides/java/Uninstrumented` directory and running the load generator:
        * macOS:
          ```bash
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```bash
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

3. Now that you've sent some data to New Relic, see our [instructions on viewing the data in the UI](#view-data).

### Traces [#traces]

Once you've reached the `getting-started-java` entity in New Relic:


1. In the left pane's **Monitor** section, click **Distributed tracing**, and then click the **Fibonacci** trace group.
    <img
      alt="Screenshot showing the main distributed tracing page"
      title="Screenshot showing the main distributed tracing page"
      src={opentelemetryMainDistributedTracingPage}
    />
2. From there, find a trace with an error and click to open it:
    <img
      alt="Screenshot showing an error in distributed tracing"
      title="Screenshot showing an error in distributed tracing"
      src={opentelemetryDistributedTracingError}
    />
3. Once you have the trace open, click `Show in-process spans`, and then click on the resulting span, which will open up a details panel to the right. To see the exception you recorded when a user input is invalid, click on `View span events`:
    <img
      title="Screenshot of in-process spans"
      alt="Screenshot of in-process spans"
      src={opentelemetryInProcessSpans}

To learn more, see our documentation about the [JVMs view](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-jvms-page/).

### Logs [#logs]

Here is where to access your logs:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the main logs page"
  alt="Screenshot showing the main logs page"
  src={opentelemetryMainLogsPage}
/>

You will also see logs in your terminal:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing logs in a terminal"
  alt="Screenshot showing logs in a terminal"
  src={opentelemetryLogsinTerminal}
/>

Back in your logs view, select a log, and you will see a pane open up with the log message and additional attributes that were collected, such as the associated span and trace ids, as well as metadata injected by New Relic:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing log details with trace"
  alt="Screenshot showing log details with trace"
  src={opentelemetryLogDetailsWithTrace}
