metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry logs and New Relic.
---

Logs may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a [log data model](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md) for representing log data.

You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic.

### Send logs to New Relic [#send-logs]

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) and [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to:

1. Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include [Filelog Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver), [Fluent Forward Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/fluentforwardreceiver), and [Syslog Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/syslogreceiver).
2. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include [Resource Detection Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor) and [Resource Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourceprocessor/README.md).
3. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter.

### Correlate your application logs [#log-correlation]

Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry [semantic convention for services](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions#service) specifies `service.name` as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same `service.name` are associated with the same [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic).

The specifics of how logs get annotated with the `service.name` resource attribute depends on the application's environment:

* Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include `service.name` as another field.
* You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated [Collector agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#agent) instance, which you can configure with a [Resource processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/resourceprocessor) to annotate logs with the `service.name` attribute.

Optionally, additional application [trace context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/overview.md#log-correlation) (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified [trace context fields](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#trace-context-fields) on available log messages. For more details, see [OpenTelemetry in the UI: Logs page](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-logs-page).

The [Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/java/logs-in-context-log4j2) demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

### View OpenTelemetry logs [#view-logs]

Here are two ways you can view logs:

* Look in the New Relic [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the [context of the application](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-opentelemetry-data-new-relic#logs).

### The time field [#log-time]

The `timeUnixNano` field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When `timeUnixNano` is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.
