metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry compression and New Relic.
---

To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads transported via gRPC or HTTP. The maximum allowed payload size is 1MB (10^6 bytes).

If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP). Note that you can [sign up for CNCF's Slack account here](https://slack.cncf.io/).
