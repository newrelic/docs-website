To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. New Relic supports `gzip` and `zstd` compression for OTLP payloads transported via gRPC or HTTP with a maximum allowed payload size of 1MB (10^6 bytes).

## OTel collector configuration
The default compression for the OTLP exporter in the OTel collector is currently `gzip`, while `zstd` compression often proves more efficient. See [compression comparison](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md#compression-comparison) for more details on benchmark information.

To enable `zstd` in the collector, adapt the collector exporter config:

```yml
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    ...
    compression: zstd
```

If you'd like to see us support other compression formats, please let us know in the [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP). You can [sign up for CNCF's Slack account here](https://slack.cncf.io/).
