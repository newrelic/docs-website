metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry resources and New Relic.
---

A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. Make sure all telemetry data sent to New Relic is associated with a resource so it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The [OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md) defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource.

The following suites of attributes are defined by the [OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions#resource-semantic-conventions). These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK.

* `service.* attributes`
  * `service.name` attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI
  * `service.instance.id` is required for certain panes to light up
* `telemetry.sdk.language=java` is required to see data in the JVM section
