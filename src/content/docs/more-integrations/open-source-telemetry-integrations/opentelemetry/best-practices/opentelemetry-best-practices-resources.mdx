metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry resources and New Relic.
---

A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. Make sure all telemetry data sent to New Relic is associated with a resource so it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The [OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md) defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource.

The following suites of attributes are defined by the [OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions#resource-semantic-conventions). These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK.

* `service.* attributes`
  * `service.name` attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI 
  * `service.instance.id` is required for certain panes to light up
* `telemetry.sdk.language=java` is required to see data in the JVM section 

## Organize your entities in the UI using tags [#tags]

You can use tags to organize and filter your entities in the UI. [Tags](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) are key-value pairs, for example `team: operations`, added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts. Certain important attributes are automatically available as tags, such as account ID; you can also add your own custom tags [directly in the UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-tags), or with one of the methods below.

Use the [resource processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourceprocessor) to add resource attributes prefixed with `tags`, which will result in a tag on your entity in New Relic. For example, adding the attribute `tags.mytag=myvalue` will result in the entity tag `mytag=myvalue`. Here’s an example configuration:

You can also add resource attributes directly in the resource builder in your SDK (check your language SDK repo for how to do this, and remember to use the prefix `tags.`), or export them as [environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/#otel_resource_attributes).
