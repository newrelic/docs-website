Alerts is a tool you can use to notify yourself and others if your telemetry exceeds some particular thresholds. Thresholds are defined by conditions you create, and you can group those conditions into policies.

Depending on your role, you may use conditions to define the incidents you and your team are notified about or you may be responding to those incidents and want to know the condition that caused it.

## Create alert conditions [#create-alerts]

Conditions use NRQL queries to define what you want to be notified about. Use the condition UI to set the specific thresholds that generate an incident and its notification. Writing a NRQL query from scratch might seem daunting, but if you create a condition from a New Relic chart, we'll populate the condition with the NRQL used to generate the chart. Then, you can modify the query if you want and then set the condition thresholds.

Here's how to try this:

1. In the upper right corner of any chart, click the ellipsis button ('...'), then click <DoNotTranslate>**Create alert condition**</DoNotTranslate>:

    <img
      src={opentelemetryCreateAlertCondition}
      title="Create alert condition"
      alt="Create alert condition"
    />
    * If the chart displays a single metric, use the slide-out window to create a new alert condition, with the NRQL query pre-populated.
    * If the chart displays multiple queries, you will be asked to choose which query you want to use.
2. In the condition creation form, you can select an existing policy or create a new one. The policy will determine how you are notified when the condition triggers an alert.

## See your current alerts [#see-alerts-list]

If you're responsible for responding to incidents, you may also want to know what <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> are set up for each of your services. You can quickly get a list of all the conditions and their related policies from the UI:

1. From <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DoNotTranslate>, click <DoNotTranslate>**All entities**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. In the left navigation pane, select <DoNotTranslate>**Services - OpenTelemetry**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Click the service name you want to investigate.
4. In the left pane under <DoNotTranslate>**Settings**</DoNotTranslate>, click <DoNotTranslate>**Alert conditions**</DoNotTranslate>.
  <img
    src={opentelemetryAlertsConditionList}
    title="Screenshot showing the Alert conditions page for Opentelemetry"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Alert conditions page for Opentelemetry"
  />

On the <DoNotTranslate>**Alert conditions**</DoNotTranslate> page, besides being able to see details about the alerts, you can also add a warning. You might do this to ensure you are notified if a threshold is approaching critical. In the <DoNotTranslate>**Thresholds**</DoNotTranslate> column, when you click on <DoNotTranslate>**Create a warning**</DoNotTranslate>, you are taken directly to the alert condition editor where you can add a warning threshold.
