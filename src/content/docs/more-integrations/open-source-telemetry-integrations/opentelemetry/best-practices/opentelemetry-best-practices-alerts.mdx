Alerts is a New Relic tool you can use to notify yourself if your telemetry exceeds some particular thresholds. The thresholds you set up are just conditions you create, and you can group those conditions into alerts policies. 

Depending on your role, you may be involved in creating alerts, or you may be responding to alerts and want to know which alerts have been set up.

## Create alert conditions [#create-alerts]

Alert conditions are queries written in NRQL, our SQL-like query language. Writing a NRQL query from scratch might seem daunting, but if you create a condition from a New Relic chart, we'll write the NRQL to get you started:

1. Click on the ellipses icon in the upper right corner of a chart to reveal its action menu. There, you will see an option to **Create alert condition**.

    <img
      src={inContextDemo}
      title="In-context demo"
      alt="Animated GIF showing in-context demo"
    />
    * If the chart displays a single metric, a slide out window will appear to create a new alert condition, with the NRQL query pre-populated.
    * If the chart displays multiple queries, you will be asked to choose which query you want to use.
2. In the condition creation form, you can select an existing policy or create a new one.

For additional help creating alerts, see [Introduction to alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).

## See your current alerts [#see-alerts-list]

If you're responsible for responding to alerts, you may also want to know what alerts are set up for each of your services. You can quickly get a list of all the conditions and their related policies from the UI:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Explorer**.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Servcies - OpenTelemetry**.
3. Click the service name you want to investigate.
4. In the left pane under **Settings**, click **Alert conditions**.
  <img
    src={otelAlertsConditionList}
    title="Screenshot showing the Alert conditions page for Opentelemetry"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Alert conditions page for Opentelemetry"
  />

On the **Alert conditions** page, besides being able to see details about the alerts, you can also add a warning. You might do this to ensure you are notified if a threshold is approaching critical. In the **Thresholds** column, when you click on **Create a warning**, you are taken directly to the alert condition editor where you can add a warning threshold.
