metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry traces and New Relic.
---

Familiarize yourself with these OpenTelemetry trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic.

<Callout variant="important">
As the OpenTelemetry Protocol matures and more components are declared [stable](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto#maturity-level), we intend to move the version supported by our OTLP endpoints from v0.10.0 to a more recent release, at least v0.16.0, before September 2022.

Additional communication will be forthcoming regarding the EOL timeline for v0.10.0 support and actions you can take to minimize disruption as the community moves toward a more stable release of OTLP.

### Required fields [#required]

The `startTimeUnixNano` and `endTimeUnixNano` fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for [trace data](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/74e38fb4882dd500d77b757d44e97de296c65b05/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L145-L159). When `startTimeUnixNano` is not present, the span is dropped and a [`NrIntegrationError`](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror/) is created. When `endTimeUnixNano` is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative.

The `timeUnixNano` field on span events is required. When `timeUnixNano` is not present, the span event is dropped and a [`NrIntegrationError`](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror/) is created.

The `traceId` and `spanId` fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for [trace data](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/74e38fb4882dd500d77b757d44e97de296c65b05/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L73-L84). When `traceId` or `spanId` are not present, the span is dropped and a [`NrIntegrationError`](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror/) is created.

### Sampling [#sampling]

Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy.

You can configure sampling in a number of places:

* **Service:** Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language.
* **Collector:** If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling ([see below](#infinite-tracing)).

Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling:

    Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to configure applications (or the collector) to export trace data to the New Relic trace observer using OTLP gRPC:

    1. Follow the steps in [Set up the trace observer](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer/) to get the value for <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
    2. As you complete the steps in the [quick start guide](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start/#review-settings), use the value of <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var> to configure your integration. `YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL` follows the form `https://{trace-observer}:443/trace/v1`. When setting the OTLP gRPC endpoint, strip off the `/trace/v1` suffix, resulting in a URL of the form `https://{trace-observer}:443`.
    3. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that all applications involved in the trace have [configured](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) the OpenTelemetry SDK with a sampler which allows tail-based sampling. The default `parentbased_always_on` as well as the `always_on` samplers are good choices.

       Note that only trace data can be sent to trace observer endpoints. Your application (or collector) will need to separately configure export strategies for OpenTelemetry metrics and logs.
