Monitor Jenkins with the [OpenTelemetry plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry) by visualizing jobs and pipeline executions as [distributed traces](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing). You can also install the [quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/jenkins) to get a pre-built dashboard to monitor your Jenkins pipeline.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

You need to first install the OpenTelemetry plugin from Jenkins:

1. Log into Jenkins.
2. From the Dashboard, click on **Manage Jenkins**.
3. Under System Configuration, click **Plugins**.
4. Click the **Available plugins** tab, then search for **OpenTelemetry**.
5. Select the **OpenTelemetry** checkbox, and **Install without restart**.
6. Once the installation is complete, click **Manage Jenkins**.
7. Under **System Configuration**, click **System**.
8. Scroll down and check for a section called **OpenTelemetry**. If you can't see it, restart Jenkins.

## Configuration [#configuration]

You need a New Relic [OTLP Endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#note-endpoints) and an <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> to configure the Jenkins OpenTelemetry plugin to send data to New Relic.

/>

1. Enter an OTLP Endpoint. For example, `https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317`.
2. For authentication, select **Header Authentication**:
   a. In the **Header Name** field, enter **api-key**.
   b. In the **Header Value** field, enter a secret text containing your New Relic ingest license key.
3. Save the changes.

If you don't have a secret text created with your New Relic license key, click the **+ Add** button and select **Jenkins Credentials Provider**, to create one. You can keep the default values except for **kind** and **secret** and the **description** is optional.

1. From the **Kind** dropdown, select **Secret text**.
2. In the **secret** field, enter your New Relic ingest license key.
3. Optionally, add a description to note what the secret text is for.

## Validation [#validation]

Run a job or create a new pipeline to see Jenkins data in New Relic. Here's how to build a pipeline:

1. Log into Jenkins and click **New Item**.
2. Enter an item name, click **Pipeline**, and then **OK**.
3. Scroll down to the very bottom to the **Pipeline** section.
4. Use the Pipeline script, and select an option from the **try sample Pipeline...** dropdown.
5. Click Save.
6. In the newly created pipeline, click **Build Now**.
7. Got to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > Services - OpenTelemetry > jenkins**.
8. Click **Distributed tracing** to visualize jobs and pipeline executions.
9. Click **Logs** to see your Jenkins console logs. If there are no logs, check to make sure the environment variable `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER="otlp"` is set.

## Install the Jenkins quickstart dashboard [#quickstart]

After you've sent your Jenkins pipeline data to New Relic, you can also easily monitor your jobs and pipeline executions with the prebuilt dashboard from [New Relic Instant Observability](http://newrelic.com/instant-observability). Get started in minutes with a pre-built dashboard to see key metrics in a consolidated view:

1. Go to the Jenkins quickstart in [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/jenkins), and click **+ Install now**.
2. Select an account and click **Begin installation**.
3. If you've already completed the [validation](#validation), select **done** to move onto the next step.
4. The quickstart deploys the resources to your account. Click **see your data** to get to the dashboard.

<Callout variant="important">
  The Jenkins OpenTelemetry plugin is not maintained by New Relic, so if you have any issues with the instrumentation, [create a new issue in the plugin's GitHub repo](https://github.com/jenkinsci/opentelemetry-plugin/issues).
