title: 'Getting started with New Relic and Terraform'
metaDescription: 'Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).'
---

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts.

In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the [four golden signals](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals) of monitoring introduced in [Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html):

- **Latency:** The amount of time it takes your application to service a request.
- **Traffic:** The amount of requests your system receives.
- **Errors:** The rate of requests that fail.
- **Saturation:** The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application.

## Before you begin

To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, [install New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent) for your application. Also, [install the Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cli).

<Steps>

<Step>

## Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider

Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file:

```bash
mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project
touch main.tf
```

Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the `terraform` and `required_providers` blocks in **main.tf**:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Require Terraform version 1.0 (recommended)
  required_version = "~> 1.0"

  # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider
  required_providers {
    newrelic = {
      source  = "newrelic/newrelic"
    }
  }
}
```

In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 1.0 and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right [version constraints](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/version-constraints.html) for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs.

Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider.

</Step>



<Step>

## Configure the New Relic provider

With `terraform` all set, configure the New Relic `provider` with the following items:

1. Your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
2. Your [New Relic user key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key). Most user keys begin with the prefix `NRAK-`.
3. Your [New Relic region](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers#verifying-account). Your region is `US` if your account settings page is located at `one.newrelic.com`, and `EU` if your account is located at `one.eu.newrelic.com`.

In **main.tf**, set those values on the provider:

```hcl
provider "newrelic" {
  account_id = 12345   # Your New Relic account ID
  api_key = "NRAK-***" # Your New Relic user key
  region = "US"        # US or EU (defaults to US)
}
```

By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs.

<Callout variant="tip">

You can also configure the New Relic provider using [environment variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/provider_configuration). This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration.

For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/provider_configuration).

</Callout>

With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running `terraform plan`. Before you can run `terraform plan`, however, you need to create your resources.

</Step>


<Step>

## Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts

With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application.

Since you're targeting a specific application, use a [`newrelic_entity`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/data-sources/entity) to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration:

```hcl
data "newrelic_entity" "example_app" {
  name = "Your App Name" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic
  domain = "APM" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain
  type = "APPLICATION"
}
```

Next, create a [`newrelic_alert_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_policy). Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy:

```hcl
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "golden_signal_policy" {
  name = "Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}"
}
```

At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run `terraform apply`:

```bash copyable=false
[output] {muted}# Example output
[output] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[output]
[output] An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
[output] Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
[output]   + create
[output]
[output] Terraform will perform the following actions:
[output]
[output]   # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created
[output]   + resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "golden_signal_policy" {
[output]       + account_id          = (known after apply)
[output]       + id                  = (known after apply)
[output]       + incident_preference = "PER_POLICY"
[output]       + name                = "Golden Signals - Your App Name"
[output]     }
[output]
[output] Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
[output]
[output] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run `terraform apply`. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Every time you `apply` changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type "yes".

While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console:

```bash copyable=false
[output] {muted}# Example output of `terraform apply`
[output] newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating...
[output] newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333]
[output]
[output] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

[Log in to New Relic](https://login.newrelic.com/login) and [navigate to **Alert Policies**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy#alert-policy-view) to confirm that Terraform created your new policy.

As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run `terraform apply` after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources.

</Step>



<Step>

## Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals

Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step.

**Latency**

Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a [`newrelic_alert_condition`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_condition) that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes:

```hcl
# Response time
resource "newrelic_alert_condition" "response_time_web" {
  policy_id       = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id
  name            = "High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}"
  type            = "apm_app_metric"
  entities        = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id]
  metric          = "response_time_web"
  runbook_url     = "https://www.example.com"
  condition_scope = "application"

  term {
    duration      = 5
    operator      = "above"
    priority      = "critical"
    threshold     = "5"
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```

Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with `policy_id`.

**Traffic**

Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a `newrelic_alert_condition` that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes:

```hcl
# Low throughput
resource "newrelic_alert_condition" "throughput_web" {
  policy_id       = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id
  name            = "Low Throughput (Web)"
  type            = "apm_app_metric"
  entities        = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id]
  metric          = "throughput_web"
  condition_scope = "application"

  # Define a critical alert threshold that will
  # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute.
  term {
    priority      = "critical"
    duration      = 5
    operator      = "below"
    threshold     = "5"
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```

This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem.

**Errors**

If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a `newrelic_alert_condition` that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes:

```hcl
# Error percentage
resource "newrelic_alert_condition" "error_percentage" {
  policy_id       = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id
  name            = "High Error Percentage"
  type            = "apm_app_metric"
  entities        = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id]
  metric          = "error_percentage"
  runbook_url     = "https://www.example.com"
  condition_scope = "application"

  # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate.
  term {
    duration      = 5
    operator      = "above"
    threshold     = "5"
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```

**Saturation**

Saturation represents how "full" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a [New Relic Infrastructure](https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure) agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold:

```hcl
# High CPU usage
resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "high_cpu" {
  policy_id   = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id
  name        = "High CPU usage"
  type        = "infra_metric"
  event       = "SystemSample"
  select      = "cpuPercent"
  comparison  = "above"
  runbook_url = "https://www.example.com"
  where       = "(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')"

  # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization.
  critical {
    duration      = 5
    value         = 90
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```

For the Infrastructure alert, you created a [`newrelic_infra_alert_condition`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/infra_alert_condition) that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes.

</Step>



<Step>

## Get notified when an alert triggers

Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification destination and a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a [`newrelic_notification_destination`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/notification_destination) and a [`newrelic_notification_channel`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/notification_channel).

To begin, create an email notification destination to configure your recipients list, which can be a specific person or a team. This will be used when creating a notification channel:

```hcl
resource "newrelic_notification_destination" "team_email_destination" {
  name = "email-example"
  type = "EMAIL"

  property {
    key = "email"
    value = "team.member1@email.com,team.member2@email.com,team.member3@email.com"
  }
}
```
If you want to specify multiple emails, use a comma-delimited list of emails.


Then, create an email notification channel template to send alert notifications to your email. Associate the channel with the destination id:

```hcl
resource "newrelic_notification_channel" "team_email_channel" {
  name = "email-example"
  type = "EMAIL"
  destination_id = newrelic_notification_destination.team_email_destination.id
  product = "IINT"

  property {
    key = "subject"
    value = "New Subject"
  }
}
```

Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a [`newrelic_workflow`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/workflow):

```hcl
resource "newrelic_workflow" "team_workflow" {
  name = "workflow-example"
  enrichments_enabled = true
  destinations_enabled = true
  workflow_enabled = true
  muting_rules_handling = "NOTIFY_ALL_ISSUES"

  enrichments {
    nrql {
      name = "Log"
      configurations {
       query = "SELECT count(*) FROM Metric"
      }
    }
  }

  issues_filter {
    name = "filter-example"
    type = "FILTER"

    predicates {
      attribute = "accumulations.sources"
      operator = "EXACTLY_MATCHES"
      values = [ "newrelic" ]
    }
  }

  destination_configurations {
    channel_id = newrelic_notification_channel.team_email_channel.id
  }
}
```

A `newrelic_workflow` links the notification channel you just created to your alerts.

To finalize your notifications configuration, run `terraform apply` one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date.

## Get notified when an alert triggers (deprecated)

<Callout variant="important">

Alert channels is deprecated and won't be supported in future versions.

</Callout>

Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a [`newrelic_alert_channel`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_channel).

To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered:

```hcl
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "team_email" {
  name = "example"
  type = "email"

  config {
    recipients              = "yourawesometeam@example.com"
    include_json_attachment = "1"
  }
}
```

If you want to specify multiple `recipients`, use a comma-delimited list of emails.

Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a [`newrelic_alert_policy_channel`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_policy_channel):

```hcl
resource "newrelic_alert_policy_channel" "golden_signals" {
  policy_id   = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id
  channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id]
}
```

A `newrelic_alert_policy_channel` links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy.

To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run `terraform apply` one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Extra Credit">

`new_relic_alert_channel` [supports several types](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/alert_channel#argument-reference) of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack:

```hcl
# Slack notification channel
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "slack_notification" {
  name = "slack-example"
  type = "slack"

  config {
    # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration
    url     = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX"
    channel = "your-slack-channel-for-alerts"
  }
}
```

Before you `apply` this change, you need to add the [New Relic Slack App](https://slack.com/apps/A0F827KK2-new-relic-alerts) to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice.

## Conclusion

As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions.
