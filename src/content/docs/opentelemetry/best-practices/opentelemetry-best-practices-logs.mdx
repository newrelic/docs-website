This documentation focuses on how New Relic processes OpenTelemetry logs received through its dedicated OTLP endpoint.

There are two typical workflows for sending OpenTelemetry logs to New Relic:

* [Direct to collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/#direct-to-collector):

  * Applications can send logs directly to the New Relic OTLP endpoint.
  * Refer to the relevant [OpenTelemetry language documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) for specific implementation details, and [OpenTelemetry APM monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/) for details on monitoring services with New Relic.

* [Via file or `stdout`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/#via-file-or-stdout-logs):
  * This method involves scraping application logs written to files or standard output (`stdout`).
  * The OpenTelemetry collector is typically used for this task. Scraped logs are then forwarded to the New Relic OTLP endpoint.
  * In-depth configuration information can be found in the following OpenTelemetry resources:
    * [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/)
    * [Filelog receiver with kubernetes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/collector/components/#filelog-receiver)
    * [A practical example demonstrating this workflow for Java applications using Log4j2](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/other-examples/java/logs-in-context-log4j2)

Regardless of the chosen collection method, successful integration requires configuring your log source to export logs to this endpoint. Make sure to review the [endpoint configuration requirements](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp/#configure-endpoint-port-protocol) before proceeding.

## OTLP log record mapping [#otlp-log-mapping]

New Relic maps OTLP log records to the `Log` data type. The table below describes how fields from the [`LogRecord` proto message](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto) are mapped to New Relic `Log`:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        OTLP `logs.proto` field
      </th>

      <th>
        New Relic `Log` field
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `ResourceLogs.Resource.attributes`
      </td>

      <td>
        Each key/value is an attribute on the `Log` field **[1]**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ScopeLogs.InstrumentationScope.name`
      </td>

      <td>
        `otel.library.name`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ScopeLogs.InstrumentationScope.attributes`
      </td>

      <td>
        Each key/value is an attribute on the `Log` field **[1]**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `LogRecord.time_unix_nanos`
      </td>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `LogRecord.severity_text`
      </td>

      <td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `LogRecord.attributes`
      </td>

      <td>
        Each key/value is an attribute on the `Log` field **[1]**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `LogRecord.dropped_attribute_count`
      </td>

      <td>
        `otel.dropped_attributes_count`

    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>

      <td>

### Table footnotes [#otlp-mapping-notes]

**[1]** In case of conflict in resource attributes, scope attributes, log record attributes, top level log record fields, and parsed attributes from the `LogRecord.body` **[3]**, the order of precedent (highest to lowest) is: parsed attributes from `LogRecord.body` -> top level `LogRecord.*` fields > `LogRecord.attributes` > `ScopeLogs.InstrumentationScope.attributes` > `ResourceLogs.Resource.attributes`.

**[2]** If `LogRecord.time_unix_nanos` is not present, `timestamp` is set to the time New Relic received the data.

**[3]** [Log parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing/) is applied to the `LogRecord.body` to attempt to extract attributes from plain log text. For example, if a JSON structured log format is used, the key / values become attributes on the resulting log. This is particularly useful when collecting logs from files or `stdout`. In this case, it's common to have no resource attributes associated with the log record (required for [APM service correlation](#service-correlation)) and no value for `LogRecord.trace_id` / `LogRecord.span_id` (required for [trace correlation](#trace-correlation)). Correlation will function as intended if the required fields can be successfully parsed.

## Correlation with OpenTelemetry APM service [#service-correlation]

Log are correlated with a service entity if they include the [required attributes](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources/#required-attributes). Typically, these come from the log's resource attributes, such as `ResourceLogs.Resource.attributes`, but they can also be parsed from the `LogRecord.body` as described in [footnote #3 of OTLP mapping](#otlp-mapping-notes).

To view a service's logs, navigate to the [Logs page](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) for that service.

## Correlation with traces [#trace-correlation]

Logs are correlated with a trace if `trace.id` and `span.id` attributes can be resolved. Typically, these come from `LogRecord.trace_id` and `LogRecord.span_id` fields, but can also be parsed from the `LogRecord.body` as described in footnote 3 of [OTLP mapping](#otlp-mapping-notes).

To view logs recorded in the context of a particular trace, you have two options:

* Navigate to the **Logs** tab within the [trace details page](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/trace-details/#view-your-logs).
* Navigate to the [Logs page](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) for a service and click on a log to open log details. If it's associated with a trace, you'll be able to navigate from **Log details** to **Trace details**.
