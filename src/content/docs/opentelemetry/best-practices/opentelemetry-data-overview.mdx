OpenTelemetry has a rich ecosystem of instrumentation and tooling which can be integrated with New Relic via [OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/). This documentation describes how New Relic receives, processes, and ingests OTLP data. See [Get started with OpenTelemetry and New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-get-started-intro/) for information on common integration patterns.

[New Relic OTLP endpoint](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp/) describes OTLP configuration requirements relevant for any OpenTelemetry integration with New Relic, along with [troubleshooting](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp-troubleshooting/) information.

OTLP is divided into trace, metric, and log signals, all of which include the concept of resources. See the following pages for details on how each is processed and ingested:

* [OpenTelemetry traces in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-traces/)
* [OpenTelemetry metrics in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-metrics/)
* [OpenTelemetry logs in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs/)
* [OpenTelemetry resources in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources/)

For details on OpenTelemetry data volume in New Relic and management tools, see  [Manage OpenTelemetry data ingest volume](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-manage-data-ingest-volume/).

All OTLP data is ingested into the [New Relic platform](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform/), which includes many powerful general purpose observability tools to help you identify and diagnose problems, including:

* [Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/): Get informed when a signal exceeds a threshold.
* [Custom Queries](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/): Write custom NRQL queries for adhoc data analysis and exploration.
* [Dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/): Create custom data visualizations reflecting the unique requirements of your applications.
