All data from OpenTelemetry is associated with a [resource](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/resources).
A resource is a representation of the entity producing telemetry as resource
attributes. The resource attributes are used to adapt a resource to New Relic's
notion of an [entity](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic).

Data received is associated with an entity through a process called [entity synthesis](/docs/entities/synthesis/)
whereby the resource attributes present are matched to rules which determine the type of entity the
data will be associated with. For data sourced from OpenTelemetry, the entity synthesis rules are
designed to respect the OpenTelemetry [resource semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource).

The resource semantic conventions define different bodies of conventions for
describing different types of entities. For example, the
[service](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service) and
[host](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host/)
conventions define the resource attributes which describe a service or host instance,
respectively.

## Supported entity types [#supported-entity-types]

Described here are the New Relic entity types which are supported when using
OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Included for each supported entity type are:

* The resource attributes required for entity synthesis.
* Recommended attributes that drive certain aspects of the New Relic UI.
* Attributes which become [entity tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/),
  when present.

### Services [#services]

A service entity is synthesized by adhering to the OpenTelemetry resource
semantic conventions describing a
[service instance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service).

Refer to our
[documentation and examples](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app)
for monitoring service entities using OpenTelemetry.

#### Required attributes [#service-required-attributes]

* [`service.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service): The service name you see in the UI comes from this value.

#### Recommended attributes [#service-recommended-attributes]

* [`service.instance.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service): Enables faceting between multiple instances of the same service.
* [`telemetry.sdk.language`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry): When present, this value drives the display of any runtime-specific UI, such as the JVM runtime page for Java applications.

#### Entity tags [#service-entity-tags]

* [`service.namespace`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service)
* [`telemetry.sdk.language`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry) (added as language tag)
* [`telemetry.sdk.version`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry)
* [`k8s.cluster.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)
* [`k8s.namespace.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)
* [`k8s.deployment.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)

### Hosts [#hosts]

A host entity is synthesized by adhering to the OpenTelemetry resource semantic
conventions describing a [host](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host).

Refer to the host monitoring example in [collector for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-intro/) for more details.

#### Required attributes [#host-required-attributes]

* [`host.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host): The host name you see in the UI comes from this value.
* [`host.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)

#### Entity tags [#host-entity-tags]

* [`cloud.provider`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.account.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.region`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.availability_zone`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.platform`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`host.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.type`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.arch`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.version`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)

### Redis instances [#redis]

A redis instance is synthesized using data emitted from the collector [redis receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/redisreceiver). Unfortunately, there are currently no semantic conventions for redis instances, or identifying attributes in the metrics the redis receiver emits. Therefore, users are required to manually include the attributes described below.

Refer to the redis example in [collector for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-intro/) for more details.

#### Required attributes [#redis-required-attributes]

* [`server.address`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/): The redis instance name you see in the UI comes from this value.
* [`server.port`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)

#### Entity tags [#redis-entity-tags]

* `redis.version`
* `redis.role`
* [`host.type`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`cloud.provider`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.account.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.region`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* `instrumenation.name`
* [`server.address`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)
* [`server.port`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)

## Supported entity relationships [#supported-entity-relationships]

New Relic supports relationships between entities sourced from
OpenTelemetry instrumentation. These relationships are synthesized
automatically when the appropriate relationship criteria is met. Below are the
relationships that are currently supported and their required criteria.

### Service to host [#service-to-host]

Relationships between a service and host entity require that the service
includes the `host.id` resource attribute and that it matches the `host.id` of
the host it is running on.

## Adding custom tags to an entity [#tags]

You can use tags to organize and filter your entities in the UI.
[Tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/)
are key-value pairs, for example `team: operations`, added to various sets of
data, like monitored apps and hosts. Certain important attributes are
automatically available as tags, such as account ID; you can also add your own
custom tags
[directly in the UI](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-tags),
or with one of the methods below.

Adding resource attributes prefixed with `tags` will result in a tag on your
entity in New Relic. For example, adding the attribute `tags.mytag=myvalue`
will result in the entity tag `mytag=myvalue`.
