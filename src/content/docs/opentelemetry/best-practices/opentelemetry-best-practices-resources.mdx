All data from OpenTelemetry is associated with a [resource](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/resources).
A resource is a representation of the entity producing telemetry as resource
attributes. The resource attributes are used to adapt a resource to New Relic's
notion of an [entity](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic).

Data received is associated with an entity through a process called [entity synthesis](/docs/entities/synthesis/)
whereby the resource attributes present are matched to rules which determine the type of entity the
data will be associated with. For data sourced from OpenTelemetry, the entity synthesis rules are
designed to respect the OpenTelemetry [resource semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource).

The resource semantic conventions define different bodies of conventions for
describing different types of entities. For example, the
[service](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service) and
[host](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host/)
conventions define the resource attributes which describe a service or host instance,
respectively.

## Supported entity types [#supported-entity-types]

Described here are the New Relic entity types which are supported when using
OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Included for each supported entity type are:

* The resource attributes required for entity synthesis.
* Recommended attributes that drive certain aspects of the New Relic UI.
* Attributes which become [entity tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/),
  when present.

### Services [#services]

A service entity is synthesized by adhering to the OpenTelemetry resource
semantic conventions describing a
[service instance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service).

Refer to our
[documentation and examples](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro)
for monitoring service entities using OpenTelemetry.

#### Required attributes [#service-required-attributes]

* [`service.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service): The service name you see in the UI comes from this value.

#### Recommended attributes [#service-recommended-attributes]

* [`service.instance.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service): Enables faceting between multiple instances of the same service.
* [`telemetry.sdk.language`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry): When present, this value drives the display of any runtime-specific UI, such as the JVM runtime page for Java applications.

#### Entity tags [#service-entity-tags]

* [`service.namespace`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/service)
* [`telemetry.sdk.language`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry) (added as language tag)
* [`telemetry.sdk.version`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/telemetry)
* [`k8s.cluster.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)
* [`k8s.namespace.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)
* [`k8s.deployment.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s)

### Hosts [#hosts]

A host entity is synthesized by adhering to the OpenTelemetry resource semantic
conventions describing a [host](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/host).

Refer to the host monitoring example in [collector for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-intro/) for more details.

#### Required attributes [#host-required-attributes]

* [`host.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host): The host name you see in the UI comes from this value.
* [`host.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)

#### Entity tags [#host-entity-tags]

* [`cloud.provider`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.account.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.region`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.availability_zone`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.platform`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`host.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.type`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.arch`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`host.image.version`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)

### Redis instances [#redis]

A redis instance is synthesized using data emitted from the Collector [Redis receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/redisreceiver). Unfortunately, there are currently no semantic conventions for Redis instances, or identifying attributes in the metrics the Redis receiver emits. Therefore, users are required to manually include the attributes described below.

Refer to the Redis example in [collector for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-intro/) for more details.

#### Required attributes [#redis-required-attributes]

* [`server.address`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/): The redis instance name you see in the UI comes from this value.
* [`server.port`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)

#### Entity tags [#redis-entity-tags]

* `redis.version`
* `redis.role`
* [`host.type`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/host)
* [`cloud.provider`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.account.id`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* [`cloud.region`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/cloud)
* `instrumenation.name`
* [`server.address`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)
* [`server.port`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/server/)

## Supported entity relationships [#supported-entity-relationships]

New Relic supports relationships between entities sourced from
OpenTelemetry instrumentation. These relationships are synthesized
automatically when the appropriate relationship criteria is met. Below are the
relationships that are currently supported and their required criteria.

### Service to host [#service-to-host]

Relationships between a service and host entity require that the service
includes the `host.id` resource attribute and that it matches the `host.id` of
the host it is running on.

### Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams

Your infrastructure hosted in AWS can be monitored with New Relic's integration
with [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams](/install/aws-cloudwatch/). This is not
an OpenTelemetry solution for monitoring your infrastructure. However, New
Relic supports a number of relationships between OpenTelemetry instrumented
services and infrastructure monitored using Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams.

<Callout variant="important">
  The relationships described below leverage OpenTelemetry semantic conventions.
  Many of these conventions are not yet stable and are still evolving.
  Instrumentation that produces telemetry for the frameworks below vary in
  their level of maturity and conformance to the semantic conventions. As
  such, the instrumentation you use may not emit the attributes required for
  these relationships to work. Please reach out to the maintainers of the
  instrumentation you're using with any questions about the instrumentation's
  maturity with respect to OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions.
</Callout>

#### ElastiCache (Memcached)

The Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration for
[Elasticache](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-elasticache-monitoring-integration/)
generates ElastiCache entities in New Relic. These entities will have the
following entity tags:

* `aws.elasticache.configurationEndpointAddress` or `aws.elasticache.endpointAddress`
* `aws.elasticache.configurationEndpointPort` or `aws.elasticache.endpointPort`

If your services use OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Memcached it must emit
the following attributes for a relationship to be generated:

* `db.system`: This attribute must have the value `memcached`.
* `net.peer.name`: This attribute must match the corresponding endpoint tag of
  the ElastiCache entity.
* `net.peer.port`: This attribute must match the corresponding port tag of the
  ElastiCache entity.

#### Amazon MQ (ActiveMQ)

The Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration for
[Amazon MQ](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-mq-integration)
generates Amazon MQ entities in New Relic. These entities will have the
following entity tag:

* `aws.mq.endpoint`

If your services use OpenTelemetry instrumentation for ActiveMQ it must
the following attributes for a relationship to be generated:

* `messaging.system`: This attribute must have the value `activemq`.
* `server.address`: This attribute must match the corresponding endpoint tag
  of the Amazon MQ entity.
* `span.kind`: This relationship is generated from span data where `span.kind`
  is `producer` or `consumer`.

#### Amazon Managed Kafka (MSK)

The Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration for
[MSK](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-managed-kafka-msk-integration)
generates MSK entities in New Relic. These entities will have the
following entity tag:

* `aws.clusterName` or `aws.kafka.ClusterName`
* `aws.awsRegion` or `aws.region`
* `aws.topic` or `aws.kafka.Topic`

If your services use OpenTelemetry instrumentation for MSK it must have
the following attributes for a relationship to be generated:

* `messaging.destination.name`: The MSK topic to which the service is either producing messages or consuming messages.
* `server.address`: This attribute must match the corresponding endpoint tag
  of the MSK entity.
* `span.kind`: This relationship is generated from span data where `span.kind`
  is `producer` or `consumer`.

## Adding custom tags to an entity [#tags]

You can use tags to organize and filter your entities in the UI.
[Tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/)
are key-value pairs, for example `team: operations`, added to various sets of
data, like monitored apps and hosts. Certain important attributes are
automatically available as tags, such as account ID; you can also add your own
custom tags
[directly in the UI](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-tags),
or with one of the methods below.

Adding resource attributes prefixed with `tags` will result in a tag on your
entity in New Relic. For example, adding the attribute `tags.mytag=myvalue`
will result in the entity tag `mytag=myvalue`.
