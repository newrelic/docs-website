Kafka monitoring provides real-time visibility into your Apache Kafka clusters to ensure reliable data streaming and prevent costly downtime in distributed systems. Using OpenTelemetry Collector, you get comprehensive monitoring through a flexible, vendor-neutral approach that works across self-hosted environments and Kubernetes with Strimzi.

## Why Kafka monitoring?
- Prevent outages - Get alerts for broker failures, under-replicated partitions, and offline topics before they cause downtime
- Optimize performance - Identify consumer lag, slow producers, and network bottlenecks that affect data processing speed
- Plan capacity - Track resource usage, message rates, and connection counts to scale proactively
- Ensure data integrity - Monitor replication health and partition balance to prevent data loss

### Common use case

Whether you're streaming financial transactions, processing IoT sensor data, or handling microservices communication, Kafka monitoring helps you catch issues before they impact your business. Get alerted when consumer lag spikes threaten real-time dashboards, when broker failures risk data loss, or when network bottlenecks slow down critical data pipelines. This monitoring is essential for e-commerce platforms, real-time analytics systems, and any application where message delivery delays or failures can affect user experience or business operations.

## Get started [#get-started]

Choose your Kafka environment to begin monitoring. Each setup guide includes prerequisites, configuration steps, and troubleshooting tips.

## How it works [#how-it-works]

The OpenTelemetry Collector connects to your Kafka cluster using two specialized receivers:

**Data collection:**
- **[Kafka metrics receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kafkametricsreceiver)** connects to Kafka's bootstrap port for cluster health, consumer lag, topic metrics, and partition status
- **[JMX receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jmxreceiver)** connects to broker JMX ports for performance metrics, JVM data, and detailed operational insights

**Data flow:**
1. Collectors gather metrics from both receivers simultaneously
2. Data is processed, enriched, and batched for efficient transmission
3. Metrics are exported to New Relic via the OTLP exporter
4. New Relic automatically creates entities and populates dashboards

**What you get:**
Key metrics include consumer lag, broker health, request rates, network throughput, partition replication status, and resource utilization.

For complete metric names, descriptions, and alerting recommendations, see [Kafka metrics reference](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/metrics-reference).

### Optional: Add application-level monitoring

The monitoring setup above tracks your Kafka cluster health and performance. To get the full picture of how data flows through your system, you can also monitor the applications that send and receive messages from Kafka.

**Application monitoring adds:**
- Request latencies from your apps to Kafka
- Throughput metrics at the application level
- Error rates and distributed traces
- Complete visibility from producers → brokers → consumers

**Quick setup:** Use the [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/getting-started/) for [zero-code Kafka instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/out-of-the-box-instrumentation/). For advanced configuration, see the [Kafka instrumentation documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/kafka).

Ready to start monitoring your Kafka clusters?

**Set up monitoring:**
- **[Self-hosted Kafka](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/self-hosted)** - Monitor Kafka running on physical or virtual machines
- **[Kubernetes with Strimzi](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/kubernetes-strimzi)** - Monitor Kafka deployed on Kubernetes

**After setup:**
- **[Find and query your data](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/find-and-query-data)** - Navigate New Relic UI and write NRQL queries
- **[Explore Kafka metrics](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/metrics-reference)** - Complete metrics reference with alerting recommendations
