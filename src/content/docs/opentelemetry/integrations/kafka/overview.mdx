Kafka monitoring provides real-time visibility into your Apache Kafka clusters to ensure reliable data streaming and prevent costly downtime in distributed systems. Using a collector-based approach, you get comprehensive monitoring through a flexible, vendor-neutral solution that works across self-hosted environments and Kubernetes with Strimzi.

## Collector options [#collector-options]

Choose between two collector distributions to monitor your Kafka clusters:

* **NRDOT Collector** (recommended): New Relic's distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector with New Relic support for assistance. Download from [NRDOT Collector releases](https://github.com/newrelic/nrdot-collector-releases/releases).
* **OpenTelemetry Collector**: The upstream community distribution. Download from [OpenTelemetry Collector releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases).

Both collectors use identical configuration files and provide the same Kafka monitoring capabilities. The setup guides include tabs for both options.

## Why Kafka monitoring?
- Prevent outages - Get alerts for broker failures, under-replicated partitions, and offline topics before they cause downtime
- Optimize performance - Identify consumer lag, slow producers, and network bottlenecks that affect data processing speed
- Plan capacity - Track resource usage, message rates, and connection counts to scale proactively
- Ensure data integrity - Monitor replication health and partition balance to prevent data loss

### Common use case

Whether you're streaming financial transactions, processing IoT sensor data, or handling microservices communication, Kafka monitoring helps you catch issues before they impact your business. Get alerted when consumer lag spikes threaten real-time dashboards, when broker failures risk data loss, or when network bottlenecks slow down critical data pipelines. This monitoring is essential for e-commerce platforms, real-time analytics systems, and any application where message delivery delays or failures can affect user experience or business operations.

## Get started [#get-started]

Choose your Kafka environment to begin monitoring. Each setup guide includes prerequisites, configuration steps, and troubleshooting tips.

## How it works [#how-it-works]

The collector (NRDOT or OpenTelemetry) connects to your Kafka cluster using specialized receivers and the OpenTelemetry Java Agent:

**Data collection:**
- **[Kafka metrics receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kafkametricsreceiver)** connects to Kafka's bootstrap port for cluster health, consumer lag, topic metrics, and partition status
- **[OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation)** with JMX metrics enabled runs as a Java agent attached to Kafka brokers, collecting JMX metrics and sending them via OTLP (gRPC) to the collector
- **[OTLP receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver/otlpreceiver)** receives broker performance metrics, JVM data, and detailed operational insights from the Java agent

**Data flow:**
1. OpenTelemetry Java Agent attaches to Kafka brokers as a Java agent via `-javaagent` parameter
2. Java Agent collects JMX metrics from Kafka brokers using custom configuration rules
3. Metrics are sent via OTLP (gRPC) protocol to the OpenTelemetry Collector on port 4317
4. Kafka metrics receiver collects cluster-level metrics directly from Kafka via the bootstrap port
5. Data is processed, enriched, and batched for efficient transmission
6. Metrics are exported to New Relic via the OTLP exporter
7. New Relic automatically creates entities and populates dashboards

**What you get:**
Key metrics include consumer lag, broker health, request rates, network throughput, partition replication status, resource utilization, and JVM performance data.

For complete metric names, descriptions, and alerting recommendations, see [Kafka metrics reference](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/kafka/metrics-reference).

### Optional: Add application-level monitoring

The monitoring setup above tracks your Kafka cluster health and performance. To get the full picture of how data flows through your system, you can also monitor the applications that send and receive messages from Kafka.

**Application monitoring adds:**
- Request latencies from your apps to Kafka
- Throughput metrics at the application level
- Error rates and distributed traces
- Complete visibility from producers → brokers → consumers

**Quick setup:** Use the [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/getting-started/) for [zero-code Kafka instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/out-of-the-box-instrumentation/). For advanced configuration, see the [Kafka instrumentation documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/kafka).
