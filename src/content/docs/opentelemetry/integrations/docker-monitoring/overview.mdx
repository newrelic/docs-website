Docker container monitoring provides real-time visibility into your containerized applications to ensure reliable performance and prevent resource bottlenecks in distributed systems. Using OpenTelemetry Collector, you get comprehensive monitoring through a flexible, vendor-neutral approach that works across various container orchestration platforms.

## Why monitor Docker containers? [#why-monitor]

Container monitoring is essential for maintaining application performance and reliability in containerized environments. OpenTelemetry provides a standardized approach to collect and analyze this critical data.

### Key benefits

- **Resource optimization**: Track CPU, memory, network, and I/O usage to identify resource bottlenecks and optimize container resource allocation
- **Proactive monitoring**: Get alerts before containers exhaust resources, detect container failures early, and monitor container health
- **Operational insights**: Understand container lifecycle patterns, track performance trends, monitor container restart patterns and failure rates
- **Cost management**: Monitor resource utilization to right-size containers and optimize infrastructure costs
- **Future-proof**: Open-source OpenTelemetry standard provides vendor-neutral integration that adapts as your infrastructure evolves

### Common use case

Whether you're running microservices, web applications, or batch processing workloads, Docker monitoring helps you maintain reliable containerized services. Get notified when containers are consuming excessive memory, detect when your API containers are overwhelmed with requests, or identify which containers are experiencing network bottlenecks. This monitoring is essential for containerized applications handling user traffic, background job processing, data pipelines, and any workload where container performance directly impacts application reliability and user experience.

## How it works [#how-it-works]

The OpenTelemetry Collector connects to your Docker daemon using the Docker Stats API to collect comprehensive container metrics:

**Data collection:**
**[Docker Stats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver)** connects to the Docker socket (typically `/var/run/docker.sock`) to collect real-time container metrics including CPU, memory, network, and block I/O statistics.

**Data flow:**
1. The collector queries the Docker daemon's Stats API at regular intervals (default: 15 seconds)
2. Container metrics are collected, processed, and enriched with container metadata (name, image, ID)
3. Data is batched for efficient transmission to reduce network overhead
4. Metrics are exported to New Relic via the OTLP exporter
5. New Relic automatically creates container entities and populates monitoring dashboards

**What you get:**
Key metrics include CPU utilization, memory usage and limits, network I/O rates, block I/O operations, process counts, and container lifecycle events.

For complete metric names, descriptions, and alerting recommendations, see [Docker metrics reference](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/docker-monitoring/metrics-reference).

### Optional: Add application-level monitoring

The monitoring setup above tracks your Docker container resource usage and health. To get the full picture of how your applications perform inside containers, you can also add application-level monitoring.

**Application monitoring adds:**
- Request latencies from applications running in containers
- Application-specific metrics and traces
- Error rates and distributed traces across containerized services
- Complete visibility from container resources to application performance

**Quick setup:** Use [OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/) for your programming language to add zero-code application monitoring to your containerized services.
