Docker container monitoring provides real-time visibility into your containerized applications to ensure reliable performance and prevent resource bottlenecks in distributed systems. Using OpenTelemetry Collector, you get comprehensive monitoring through a flexible, vendor-neutral approach that works across various container orchestration platforms.

## Collector options [#collector-options]

New Relic supports two OpenTelemetry Collector distributions for Docker monitoring, both offering identical functionality with the same configuration files and monitoring capabilities:

<Collapser
  id="nrdot-collector"
  title="NRDOT Collector (recommended)"
>

**NRDOT Collector** is New Relic's optimized OpenTelemetry distribution that provides:
- **Pre-configured for New Relic**: Streamlined setup with built-in New Relic optimizations
- **Simplified installation**: Ready-to-use packages for major Linux distributions (DEB/RPM)
- **New Relic support**: Direct technical support and regular updates aligned with New Relic platform
- **Best practices**: Default configurations optimized for New Relic's telemetry backend

**Best for**: Teams wanting the easiest setup experience and primarily using New Relic for observability.

</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="opentelemetry-collector"
  title="OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib"
>

**OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib** is the upstream community distribution that offers:
- **Maximum flexibility**: Full control over all collector components and configurations
- **Multi-vendor support**: Send telemetry data to multiple observability platforms simultaneously
- **Latest features**: Access to the newest OpenTelemetry components and experimental features
- **Community-driven**: Open-source project with contributions from multiple vendors

**Best for**: Teams requiring multi-vendor telemetry, custom configurations, or contributing to the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

## Why monitor Docker containers? [#why-monitor]

Container monitoring is essential for maintaining application performance and reliability in containerized environments. OpenTelemetry provides a standardized approach to collect and analyze this critical data.

### Key benefits

- **Resource optimization**: Track CPU, memory, network, and I/O usage to identify resource bottlenecks and optimize container resource allocation
- **Proactive monitoring**: Get alerts before containers exhaust resources, detect container failures early, and monitor container health
- **Operational insights**: Understand container lifecycle patterns, track performance trends, monitor container restart patterns and failure rates
- **Cost management**: Monitor resource utilization to right-size containers and optimize infrastructure costs
- **Future-proof**: Open-source OpenTelemetry standard provides vendor-neutral integration that adapts as your infrastructure evolves

### Common use case

Whether you're running microservices, web applications, or batch processing workloads, Docker monitoring helps you maintain reliable containerized services. Get notified when containers are consuming excessive memory, detect when your API containers are overwhelmed with requests, or identify which containers are experiencing network bottlenecks. This monitoring is essential for containerized applications handling user traffic, background job processing, data pipelines, and any workload where container performance directly impacts application reliability and user experience.

## Get started [#get-started]

Ready to begin monitoring your Docker containers? Follow the [setup guide](/docs/opentelemetry/integrations/docker-monitoring/self-hosted) for your environment.

## How it works [#how-it-works]

The OpenTelemetry Collector connects to your Docker daemon using the Docker Stats API to collect comprehensive container metrics:

**Data collection:**
[Docker Stats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver) connects to the Docker socket (typically `/var/run/docker.sock`) to collect real-time container metrics including CPU, memory, network, and block I/O statistics.

**Data flow:**
1. The collector queries the Docker daemon's Stats API at regular intervals (default: 15 seconds)
2. Container metrics are collected, processed, and enriched with container metadata (name, image, ID)
3. Data is batched for efficient transmission to reduce network overhead
4. Metrics are exported to New Relic via the OTLP exporter
5. New Relic automatically creates container entities and populates monitoring dashboards

**What you get:**
Key metrics include CPU usage and utilization, memory usage and percentage, network I/O (bytes transmitted/received, packets dropped/errors), block I/O operations, and process counts. Container metadata such as name, image, and ID are automatically attached to all metrics.
