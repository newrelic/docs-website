Once your Docker container monitoring is configured with OpenTelemetry, your metrics will appear across multiple locations in New Relic. This guide shows you where to find your data and how to query it effectively for container performance analysis and troubleshooting.

## Navigate to your Docker data [#find-data]

Your Docker container metrics appear in several places across the New Relic platform, each optimized for different use cases:

### 1. Entity explorer
Best for: Quick health checks and container relationships

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > All entities**</DNT>
2. Filter by `entity.type = 'CONTAINER'` or search for your host name
3. View individual container entities grouped by host

The entity explorer shows your containers as individual entities, making it easy to see which containers are running on each host and their current health status.

### 2. Infrastructure monitoring
Best for: Host-centric container monitoring

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Infrastructure > Hosts**</DNT>
2. Select your Docker host to view container metrics alongside host metrics
3. Navigate to the **Containers** tab to see all containers running on that host

This view is ideal when you want to understand how container resource usage relates to overall host performance.

### 3. NRQL query builder
Best for: Custom analysis and troubleshooting

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Query your data**</DNT>
2. Start with `FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' AND container.name IS NOT NULL`
3. Build custom queries using Docker-specific attributes

### 4. Custom dashboards
Best for: Operational monitoring and reporting

Create custom dashboards using Docker metrics to monitor:
- Container resource utilization trends
- Container restart patterns
- Network performance by container
- Multi-container application health

## Query Docker data with NRQL [#query-data]

Use [NRQL](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to create custom queries and dashboards for your Docker container data.

## Advanced querying techniques [#advanced-techniques]

### Filtering by container attributes

Use container attributes to focus on specific subsets:

```sql
-- Monitor production containers only
FROM Metric SELECT average(container.cpu.utilization)
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
AND container.image.name LIKE '%prod%'
FACET container.name
SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES

-- Monitor containers by host
FROM Metric SELECT average(container.memory.percent)
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
AND host.name = 'production-docker-01'
FACET container.name
SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

### Calculating rates and percentages

For cumulative metrics, use the `rate()` function:

```sql
-- Network throughput rate
FROM Metric SELECT
  rate(sum(container.network.io.usage.rx_bytes), 1 second) / 1024 / 1024 AS 'MB received/sec'
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
FACET container.name
SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

### Correlating container and host metrics

Combine container metrics with host metrics for deeper analysis:

```sql
-- Container resource usage vs host capacity
FROM Metric SELECT
  sum(container.memory.usage.total) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 AS 'Total container memory (GB)',
  latest(system.memory.usage) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 AS 'Host memory used (GB)'
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
FACET host.name
SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

## Creating custom dashboards [#custom-dashboards]

Build comprehensive Docker monitoring dashboards using these query patterns:

1. **Container overview panel**: Show running containers, resource usage, and health status
2. **Resource utilization panels**: Track CPU, memory, network, and storage metrics over time
3. **Alert panels**: Highlight containers exceeding thresholds or experiencing issues
4. **Trend analysis panels**: Show resource usage patterns and capacity planning data

### Example dashboard queries

**Container count by host:**
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(container.name)
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
FACET host.name
SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

**Resource usage heatmap:**
```sql
FROM Metric SELECT average(container.cpu.utilization), average(container.memory.percent)
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
FACET container.name
SINCE 1 hour ago
```
