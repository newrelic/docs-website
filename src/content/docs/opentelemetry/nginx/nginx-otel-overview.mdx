Monitor your NGINX servers using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) to send metrics and telemetry data to New Relic. This integration leverages the OpenTelemetry [nginxreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver) to monitor your NGINX performance metrics, connection statistics, and server health.

### Understanding metric values

**Connection states explained:**
- **Active**: Total number of currently active client connections
- **Reading**: Connections where NGINX is reading the request header
- **Writing**: Connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client
- **Waiting**: Keep-alive connections that are waiting for the next request

**Request metrics interpretation:**
- `nginx.requests` provides total cumulative requests since server start
- Use rate calculations to derive requests per second
- Compare with connection metrics to understand connection efficiency

**Capacity planning insights:**
- High `waiting` connections may indicate keep-alive tuning opportunities
- Gap between `accepted` and `handled` connections suggests resource constraints
- Request-to-connection ratios help optimize worker configurations

For more technical details and implementation examples, see the [NGINX receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/nginxreceiver/documentation.md).
