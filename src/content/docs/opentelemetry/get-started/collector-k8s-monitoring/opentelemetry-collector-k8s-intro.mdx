The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a vendor-agnostic tool for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data. While Collector requirements and configuration will vary, it comes with a variety of receivers and processors which make it popular for Kubernetes monitoring.
Getting all the required telemetry requires scraping various Kubernetes APIs using multiple receivers with differing permission requirements, so to keep things simple for you, we built a helm chart that uses our custom distribution of the collector [nrdot-collector-k8s](https://github.com/newrelic/nrdot-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/nrdot-collector-k8s) under the hood.
For more details on how to get started, please refer to [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel/).
