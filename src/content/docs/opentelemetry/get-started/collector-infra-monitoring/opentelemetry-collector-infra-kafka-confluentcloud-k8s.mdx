You can collect metrics about your Confluent Cloud-managed Kafka deployment with the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

This integration works by running a Prometheus receiver configuration inside the OpenTelemetry collector, which scrapes [Confluent Cloud's metrics API](https://api.telemetry.confluent.cloud/docs/descriptors/datasets/cloud?_ga=2.183807142.1264186867.1705940186-6520871.1686857317&_gl=1*1te8jue*_ga*NjUyMDg3MS4xNjg2ODU3MzE3*_ga_D2D3EGKSGD*MTcwNjAzNzYwOS41Ni4wLjE3MDYwMzc2MDkuNjAuMC4w) and exports that data to New Relic.

## Set up monitoring [#set-up-monitoring]

Complete the steps below to collect Kafka metrics from Confluent and export them to New Relic.

<Steps>
    <Step>
      ### Make sure you're ready to get started [#get-started] 

      Before you start, you need to have the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> for the account you want to report data to. You should also verify that:

      * You have a Kubernetes cluster running
      * (For Helm users) Make sure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) installed
      * You have a [Confluent Cloud account](https://www.confluent.io/get-started/) with a cluster running
      * You have your [Confluent Cloud API key & secret](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/api-key/confluent_api-key_create.html) available

    </Step>
    <Step>
      ### Download or clone the OpenTelemetry tech partner examples repository [#download-repo]

      Download [New Relic's OpenTelemetry tech partnership examples repository](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/tech-partner-opentelemetry-integrations) as this setup uses its example collector configuration. Once installed, open the [Confluent Cloud example](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/tech-partner-opentelemetry-integrations/confluent-cloud) directory. For more information, you can check the `README` there as well.

    </Step>
    <Step>
      ### Run the example [#run-the-example]
    
      Complete either the Helm or Kubernetes instructions below, depending on your environment.
      
      #### Helm example [#run-helm-example]

      1. From the `./confluent-cloud/helm` directory, update the variables in the `values.yaml` file. For more information on the individual variables, see the [local variables](#local-variables) table below.

      2. Run the collector by using the following command:

          ```bash
          # Open the confluent cloud helm example directory
          cd ./confluent-cloud/helm

          # Make sure to set environment variables.

          # Install and run helm
          helm install ./helm
          ```


      #### Kubernetes example [#run-kubernetes-example]

      1. From the `./confluent-cloud/k8s` directory, update the variables in the in the `./k8s/deployment.yaml` file. For more information on the individual variables, see the [local variables](#local-variables) table below.

      2. Once the variables are set, run the following command to apply the collector to your Kubernetes cluster.

          ```bash
          # Open the Confluent Cloud k8s example directory
          cd ./confluent-cloud/k8s

          # Make sure to set environment variables

          # Apply the collector to the cluster
          kubectl apply -f ./k8s
          ```

      ### View your data in New Relic [#view-your-data]

      You can view your Confluent Cloud data in a few different ways.

      * Navigate to the [New Relic marketplace](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) and search for `Confluent`. You can install the available dashboards right onto your account!
      * Navigate to the metrics explorer and filter for `confluent_kafka`. This data can be added to any custom alert or dashboard.
