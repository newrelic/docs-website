The APM experience is available for OpenTelemetry [service entities](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources/#services).
If you haven't configured your service with New Relic and OpenTelemetry, see
[OpenTelemetry APM monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/).

## Find OpenTelemetry APM services [#find-apm-services]

To find OpenTelemetry APM services, navigate to **All entities > Services - OpenTelemetry**
or **APM & Services**. Click on a service to navigate to the service's
[Summary page](#summary-page).

**TODO: How does filtering by entity tags work?**
Within the entity explorer, you can filter by [entity tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/).
For details on how entity tags are computed, see [OpenTelemetry resources in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources).

## APM experience for OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry instrumented services leverage the same curated APM experience as
services instrumented using New Relic's language agents. For this to work,
the OpenTelemetry data you send us is mapped to New Relic conventions. We do
this by generating the metrics required for driving the APM experience. These
generated metrics are directly sourced from your OpenTelemetry data. The
original OpenTelemetry data you've sent is ingested normally and remains
available for your custom dashboarding and alerting needs.

<Callout variant="important">
OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions continue to evolve as many of them are
not yet stable. Therefore, generating metrics normalized to New Relic
conventions reduces the burden on you to determine which version of the
OpenTelemetry conventions are emitted by the instrumentation you're using.

For those who have used our APM language agents, another benefit is that you
can use the metrics and queries you're already familiar as you transition to
OpenTelemetry.
</Callout>

Understanding how OpenTelemetry data is mapped to New Relic conventions is
important for understanding how OpenTelemetry is supported by the APM
experience.

OpenTelemetry data is comprised of metrics, spans, and logs. The APM experience
primarily leverages metric data because OpenTelemetry metrics provides an
accurate representation of the throughput, response time, and error rate of
your services.

<Callout variant="tip">
Our older OpenTelemetry APM experience enabled you to view your data from the
perspective of either metric or span data. Viewing throughput, response time,
and error rate from the perspective of span data can be misleading due to
sampling. This experience is still available for you, but will be phased out
over time. See [Legacy span-based experience]() for more details.
</Callout>

**TODO: Move this callout and other span-synthesis scenarios to a dedicated section**
<Callout variant="important">
OpenTelemetry supports metrics for most languages now, however Ruby is a
notable exception. For Ruby, we perform a best-faith effort to generate New
Relic metrics from span data.
</Callout>

The primary bodies of OpenTelemetry semantic conventions leveraged by the APM
experience are the [HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/),
[RPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/),
[messaging](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/messaging/),
and [database](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/)
conventions.

### How transactions are derived from OpenTelemetry data [#transaction-mapping]

New Relic’s APM experience is centered around the notion of a
[transaction](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/).
When using a New Relic agent, it is the responsibility of the agent’s
instrumentation to define the scope of a transaction (e.g., a single web
request). The agent produces metric data that drives the vast majority of the
New Relic APM experience by recording transaction metrics measuring the
duration of transactions and its individual operations (e.g., external calls
and database calls).

OpenTelemetry instrumentation does not have a direct analog to a New Relic
transaction, so adapting the notion of transactions to OpenTelemetry data is
key.

By leveraging OpenTelemetry’s [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/)
we can take advantage of OpenTelemetry’s highly structured and standardized
means of describing telemetry in order to drive the APM experience in a very
similar way to that of New Relic’s agents.

The semantic conventions define standard metrics for measuring common
operations such as handling [HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-metrics/)
or [RPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/rpc-metrics/)
requests. These metrics are analogous to the transaction metrics that New Relic
agents produce for describing
[Web transactions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/#types).
We leverage OpenTelemetry’s HTTP and RPC metrics to synthesize metrics that
drive the APM UI such as the [`apm.service.transaction.duration` metric](#metric-apm-service-transaction-duration).

New Relic also provides a notion of a
[non-web transaction](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions/).
Non-web transactions are commonly used for systems that perform message
processing. Instrumentation that leverages OpenTelemetry’s [messaging conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/messaging/messaging-spans.md)
will result in synthesizing metrics representing non-web transactions.

<Callout variant="important">
Do to the relative immaturity of OpenTelemetry's messaging conventions compared
to the HTTP and RPC conventions, we currently synthesize non-web transactions
for messaging operations from span data which follow the messaging conventions.
</Callout>

#### Transaction names

Each transaction has a name which is derived from attributes required by
OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions. Refer to the [APM Service Metrics](#apm-service-metrics)
section for how this name is derived.

##### Unknown transaction name

Sometimes you may see a transaction with `unknown` in the name. This is an
indication that the source data used to derive the transaction does not follow
any of the established OpenTelemetry semantic conventions which we currently
support.

Some examples:

* HTTP metrics missing `http.request.method` or `http.route`. For example, if the
  `http.server.request.duration` metric is missing the `http.route` attribute
  then the transaction name will be `WebTransaction/server/GET unknown`.
* Frameworks or protocols for which OpenTelemetry does not currently define
  semantic conventions for (e.g., background jobs and CI frameworks).

## Navigating the APM experience

### Summary [#summary-page]

The [summary page](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/triage-run-diagnostics/)
provides an overview of your service's health and is centered around New
Relic's notion of a [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/).
See [How transactions are derived from OpenTelemetry data](#transaction-mapping) for more details.

The New Relic metrics that drive the Summary page are the
[`apm.service.transaction.duration`](#metric-apm-service-transaction-duration)
and [`apm.service.error.count`](#metric-apm-service-error-count)
metrics. Refer to them for details on how they are derived from your
OpenTelemetry data.

#### Customizing Apdex Target [#customizing-apdex-target]

In New Relic instrumentation, custom apdex targets are configured using agent
configuration. For OpenTelemetry, when viewing a service navigate to
**Settings > Application** to configure your Apdex target.

### Distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing-page]

The distributed tracing page provides detailed insights into OpenTelemetry
trace data. See [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui/)
for page usage information. See [OpenTelemetry traces in New Relic](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-traces)
for details on how OpenTelemetry trace data is ingested into New Relic.

As with [golden signals](#golden-signals), spans are classified as errors if
the span status is set to `ERROR` (for example, `otel.status_code = ERROR`).
If the span is an error, the span status description (for example,
`otel.status_description`) is displayed in **error details**.

OpenTelemetry span events attach additional event context information to a
particular span. They are most commonly used to capture exception information.
If available, you can view a span's events in **trace details**.

<Callout variant="tip">
The presence of a span exception event doesn't qualify the span as an error on
its own. Only spans with span status set to `ERROR` are classified as errors.
</Callout>

/>

### Service map [#service-map-page]

The service map page provides a visual representation of your entire
architecture. See [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/service-maps/)
for more information.

### Transactions [#transactions-page]

The [transactions page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems/)
provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a service's
[transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/#txn-defined).

OpenTelemetry does not have a direct analog to New Relic's notion of a transaction.
See [How transactions are derived from OpenTelemetry data](#transaction-mapping) for more details.

The New Relic metrics that drive the Transaction page are the
[`apm.service.transaction.duration`](#metric-apm-service-transaction-duration)
and [`apm.service.error.count`](#metric-apm-service-error-count)
metrics. Refer to them for details on how they are derived from your
OpenTelemetry data.

For details on the New Relic metric that drives the Transaction page and how it
is derived from your OpenTelemetry data refer to the details of
the [`apm.service.transaction.duration`]() and [`apm.service.error.count`]()
metrics.

#### Transaction traces

[Transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/)
for OpenTelemetry are derived from your span data. On the transactions page you
can find a list of transaction traces. This list requires the span data
and metric data for a given transaction be correlated together. We do this by
adding a `transaction.name` attribute to the root span of a transaction trace.

#### Segment breakdown [#segment-breakdown]

Clicking on a transaction opens a detailed view of the transaction revealing a
segment breakdown. Unlike New Relic agents, OpenTelemetry does not emit metrics
for individual segments. Therefore, the New Relic metrics required for driving
the segment breakdown are derived from span data.

The notable downside to computing segment breakdown from span data is that
spans are usually sampled. Though, even with sampling, the segment breakdown
can still serve to help you identify specific methods or operations that
consume the most time within a transaction.

From span data, we estimate a sampling rate by computing a throughput based on
span data received and divide that by the actual throughput as reported by your
metric data. The estimated sampling rate enables us to extrapolate the segment
breakdown of a transaction.

This process is not perfect and can be affected by a number of factors, most
notably your sampling strategy. It works best when you're strictly sampling
a percentage of your span data. However, for example, if you sample only
spans representing errors, then the segment breakdown may be skewed.

### Databases [#databases-page]

The databases page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a
service's database client operations.

OpenTelemetry instrumentation represents calls to databases using the
[database](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/)
semantic conventions.

The New Relic metric that drives the databases page is the
[`apm.service.datastore.operation.duration`](#metric-apm-service-datastore-operation-duration)
metric. Refer to it for details on how it is derived from your
OpenTelemetry data.

#### Time consumption by caller

When you click on a specific database call, you will see the
"Time consumption by caller" chart. This chart is driven by the
[`apm.service.transaction.overview`](#metric-apm-service-transaction-overview) metric.
This is the same metric that drives the [segment breakdown](#segment-breakdown)
view of the transaction page and it is derived from span data.

<Callout variant="important">
OpenTelemetry's database semantic conventions were recently deemed stable.
There does not yet exist many stable instrumentations, and the instrumentation
that does exist often only emits span data and no metric data.

As such, when using instrumentation that has not yet adopted the stable
semantic conventions, the APM metrics generated driving the database page are
derived from span data.

As stable instrumentation becomes available and you adopt it, the database page
will begin to leverage OpenTelemetry metric data. Reach out to the OpenTelemetry
community regarding the availability of stable database instrumentation in your
language.
</Callout>

### External services [#externals-page]

The [external services page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/external-services/external-services-ui/)
provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing a service's external
calls, including calling entities (upstream services) and called entities
(downstream services).

OpenTelemetry instrumentation represents calls to external services using the
[HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/) and [RPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/)
semantic conventions.

The New Relic metric that drives the databases page is the
[`apm.service.external.host.duration`]()
metric. Refer to it for details on how it is derived from your
OpenTelemetry data.

#### Time consumption by caller

When you click on a specific external call, you will see the
"Time consumption by caller" chart. This chart is driven by the
[`apm.service.transaction.overview`](#metric-apm-service-transaction-overview) metric.
This is the same metric that drives the [segment breakdown](#segment-breakdown)
view of the transaction page and it is derived from span data.

### JVM runtime [#jvm-runtime-page]

The JVM runtime page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing
a Java service's JVM. The page is only displayed for services using [OpenTelemetry Java](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/).
In order to differentiate between distinct service instances, the page requires
the `service.instance.id` resource attribute to be set (see
[Services](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources/#services)
for more details).

The JVM runtime page shows golden signals alongside JVM runtime metrics to
correlate runtime issues with service usage.

The queries assume data conforms to the [JVM metric](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/jvm-metrics/)
semantic conventions. Note, these conventions are embodied in
[OpenTelemetry Java runtime instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime-telemetry/runtime-telemetry-java8/library),
which is automatically included with the OpenTelemetry java agent.

### Go runtime [#go-runtime-page]

The Go runtime page provides tools for identifying problems with and analyzing
a Go service's runtime. The page is only displayed for services using [OpenTelemetry Go](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/).
In order to differentiate between distinct service instances, the page requires
the `service.instance.id` resource attribute to be set (see [Services](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources/#services)
for more details).

The Go runtime page shows golden signals alongside Go runtime metrics to
correlate runtime issues with service usage.

The queries assume data is produced by the [OpenTelemetry Go runtime instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime).
Note, there are currently no semantic conventions for Go runtime metrics.

### Logs [#logs-page]

The Logs page provides tools for identifying problems and analyzing a service's
logs. See [Use logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) for more information.

### Errors inbox [#errors-inbox-page]

The errors inbox page provides tools for detecting and triaging a service's
errors. See [Getting started with errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/getting-started/)
for more details.

The errors inbox page is driven by trace data. As with [golden signals](#golden-signals),
spans are classified as errors if the span status is set to `ERROR` (for
example, `otel.status_code = ERROR`).

Error spans are grouped together by their error fingerprint, computed by
normalizing away identifying values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses,
etc. Each distinct error span is an individual instance within the error group.
The error group message is determined as follows:

* Span status description (for example, `otel.status_description`)
* `rpc.grpc.status_code` from [RPC span](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/rpc-spans/) semantic conventions
* `http.status_code` from [HTTP span](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/) semantic conventions
* `http.response.status_code` from [HTTP span](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/) semantic conventions
* `undefined` if none of the above are present

## APM Service Metrics

The apm.service.\* metrics drive New Relic’s APM experience. The following
describes the source OpenTelemetry data that is used to derive the
corresponding apm.service.\* metrics.

### Metric: `apm.service.transaction.duration` [#metric-apm-service-transaction-duration]

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host.name` | string | Copied from the `host.name` resource attribute. |
| `service.name` | string | Copied from the `service.name` resource attribute. |
| `service.instance.id` | string | Copied from the `service.instance.id` resource attribute. |

### Metric: `apm.service.error.count` [#metric-apm-service-error-count]

### Metric: `apm.service.external.host.duration` [#metric-apm-service-external-host-duration]

### Metric: `apm.service.datastore.operation.duration` [#metric-apm-servic-datastore-operation-duration]

### Metric: `apm.service.transaction.overview` [#metric-apm-service-transaction-overview]

## Golden signals [#golden-signals]

The golden signals of throughput, response time, and error rate appear in several places throughout the OpenTelemetry APM UI. When used, they are computed as follows:

For metrics, the queries assume data conforms to the [HTTP metric](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-metrics/) or [RPC metric](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/rpc-metrics/) semantic conventions.

For spans, the queries are generic, utilizing only the top level span data model. Spans are counted towards throughput and response time if they are root entry spans into a service, computed using a heuristic of `WHERE span.kind = server OR span.kind = consumer`. Spans are errors if they have a status code of `ERROR` (for example, `otel.status_code = ERROR`).

## Narrow data with filters [#narrow-with-filters]

Several pages include a filter bar, with options like **Narrow data to...**. This allows you to filter queries on the page to match the criteria. For example, you might narrow to a particular canary deployment by filtering for `service.version='1.2.3-canary'`. Filters are preserved when navigating between pages.

## Golden metrics
Golden metrics are low-cardinality versions of golden signals data, such as HTTP/RPC metrics. They populate various platform experiences, including the Entity Explorer, Workloads Activity page, and Change Tracking Details page. These metrics use names like `newrelic.goldenmetrics.ext.service.*`.

<Callout variant="important">
Historically, the OpenTelemetry golden metrics were calculated from spans. Spans are usually sampled, so they only provide a partial picture. Now that metrics are broadly available, golden metrics are calculated using metrics data rather than span data.
</Callout>
