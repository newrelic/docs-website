The Adaptive Telemetry Processor (ATP) is an intelligent metric filtering processor for the New Relic Distribution for OpenTelemetry (NRDOT) Collector. ATP dynamically monitors system and process metrics, filtering out low-value telemetry based on configurable thresholds while preserving critical visibility during performance events.

## Why ATP matters

Effective infrastructure monitoring requires the right balance between visibility and cost. Traditional monitoring approaches create several challenges:

* **Data overload**: High-volume telemetry data from all processes increases costs without proportional value
* **Visibility gaps**: Stateless filtering creates "data gaps" where processes constantly appear and disappear from telemetry as they fluctuate around thresholds
* **Lack of context**: Important processes may be missed during brief but critical resource spikes
* **Manual tuning**: Static thresholds require constant adjustment as system conditions change

## What is ATP

ATP solves these challenges through an intelligent, stateful approach to telemetry processing. Instead of simple threshold-based filtering, ATP combines:

* **Process-based sampling**: Monitor specific processes by name (e.g., `nginx`, `java`, `postgres`)
* **Multi-metric composite scoring**: Combine multiple metrics with configurable weights for holistic assessment
* **Dynamic threshold adjustment**: Automatically adapt thresholds based on historical baselines
* **Anomaly detection**: Detect sudden metric changes and preserve anomalous data
* **Persistent state management**: Maintain context across collector restarts via JSON file
* **Low overhead**: `<2%` CPU impact, 10-50MB RAM usage

## What ATP offers

### Significant data reduction with maintained visibility
* **Up to 70% reduction in data ingestion** while keeping more context-aware data
* **Eliminates data gaps** that traditional stateless filtering creates
* **Preserves critical context** through configurable retention periods

### Two-phase evolution
ATP delivers value through a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Stateful retention strategy**
   - Threshold-based tracking with persistent state
   - Configurable retention periods (default: 60 minutes)
   - Persistent storage across collector restarts

2. **Phase 2: Fully intelligent adaptive system**
   - Dynamic thresholds that adapt to system load
   - Multi-metric evaluation using composite scoring
   - Anomaly detection for sudden usage spikes

### Enterprise-ready features
* **Lightweight storage**: Requires only 5-10MB of storage for tracking state
* **Restart resilience**: Maintains tracking context across collector restarts
* **Configurable behavior**: Customizable thresholds, retention periods, and weights
* **Universal compatibility**: Works with any resource type

## How it works

ATP processes telemetry data through an intelligent filtering system:

1. **Process identification**: Monitors all processes for resource usage patterns
2. **Threshold evaluation**: Compares current usage against configured or dynamic thresholds  
3. **Retention tracking**: Maintains state for processes that exceed thresholds
4. **Intelligent sampling**: Applies advanced logic including anomaly detection and multi-metric evaluation
5. **Data forwarding**: Sends only relevant telemetry data to New Relic

This approach ensures you capture critical process behavior while dramatically reducing data volume and associated costs.
