The Adaptive Telemetry Processor (ATP) is an evolutionary framework designed to optimize resource monitoring at scale. Built on  New Relic Distribution for OpenTelemetry (NRDOT), ATP intelligently reduces telemetry data volume while maintaining critical visibility into your infrastructure.

## Why ATP matters

Effective infrastructure monitoring requires the right balance between visibility and cost. Traditional monitoring approaches create several challenges:

* **Data overload**: High-volume telemetry data from all processes increases costs without proportional value
* **Visibility gaps**: Stateless filtering creates "data gaps" where processes constantly appear and disappear from telemetry as they fluctuate around thresholds
* **Lack of context**: Important processes may be missed during brief but critical resource spikes
* **Manual tuning**: Static thresholds require constant adjustment as system conditions change

## What is ATP

ATP solves these challenges through an intelligent, stateful approach to telemetry processing. Instead of simple threshold-based filtering, ATP combines:

* **Stateful retention**: Once a process becomes important, it stays visible for a configurable period
* **Intelligent adaptation**: Dynamic thresholds adjust based on system conditions
* **Multi-dimensional evaluation**: Considers multiple resource types (CPU, memory) together
* **Anomaly detection**: Captures sudden behavioral changes that indicate potential issues

## What ATP offers

### Significant data reduction with maintained visibility
* **~80% reduction in data ingestion** while keeping more context-aware data
* **Eliminates data gaps** that traditional stateless filtering creates
* **Preserves critical context** through configurable retention periods

### Two-phase evolution
ATP delivers value through a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Stateful retention strategy**
   - Threshold-based tracking with persistent state
   - Configurable retention periods (default: 60 minutes)
   - Persistent storage across collector restarts

2. **Phase 2: Fully intelligent adaptive system**
   - Dynamic thresholds that adapt to system load
   - Multi-metric evaluation using composite scoring
   - Anomaly detection for sudden usage spikes

### Enterprise-ready features
* **Lightweight storage**: Requires only 5-10MB of storage for tracking state
* **Restart resilience**: Maintains tracking context across collector restarts
* **Configurable behavior**: Customizable thresholds, retention periods, and weights
* **Universal compatibility**: Works with any resource type

## How it works

ATP processes telemetry data through an intelligent filtering system:

1. **Process identification**: Monitors all processes for resource usage patterns
2. **Threshold evaluation**: Compares current usage against configured or dynamic thresholds  
3. **Retention tracking**: Maintains state for processes that exceed thresholds
4. **Intelligent sampling**: Applies advanced logic including anomaly detection and multi-metric evaluation
5. **Data forwarding**: Sends only relevant telemetry data to New Relic

This approach ensures you capture critical process behavior while dramatically reducing data volume and associated costs.
