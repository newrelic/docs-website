New Relic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (NRODT) refers to the collection of New Relic-supported distributions of OpenTelemetry project components.
NRDOT components are designed to work seamlessly with New Relic products and services, and when available, are the recommended way to integrate OpenTelemetry with New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
Currently, NRDOT includes pre-built distributions of the OpenTelemetry [Collector](/docs/opentelemetry/nrdot/nrdot-collector/), for language APIs and SDKs see our docs on getting started with [APM monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/).
