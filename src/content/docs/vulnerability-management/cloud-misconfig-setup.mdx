Security RX Cloud provides a unified security and posture management solution to streamline the discovery, management, and remediation process for cloud security findings. This guide walks you through setting up the integration with AWS Security Hub.

## Overview

Security RX Cloud uses a **polling integration** with AWS Security Hub, which is different from the existing webhook-based integration. This polling method allows for more comprehensive data collection and better integration with New Relic's auto-discovery capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Security RX Cloud, ensure you have:

* A New Relic account with Security RX access and appropriate user permissions
* An AWS account with [AWS Security Hub enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html)
* Appropriate IAM permissions for the integration
* A New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) for the account you want to report data to

## Connect your AWS account

There are two setup paths depending on whether you're a new user or already have an existing AWS integration with New Relic.

### For new users

If you're connecting your AWS account to New Relic for the first time:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Navigate to the integration setup

    1. From the New Relic platform, navigate to **Infrastructure > AWS**
    2. Click **Add an AWS account** and follow the guided instructions
    3. For detailed guidance on the API polling integration, see our [AWS integration documentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-aws-api-polling/)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Choose Security Hub Configuration

    1. During the setup process, you'll see integration options including **Security Hub Configuration**
    2. Select **Security Hub Configuration** to enable cloud security monitoring
    3. Choose your preferred setup method:
       * **CloudFormation** (recommended for most users)
       * **Manual integration** (for custom configurations)
       * **Terraform** (for infrastructure as code workflows)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure auto-discovery

    1. When prompted, enable auto-discovery to automatically identify cloud resources
    2. Select the AWS regions you want to monitor
    3. Choose your polling frequency:
       * **6 hours** (more frequent updates)
       * **12 hours** (standard frequency)
    4. Save your configuration
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Complete the setup

    1. Follow the remaining guided setup steps
    2. If using CloudFormation, launch the provided template in your AWS account
    3. Verify the integration is working by checking for incoming data
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For existing AWS integration users

If you already have an AWS account connected to New Relic:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Access integration management

    1. Navigate to **Infrastructure > AWS**
    2. Find your existing AWS account integration
    3. Click **Manage AWS Integration**
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install Security Hub integration

    1. Look for **AWS Security Hub** in the available integrations list
    2. If not already configured, you'll see an **Install** button
    3. Click **Install** to begin the setup process
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure Security Hub settings

    1. Select your polling frequency (6 or 12 hours)
    2. Choose which AWS regions to monitor
    3. Save your configuration
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install auto-discovery (optional but recommended)

    1. Look for **AWS Auto Discovery** in the integration list
    2. If not already enabled, click **Install**
    3. Configure regional settings and scanning frequency
    4. Save the auto-discovery configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How auto-discovery works with SRX Cloud

Security RX Cloud is built to leverage New Relic's core platform capabilities through auto-discovery:

### Resource identification

When you connect your AWS account and enable auto-discovery, our system:

* Automatically identifies all your cloud resources (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, etc.)
* Brings them into New Relic as monitored entities
* Fetches live configuration data for these resources

### Security enrichment

Security RX Cloud then enhances these entities by:

* Enriching them with security findings from AWS Security Hub
* Providing contextual information about misconfigurations
* Displaying current resource configuration alongside proposed remediation steps

This integration makes it easy to see exactly what's wrong with a resource and how the proposed fix will correct it.

## Integration with CSPM vendors

### AWS Security Hub options

Security RX Cloud integrates with AWS Security Hub, which can aggregate findings from multiple security tools:

* **AWS native services**: GuardDuty, Inspector, Config, etc.
* **Third-party CSPM tools**: Any tool that publishes findings to Security Hub
* **Custom security findings**: Your own security tools that integrate with Security Hub

### Understanding the golden path

For optimal outcomes with Security RX Cloud:

1. **Enable AWS Security Hub** as your central security findings aggregator
2. **Configure your preferred CSPM tools** to publish findings to Security Hub
3. **Use auto-discovery** to ensure all resources are monitored and contextualized
4. **Set appropriate polling frequency** based on your security requirements

## Troubleshooting common setup issues

### Integration not showing data

If you don't see security findings after setup:

* Verify AWS Security Hub is enabled in your monitored regions
* Check that your IAM permissions include Security Hub read access
* Confirm that security findings exist in AWS Security Hub
* Wait for the next polling cycle (up to 12 hours depending on your settings)

### Auto-discovery not finding resources

If resources aren't being discovered:

* Verify auto-discovery is enabled for the correct regions
* Check IAM permissions for EC2, S3, RDS, and other service read access
* Ensure resources exist in the monitored regions
* Wait for the next discovery scan

### Performance considerations

* Choose polling frequency based on your security response requirements
* Monitor usage to ensure you're within your New Relic data limits
* Consider regional scope to focus on your most critical environments

## Next steps

After completing the integration setup:

* Review the [cloud misconfiguration prioritization guide](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-misconfig-prioritization) to understand how findings are scored
* Learn about [remediation workflows](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-misconfig-remediation) for fixing misconfigurations
* Choose your workflow based on your role:
  * [Workflow for engineers](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-workflow-misconfig)
  * [Workflow for security teams](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow-cloud-misconfig)
