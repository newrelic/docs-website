Security RX for Applications helps you identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities in your application dependencies. Whether you're monitoring a single service or managing security across your entire application portfolio, Security RX provides the visibility and context you need to secure your software supply chain.

## What you can do

With Security RX for Applications, you can:

* **Detect vulnerabilities** in application dependencies automatically through APM agents
* **Prioritize remediation** based on CVSS severity, exploit probability (EPSS), and active ransomware campaigns
* **Track vulnerability exposure** across your application portfolio
* **Monitor specific applications** with entity-scoped views for developers
* **Manage organization-wide security** with comprehensive dashboards for security teams
* **Import vulnerabilities** from third-party tools like Snyk, Dependabot, and FOSSA

## How to get started

Before using Security RX for Applications, make sure you have:

1. **[Set up prerequisites and user roles](/docs/vulnerability-management/getting-started/prerequisites)** - Ensure you have the required permissions
2. **[Configured an integration](/docs/vulnerability-management/getting-started/integrations/overview)** - Install an APM agent or set up a third-party integration
3. **[Understand prioritization](/docs/vulnerability-management/getting-started/prioritization)** - Learn how vulnerabilities are ranked

## Choose your workflow

Security RX provides two complementary views for managing application vulnerabilities:

### Organization view: Manage all applications

Best for security teams, DevSecOps, and platform engineers who need to:
- Calculate the vulnerability surface area across all applications
- Identify which applications pose the highest risk
- Understand how vulnerabilities affect multiple services
- Track security hygiene metrics organization-wide

**→ [Manage organization-wide application vulnerabilities](/docs/vulnerability-management/applications/manage-organization-vulnerabilities)**

### Entity view: Monitor specific applications

Best for developers and engineers who need to:
- Monitor vulnerabilities in services they own
- Prioritize fixes for a specific application
- Track vulnerability exposure windows for their code
- Integrate security tasks into their daily workflow

**→ [Monitor entity-level application security](/docs/vulnerability-management/applications/monitor-entity-security)**

## Supported languages and frameworks

Security RX detects vulnerabilities in applications instrumented with New Relic APM agents:

| Language | Minimum Version | Detection Coverage |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Java | All supported versions | JAR files |
| Node.js | All supported versions | npm packages |
| Ruby | All supported versions | Gems |
| Python | 8.0 or higher | Packages |
| Go | 3.20 or higher | Modules |
| PHP | 10.17 or higher | Composer packages |

For complete agent requirements and version details, see [APM agent integrations](/docs/vulnerability-management/getting-started/integrations/overview#apm-agents).

## Data sources

Security RX for Applications collects vulnerability data from:

* **APM agents** - Automatic detection of vulnerabilities in loaded libraries
* **Third-party integrations** - Import findings from Snyk, Dependabot, FOSSA, and other security tools
* **Security data API** - Send custom vulnerability data directly to New Relic
