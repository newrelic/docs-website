metaDescription: Change application vulnerability status to Ignored, Affected, or Fixed to track remediation progress in Security RX.

New Relic Security RX can detect vulnerabilities across your applications. While most vulnerabilities need remediation, some might not be applicable to your environment. For example, your internal policies might categorize them as low risk or limited exposure due to how your application uses the potentially vulnerable component.

For vulnerabilities you're not interested in tracking, you can set the **Status** to **Ignored** so they no longer appear in the UI. Since each vulnerability is tied to one or more applications, you can:

* Ignore individual vulnerabilities for a specific application
* Ignore a vulnerability that appears across multiple applications

You can always change the status from **Ignored** back to **Affected** if you decide a vulnerability is worth tracking again.

## Ignore a vulnerability [#ignore-vulnerability]

When you choose to ignore a vulnerability, you'll be prompted to explain the rationale behind the decision. For example, you might say that the vulnerable code is not used in the application. We recommend that when you give this context, you also provide supplemental documentation when possible.

You'll also be prompted to set a duration for the **Ignored** status. Security RX will automatically change it from **Ignored** to **Affected** when the time period expires. If a vulnerability is already **No Longer Detected**, the status will remain no longer detected.

    You can manually ignore vulnerabilities for specific applications. Once you set the status to **Ignored**, we'll exclude this from the summary tiles and vulnerability list by default. Other instances of this vulnerability on other applications will still keep the **Affected** status.

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > APM & services > (select an application)**</DNT>
    2. In the left navigation, select <DNT>**Security RX**</DNT>
    3. Click the <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT> tab
    4. Select the vulnerability you want to ignore. If you don't see it, it might already have the **Ignored** status
    5. Click the <DNT>**Change to ignored**</DNT> button
    6. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability, including a time period

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Security RX > Applications**</DNT>
    2. Click the <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT> tab. By default, this view filters to vulnerabilities where at least one application is marked **Affected**
    3. Choose the vulnerability you want to ignore
    4. In the **Area of Impact** section, select each application you want to ignore
    5. Click the <DNT>**Change to ignored**</DNT> button
    6. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability, including a time period

## Restore ignored vulnerabilities [#restore-ignored]

It's good practice to review ignored vulnerabilities and validate whether they should stay ignored. We recommend reviewing your vulnerabilities every 90 days to ensure you aren't introducing risk into your system.

If you change the status from **Ignored** to **Affected** for a specific application, that reintroduces the vulnerability into default views and counts against this application. Instances of this vulnerability on other applications remain ignored.

    2. In the left navigation, select <DNT>**Security RX**</DNT>
    3. Click the <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT> tab
    4. Update the filter from **Status = Affected** to **Status = Ignored**. This displays all ignored vulnerabilities
    5. Choose the vulnerability you want to update
    6. Click <DNT>**Change to affected**</DNT>
    7. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to **Affected**

    3. From the settings cog, click the **Ignored** checkbox. This adds an ignore column to your vulnerability table
    4. Select a vulnerability with an **Ignored** count greater than 0
    5. Update the filter from **Status = Affected** to **Status = Ignored**
    6. In the **Area of Impact** section, select the applications you want to mark **Affected**
    7. Click <DNT>**Change to affected**</DNT>
