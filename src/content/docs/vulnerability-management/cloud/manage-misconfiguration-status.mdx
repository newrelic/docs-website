title: Manage cloud misconfiguration status
metaDescription: Change cloud misconfiguration status to Ignored, Affected, or Fixed to track remediation progress in Security RX Cloud.

New Relic Security RX Cloud can detect misconfigurations across your cloud resources. While most misconfigurations need remediation, some might not be applicable to your environment. For example, your internal policies might categorize them as low risk or limited exposure due to how your cloud resources are configured or used.

For misconfigurations you're not interested in tracking, you can set the **Status** to **Ignored** so they no longer appear in the UI. Since each misconfiguration is tied to one or more cloud resources, you can:

* Ignore individual misconfigurations for a specific resource
* Ignore a misconfiguration that appears across multiple resources

You can always change the status from **Ignored** back to **Affected** if you decide a misconfiguration is worth tracking again.

  Before you ignore a misconfiguration, keep in mind that this change prevents other users with account access from seeing that misconfiguration.

## Ignore a misconfiguration [#ignore-misconfiguration]

When you choose to ignore a misconfiguration, you'll be prompted to explain the rationale behind the decision. For example, you might say that the resource is not exposed to the internet or that compensating controls are in place. We recommend that when you give this context, you also provide supplemental documentation when possible.

You'll also be prompted to set a duration for the **Ignored** status. Security RX Cloud will automatically change it from **Ignored** to **Affected** when the time period expires. If a misconfiguration is already **No Longer Detected**, the status will remain no longer detected.

    You can manually ignore misconfigurations for specific resources. Once you set the status to **Ignored**, we'll exclude this from the summary tiles and misconfiguration list by default. Other instances of this misconfiguration on other resources will still keep the **Affected** status.

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Security RX > Cloud**</DNT>
    2. Click the <DNT>**Misconfigurations**</DNT> tab
    3. Select the misconfiguration you want to review
    4. In the **Area of Impact** section, find the specific resource you want to ignore
    5. Select the resource
    6. Click the <DNT>**Change to ignored**</DNT> button
    7. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this misconfiguration, including a time period

    2. Click the <DNT>**Misconfigurations**</DNT> tab. By default, this view filters to misconfigurations where at least one resource is marked **Affected**
    3. Choose the misconfiguration you want to ignore
    4. In the **Area of Impact** section, select each resource you want to ignore
    5. Click the <DNT>**Change to ignored**</DNT> button

## Restore ignored misconfigurations [#restore-ignored]

It's good practice to review ignored misconfigurations and validate whether they should stay ignored. We recommend reviewing your misconfigurations every 90 days to ensure you aren't introducing risk into your cloud environment.

If you change the status from **Ignored** to **Affected** for a specific resource, that reintroduces the misconfiguration into default views and counts against this resource. Instances of this misconfiguration on other resources remain ignored.
