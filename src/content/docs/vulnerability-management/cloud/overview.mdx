Security RX Cloud provides a unified security and posture management solution to streamline the discovery, management, and remediation process for cloud security findings. By integrating with AWS Security Hub, you can automatically synchronize findings and reduce context switching between multiple security tools.

With Security RX Cloud, you get:

* **Unified security view**: Aggregate findings from AWS Security Hub, including GuardDuty, Inspector, Config, and third-party CSPM tools
* **Intelligent prioritization**: Advanced risk scoring that considers severity, threat indicators, asset criticality, and public exposure
* **Contextual remediation**: Live configuration data alongside proposed fixes for clear understanding
* **Auto-discovery integration**: Automatic identification of all cloud resources with security enrichment

## Why Security RX Cloud?

Cloud environments often generate hundreds or thousands of security findings, making it impossible to address everything at once. Security RX Cloud solves critical challenges:

* **Reduce alert fatigue**: Focus on the most critical security issues first with intelligent prioritization
* **Eliminate context switching**: View security findings alongside resource configuration in one platform
* **Accelerate remediation**: Access detailed remediation guidance for Console, CLI, and Infrastructure as Code workflows
* **Improve security posture**: Track trends and understand your cloud security over time

## How Security RX Cloud works

Security RX Cloud leverages New Relic's core platform capabilities:

1. **Connect your AWS account**: Set up polling integration with AWS Security Hub
2. **Enable auto-discovery**: Automatically identify all cloud resources (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
3. **Security enrichment**: Enhance entities with security findings from AWS Security Hub
4. **Prioritize and remediate**: Use intelligent risk scoring to focus on critical issues
