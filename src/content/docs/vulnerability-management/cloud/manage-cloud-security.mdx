Security RX Cloud helps you discover, prioritize, and remediate cloud misconfigurations by integrating with AWS Security Hub. Whether you're an engineer focused on tactical remediation or a security team member managing organization-wide cloud security posture, you'll use the same comprehensive interface with different focuses.

This document covers how to:

* **For engineers**: Improve cloud security posture in real-time, access detailed remediation guidance, and integrate security fixes into development workflows
* **For security teams**: Gain organization-wide visibility, coordinate remediation efforts across teams, track progress, and communicate risk to stakeholders

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* [Security RX Cloud integration set up](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud/setup) with your AWS account(s)
* AWS Security Hub enabled in your monitored regions
* Access to Security RX in your New Relic account
* For organization-wide visibility: Security RX Cloud configured across all AWS accounts

## Access Security RX Cloud

Navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Security RX > Cloud**</DNT> to access your cloud security dashboard.

Unlike application and infrastructure views which have individual entity pages, cloud resources are accessed through the central Security RX Cloud interface. This unified approach provides comprehensive visibility across your entire cloud environment.

## Understand your cloud security overview [#overview]

The **Cloud** tab provides a comprehensive dashboard that helps you contextualize findings, identify top risk areas, and understand trends across your cloud environment.

### Problems the overview solves

* **Overwhelming misconfiguration volume**: Large numbers of findings make it difficult to understand trends and prioritize efforts
* **Lack of visibility**: No clear starting point for remediation efforts
* **Fragmented security view**: No single view across multiple AWS accounts and regions
* **Stakeholder reporting**: Need for executive-level insights into security posture

### Key overview features

The cloud overview page displays:

* **New misconfigurations**: Recently detected security findings requiring attention
* **Top critical regions**: Geographic areas with the highest concentration of security issues
* **Top resource types**: Which AWS services (S3, EC2, RDS, etc.) have the most security findings
* **Risk breakdown by category**: Misconfigurations organized by security impact type
* **Risk by account**: Multi-account view showing which AWS accounts need the most attention
* **Critical VPC analysis**: Virtual private cloud environments with security concerns

### Interpreting misconfiguration data

The overview helps you:

* **Assess exposure over time**: Track whether your security posture is improving or degrading
* **View by category**: Understand whether you're dealing with compliance issues, active threats, or configuration drift
* **Distinguish standards vs threats**: Differentiate between compliance violations and active security threats
* **Breakdown by dimensions**: Filter by issue type, resource type, region, or cloud account for focused analysis

## Prioritize and search cloud misconfigurations [#prioritize-search]

After understanding your overall security posture, dive deeper into specific misconfigurations using the detailed views.

### Access misconfiguration details

Navigate to the **Misconfigurations** section within Security RX Cloud to view all detected security findings:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Security RX > Cloud**</DNT>
2. Select the **Misconfigurations** tab for a detailed list view

### Filter and sort misconfigurations

Use the filtering and sorting capabilities to focus on what matters most:

* **Sort by risk level**: Focus on critical and high-severity findings first
* **Filter by resource type**: View misconfigurations for specific services (S3, EC2, RDS, etc.)
* **Sort by detection time**: See the most recently discovered issues
* **Filter by region**: Focus on specific AWS regions
* **Filter by account**: Multi-account environments can filter by specific AWS accounts

### Resource-level analysis

Use the **Resources** tab to understand security issues from a resource perspective:

  alt="Screenshot of the Security RX Resources dashboard showing cloud resources breakdown by misconfigurations and severity"
  src="/images/security-rx-resources-dashboard.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The Resources view provides a comprehensive breakdown of cloud resources organized by security posture and ownership.
</figcaption>

Key capabilities:

* **Contextualize severity profiles**: See how many critical, high, medium, and low findings each resource has
* **Prioritize remediation efforts**: Focus on resources with multiple high-severity findings
* **Understand blast radius**: See which resources are most critical to your infrastructure
* **Entity ownership mapping**: Associate cloud resources with responsible teams through tagging and metadata

## For engineers: Triage and remediate misconfigurations [#engineer-remediation]

When you've identified a misconfiguration to address, click on it to access detailed information and remediation guidance.

### Problems this workflow solves

* **Remediation overwhelm**: Not knowing where to start when facing hundreds of misconfigurations
* **Difficulty assessing impact**: Hard to understand the true risk and affected area of a misconfiguration
* **Research overhead**: Time wasted looking up how to fix security issues
* **Context switching**: Having to leave New Relic to research and implement fixes

### Understanding misconfiguration details

Each misconfiguration detail page provides:

* **Risk assessment**: Why this misconfiguration matters and its potential impact
* **Affected resources**: Complete list of resources with this security finding
* **Resource context**: Current configuration, team ownership, tags, and operational metrics
* **Remediation guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for multiple workflows

### Access remediation instructions

Security RX Cloud provides comprehensive, AI-generated remediation playbooks with multiple workflow options:

* **Console**: Step-by-step instructions for fixing the issue in the AWS Management Console
* **CLI**: Copy-pasteable AWS CLI commands with explanations
* **CloudFormation**: Production-ready Infrastructure as Code snippets
* **Terraform**: Terraform code snippets for infrastructure automation
* **Verification**: Post-fix checklist to confirm the issue is resolved

### Best practices for engineers

* **Start with critical findings**: Focus on high-risk misconfigurations that could lead to data exposure
* **Use Infrastructure as Code fixes**: Prefer CloudFormation or Terraform remediation to prevent configuration drift
* **Verify fixes**: Always run the verification steps to ensure the misconfiguration is truly resolved
* **Update your templates**: Apply fixes to your infrastructure code templates to prevent recurrence

### Integration with development workflow

Security RX Cloud is designed to fit into your existing development and operational processes:

* **CI/CD integration**: Use the remediation code snippets in your infrastructure pipelines

* **Regular maintenance**: Use the overview dashboard for regular security hygiene reviews
* **Team collaboration**: Share misconfiguration details and remediation plans with team members

## For security teams: Coordinate organization-wide remediation [#security-coordination]

Security teams need to coordinate remediation efforts across multiple development and operations teams while tracking progress and ensuring accountability.

### Problems this workflow solves

* **Resource allocation**: Uncertainty about where to focus security team efforts for maximum impact
* **Remediation assignment**: Difficulty assigning security findings to the right teams and individuals
* **Progress tracking**: No visibility into whether assigned remediation work is being completed
* **Team collaboration**: Challenges coordinating between security, development, and operations teams
* **Escalation management**: Unclear processes for handling overdue or critical security findings

### Key metrics for security leaders

The cloud overview provides executive-level insights including:

* **Total misconfiguration count**: Overall volume and trends over time
* **Risk distribution**: Breakdown of critical, high, medium, and low-risk findings
* **Account-level analysis**: Which AWS accounts pose the highest risk
* **Regional distribution**: Geographic concentration of security issues
* **Resource type analysis**: Which AWS services require the most attention
* **Compliance posture**: Standards-based findings vs. active threat indicators
