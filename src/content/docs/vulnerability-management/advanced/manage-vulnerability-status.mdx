## About status management

All Security RX platforms support changing the status of security findings to help you track remediation progress:

* **Affected**: The finding is active and requires attention (default status)
* **Ignored**: The finding is not applicable to your environment and should be hidden from views
* **Fixed**: The finding has been remediated (automatically set when no longer detected)

When you ignore a finding, you can:
* Provide a rationale for the decision
* Set a duration for the ignored status
* Apply the status change to a single entity or across multiple entities

For detailed instructions specific to your platform, refer to the appropriate guide above.
