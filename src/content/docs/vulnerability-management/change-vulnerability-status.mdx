New Relic Vulnerability Management can detect a number of vulnerabilities across your system. While most of these vulnerabilities may need remediation, some might be not be applicable to your environment. For example, your internal policies might categorize them as low risk or limited exposure due to how your systems leverage the potentially vulnerable component.

For vulnerabilities you're not interested in, you can set the **Status** to **Ignored** so they no longer appear in the UI. Since each vulnerability is tied to one or more [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#what-is-entity), you can do the following:

* Ignore individual vulnerabilities for an entity
* Ignore a vulnerability that appears across multiple entities

You can always change the status from **Ignored** back to **Affected** if you decide a vulnerability is worth tracking again.

## Ignore a vulnerability [#ignore-vulnerability]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Before you ignore a vulnerability, keep in mind that this change prevents other users with account access from seeing that vulnerability.
</Callout>

When you choose to ignore a vulnerability, you'll be prompted to explain the rationale behind the decision. For example, you might say that the vulnerable code is not used in the system and isn't currently relevant. We recommend that when you give this context, you also provide supplemental documentation when possible.

We'll also prompt you to set a duration for the **Ignored** status. Vulnerability Management will perform an automatic update that changes it from **Ignored** to **Affected** when the time period is up. If a vulnerability is already considered **No Longer Detected**, the status will remain no longer detected.

    You can manually ignore vulnerabilities for specific entities. Once you set the status of a vulnerability to **Ignored**, weâ€™ll exclude this from the summary tiles and vulnerability list by default. Other instances of this vulnerability on other entities will still keep the **Affected** status.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All entities > (select your entity) > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab, and then select the vulnerability you want to ignore. If you don't see the vulnerability you want to manage, it might already have the **Ignored** status.

         src="/images/security_screenshot-ignore-entity-vulnlist.webp"
       />

    2. To update the status to **Ignored**, click the **Change to ignored** button.

       <img
         title="Vulnerability instance details pages"
         alt="An image showing the change to ignored button on vulnerability instance details page"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-ignore-entity-details.webp"
       />

    3. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability. Include a time period that the vulnerability should be ignored.

       <img
         title="Vulnerability instance details form"
         alt="An image showing the ignore form on vulnerability instance details page"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-ignore-entity-form.webp"
       />
  </Collapser>

    title="Ignore a vulnerability across multiple entities"
  >
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab, then choose the vulnerability you want to ignore. By default, this view filters to vulnerabilities where at least one entity is marked **Affected**.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities tab for all entities"
         alt="An image showing the all entities vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-ignore-bulk-vulnlist.webp"
       />

    2. Referring to **Area of Impact**, select each entity you want to ignore, then click the **Change to ignored** button.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities details"
         alt="An image showing the selection of specific entities"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-ignore-bulk-details.webp"
       />

    3. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind ignoring this vulnerability. Include a time period that the vulnerability should be ignored.

       <img

## Restore ignored vulnerabilities [#bulk-manage]

It's good practice to review ignored vulnerabilities and validate whether they should stay ignored. We recommend that you review your vulnerabilities every 90 days to ensure you aren't introducing risk into your system.

If you change the status from **Ignored** to **Affected** for a specific entity, that reintroduces the vulnerability into default views and counts against this entity. Instances of this vulnerability on other entities remain ignored.

To find ignored vulnerabilities to see if you want to track them again, follow the instructions below:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="remove-ignored"
    title="Remove ignored status for a specific entity"
  >
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All entities > (select the entity you want to update) > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab.

    2. Update the filter from **Status = Affected** to **Status = Ignored**. This updates the default **Affected** view to instead display all the ignored vulnerabilities.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity"
         alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management with filter tab open"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-entity-vulnlist.webp"
       />

    3. Choose the vulnerability that you want to update, then click **Change to affected**.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities tab scoped to a specific entity and only ignored instances"
         alt="An image showing the scoped vulnerabilities tab of Vulnerability Management filtered to only ignored instances"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-entity-details.webp"
       />

    4. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to **Affected**.
       <img
         title="Vulnerability instance details form"
         alt="An image showing the affected form on vulnerability instance details page"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-entity-form.webp"
       />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="bulk-change-status"
    title="Remove ignored status across multiple entities"
  >
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All capabilities > Vulnerability Management** > Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab.

    2. From the settings cog, click the **Ignored** checkbox. This adds an ignore column to your vulnerability table.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities tab with ignored column added"
         alt="An image showing the all entities vulnerabilities tab with an ignore column added"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-bulk-vulnlist.webp"
       />

    3. Select a vulnerability with an **Ignored** count greater than 0.

    4. Update the filter from **Status = Affected** to **Status = Ignored**.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities details"
         alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with the status dropdown open"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-bulk-details.webp"
       />

    5. In the **Area of Impact** section, select the entities you want to mark **Affected**.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities details with instances selected"
         alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with affected instances selected"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-bulk-selection.webp"
       />

    6. Fill out the form to explain the reasoning behind changing this vulnerability to **Affected**.

       <img
         title="Vulnerabilities details with form open"
         alt="An image showing the vulnerability details page with form to change instances to affected"
         src="/images/security_screenshot-affected-bulk-form.webp"
       />
