### Granting access to Security RX

Review the current custom roles created for your organizations. Add 'read' permissions for the 'vulnerabilities' capability to grant access to view Security RX. Standard roles are automatically granted this capability but custom roles need to have 'read' permissions granted.
For more information about custom roles, see [user roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles).

### Removing user access from Security RX

Users with the ability to create/adjust roles within their organization can modify who has access to Security RX feature. You can remove access from Security RX by creating a custom role that does not have 'read' permissions for the 'vulnerabilities' capability. You must then apply this custom role to the users that you wish to restrict.
