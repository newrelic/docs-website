---

Send custom vulnerability or security data to New Relic through our security data API through a simple POST request. Use the API if we don't currently support your security service with an integration or if sending security data through an API fits your custom workflow better.

## Prerequisites

- A New Relic <LicenseKey/> for the account you want to report data to.    


## Send data to New Relic

To send vulnerability or other security data, post a JSON object containing a findings array. Each object in the array describes a detected vulnerability or other security event. 

Here's an example POST request. We'll take a look at individual components in the next section:

```
curl -X POST https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1 \
   -H “Content-Type: application/json” \
   -H “Api-Key: <New Relic License Key>” \
   -d '{"findings": [
     {
       "source": "Security Tool Name",
       "title": "Short description of issue",
       "message": "Long form description of the security issue including remediaton advice",
       "issueType": "Library Vulnerability",
       "issueId": "Well-known vulnerability identifier like CVE, CWE, CIS, etc.",
       "issueVendorId": "Vendor-specific identifier if different from issueId",
       "issueInstanceKey": "unique_path_to_this_instance_of_the_issue",
       "disclosureUrl": "https://url/link/for/more/information",
       "severity": "CRITICAL",
       "remediationExists": true,
       "remediationRecommendation": "upgrade TheComponent to 1.2.3",
       "detectedAt": "1665610506000",
       "entityType": "Host|Service|Repository|...",
       "entityLookupValue": "a.hostname.com",
       "entityGuid": "ABCDEFGH",
       "customFields": {
         "sourceDetailInfo": "DecadeCoffee",
         ...
       }
     },
     ...
   ]}'
```

    <tr>
      <td>
        `issueID`
      </td>
      <td>
        A standard identifier for the detected issue. For example, the CVE or CWE identifier, or the  CIS benchmark rule. If multiple tools detect the same issue, the `issueId` should be the same across all tools.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `severity`
      </td>
      <td>
        The defined community consensus on the severity of the issue or the scanning tool. This should be one of the following:

            An example with `entityLookupValue` would be:

            ```
            "entityType": "AWS",

            `entityLookupValue`
        </td>
        <td>
