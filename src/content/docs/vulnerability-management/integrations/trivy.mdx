title: Trivy security integration 
metaDescription: 'Send your Trivy scan results in SARIF'
---

Send your Trivy scan results into New Relic Vulnerability Management to unify your security findings in one place. This integration utilizes the security data API's ability to process Trivy findings in SARIF.

## Prerequisites

- A New Relic <LicenseKey/> for the account you want to report data to.    


## Send data to New Relic

To ingest your Trivy scan result files in SARIF into New Relic, utilize the security data API with the `X-SCANNER` header set to `Trivy`.

Here's an example curl POST:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1?repository=<https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_USER/MY_TRIVY_REPO>' \
--header 'Api-Key: <NewRelicLicenseKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Scanner: Trivy' \
-d @nameOfSarifFile.json
 ```

 <Callout variant='tip'>
  Replace `<RepositoryUrl>` with your integration repository (optional).
</Callout>

## Confirm scan import activity
The HTTP response from the POST will include a request uuid and information about the request. For example:

```
{
  "success":false,
  "errorMessage":null,
  "uuid":"4740e3c8-dbc4-46e6-a4b2-a7fb6f918d20"
}
```

The request guid is included in all vulnerability events which can be [queried with NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/). These events are written in real time as the import job runs. To view the status and output of an import as it runs, use this NRQL query (replacing `YOUR_REQUEST_ID` with the uuid returned from your HTTP POST):

```
FROM Log SELECT * WHERE source = 'Trivy' AND requestId = 'YOUR_REQUEST_ID'
```
