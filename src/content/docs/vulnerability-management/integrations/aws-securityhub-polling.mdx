You can import AWS Security Hub findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities. The process uses the AWS API to poll for findings from AWS Security reporting services.
After completing these steps, you will see new vulnerabilities detected by AWS Security tools in your New Relic account in real time, and you'll be able to build out analytics dashboards and enable <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> on newly detected issues.
