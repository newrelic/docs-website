title: AWS security hub integration (Polling method)
metaDescription: 'Send your security data from AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and inspector directly to New Relic.'
freshnessValidatedDate: never
---

You can import AWS Security Hub findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities. The process uses the AWS API to poll for findings from AWS Security reporting services.
After completing these steps, you will see new vulnerabilities detected by AWS Security tools in your New Relic account in real time, and you'll be able to build out analytics dashboards and enable <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> on newly detected issues.

## Set up API polling [#set-up-api]

Follow these procedures to set up API polling. Both procedures require you to move between the New Relic UI and your AWS account.

To connect additional <DNT>**API Polling**</DNT> integrations to New Relic:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>. Click on one of the available service tiles. From the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles), click <DNT>**Roles**</DNT> > <DNT>**Create role**</DNT> >  <DNT>**AWS account**</DNT> > <DNT>**Another AWS account**</DNT>. Input the following:

   * For `Account ID`, use `754728514883`
   * Check the `Require external ID` box
   * For `External ID`, enter your New Relic account ID
   * Don't enable the setting to `Require MFA` (multi-factor authentication)
1. Attach the <DNT>**Policy**</DNT>: Search for `ReadOnlyAccess` in the <DNT>**Permissions policies**</DNT> text box, select the checkbox for the policy named `ReadOnlyAccess`, then click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>. Alternatively, you can [create your own managed policy](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor.
1. Enter `NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations` for the <DNT>**Role name**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Create role**</DNT> to select the newly created role from the list. On the <DNT>**Role summary**</DNT> page, select and copy the entire <DNT>**Role ARN**</DNT> (required later in this procedure).
1. Configure a <DNT>**Budgets**</DNT> policy by viewing the <DNT>**Role summary**</DNT> for your new role. Open the <DNT>**Add permissions**</DNT> drop-down and click on <DNT>**Create inline policy**</DNT>. Open the <DNT>**JSON**</DNT> tab and add the following permission statement:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
            "budgets:ViewBudget"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
        ]
    }
    ```
1. Click <DNT>**Review policy**</DNT> to enter a policy name (like `NewRelicBudget`), then select <DNT>**Create policy**</DNT>.
1. Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role that you saved in step 2.
1. Select the AWS services you want to monitor with the infrastructure integrations, then <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

It may take few minutes until new resources are detected and synthesized as entities. See Cloud integrations [system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits) for more information.

If you previously set up an ARN with a restrictive <DNT>**AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess**</DNT> policy, unlink your existing integration and create a new ARN with a broader policy.

Follow the instructions to [connect your Amazon account to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/amazon-aws-ec2-integration-infrastructure#connect) .
Provide the ARN that contains the <DNT>**ReadOnlyAccess**</DNT> policy.

Once you complete your setup, you can see your integrations at <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>.
