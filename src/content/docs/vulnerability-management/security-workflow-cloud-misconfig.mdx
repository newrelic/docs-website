This document covers how to:

* Improve your cloud security posture in real-time
* Reduce context switching with automatic synchronization of AWS Security Hub findings (and other cloud vendors)
* Automate prioritization of security findings across all services, infrastructure, and cloud resources using threat intelligence and observability data
* Assign remediation to security engineers and track progress

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).


## View the misconfiguration status of your cloud environment [#cloud-misconfig]
New Relic Security RX provides a comprehensive view of your cloud security posture, allowing you to identify and remediate misconfigurations in real-time. By integrating with AWS Security Hub and other cloud vendors, you can automatically synchronize findings and reduce context switching. This integration allows you to view and manage security findings from multiple cloud services in one place, streamlining your security operations.

Once vulnerability data starts flowing into New Relic, you can access your data through various scoped views. To view a summary of your entire system, navigate to the [Security RX capability > Security RX - Applications > Overview](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management/apm-summary). This page provides curated dashboards representing the vulnerability of your system and baseline security hygiene.

Dig deeper into the security of your system by auditing the vulnerability of all your entities, libraries, and active vulnerabilities:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="entity"
    title="Manage vulnerabilities for all your entities"
  >
    From the Security RX - Applications summary page, select <DNT>**Entities**</DNT> to review the vulnerability status of all your applications. This view shows all your applications and code repositories, and allows you to prioritize vulnerability remediation based on weighted vulnerabilities scores and severity profiles.

    Clicking into an entity opens up a scoped entity view of Security RX. Learn more about our scoped entity view in our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="library"
    title="Understand the security impact of libraries"
  >
    From the Security RX - Applications summary page, select <DNT>**Libraries**</DNT> to review the security impact of all libraries in your system. This view shows all the libraries used by your services and their security impact through vulnerability counts and severity.

    Upon clicking a library, it provides you with a list of all library versions currently in use as well as a tab which displays all the vulnerabilities detected due to the library.

    Upon clicking a library version, it provides you with a list of affected entities and vulnerabilities detected due to this library version.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="vuln"
    title="Manage specific vulnerabilities"
  >
    From the <DNT>**Security RX - Applications overview**</DNT> page, select <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT> to review all the vulnerabilities in your software system. This view shows every vulnerability, priority rank, reason for prioritizing it, number of entities affected, detected by and much more.

    This view is especially useful when responding to a specific vulnerability. Instead of reviewing each service to see if it's impacted, this view condenses info based on vulnerability instead of entity or library.

    Find the vulnerability you need to remediate, click it, review its direct impact of services, and take the recommended remediation steps.
