As a member of a DevSecOps, platform, or security team, you need comprehensive visibility into your organization's cloud security posture and the ability to coordinate remediation efforts across multiple teams and accounts. Security RX Cloud provides the centralized view and collaboration tools you need to manage cloud security at scale.

This document covers how to:

* Gain organization-wide visibility into cloud security posture
* Understand and communicate security risk across stakeholders
* Coordinate remediation efforts with development and operations teams
* Track progress on security improvements over time
* Reduce context switching with automatic synchronization of AWS Security Hub findings

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as an engineer](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-workflow-misconfig).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* [Security RX Cloud integration set up](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-misconfig-setup) across all monitored AWS accounts
* AWS Security Hub enabled in your organization's AWS accounts
* Appropriate permissions to view security data across accounts and regions
* Team access configured for Security RX in New Relic

<Callout variant="tip">
  For organization-wide visibility, ensure Security RX Cloud is configured for all AWS accounts in your organization. See our [setup guide](/docs/vulnerability-management/cloud-misconfig-setup) for multi-account configuration.
</Callout>


## Assess organization-wide cloud security posture [#assess-posture]

Security RX Cloud provides comprehensive visibility into your organization's cloud security posture, allowing you to identify trends, prioritize remediation efforts, and communicate risk to stakeholders.

### Problems this approach solves

* **Fragmented security visibility**: No single view of security posture across multiple AWS accounts and regions
* **Stakeholder communication**: Difficulty explaining security risk and progress to executives and business teams
* **Resource allocation**: Uncertainty about where to focus security team efforts for maximum impact
* **Compliance reporting**: Manual effort required to generate security posture reports

### Access the organization overview

Navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Security RX > Cloud**</DNT> to access your comprehensive cloud security dashboard.

### Key metrics for security leaders

The cloud overview provides executive-level insights including:

* **Total misconfiguration count**: Overall volume and trends over time
* **Risk distribution**: Breakdown of critical, high, medium, and low-risk findings
* **Account-level analysis**: Which AWS accounts pose the highest risk
* **Regional distribution**: Geographic concentration of security issues
* **Resource type analysis**: Which AWS services require the most attention
* **Compliance posture**: Standards-based findings vs. active threat indicators

### Trending and historical analysis

Use the time-based controls to understand:

* **Security posture trajectory**: Whether your organization is improving or degrading over time
* **Remediation velocity**: How quickly teams are addressing security findings
* **New vs. resolved findings**: Balance between new discoveries and remediation efforts
* **Seasonal patterns**: Whether certain times correlate with more security issues

## Coordinate remediation efforts across teams [#coordinate-remediation]

Security teams need to coordinate remediation efforts across multiple development and operations teams while tracking progress and ensuring accountability.

### Problems this workflow solves

* **Remediation assignment**: Difficulty assigning security findings to the right teams and individuals
* **Progress tracking**: No visibility into whether assigned remediation work is being completed
* **Team collaboration**: Challenges coordinating between security, development, and operations teams
* **Escalation management**: Unclear processes for handling overdue or critical security findings

### Team-based remediation management

    title="Assign remediation by entity ownership"
  >
    Use Security RX Cloud's entity-based approach to assign remediation work:

    * **Entity ownership mapping**: Associate cloud resources with responsible teams through tagging and metadata
    * **Bulk assignment**: Assign multiple related misconfigurations to teams based on resource ownership
    * **Workflow integration**: Connect assignments to your existing ticketing and project management systems
    * **Notification automation**: Set up alerts when new critical findings are assigned to teams

    Navigate to the **Resources** view to see all cloud resources organized by ownership and security posture.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="progress-tracking"
    title="Track remediation progress and velocity"
  >
    Monitor organization-wide remediation efforts through comprehensive tracking:

    * **Team dashboards**: See which teams have outstanding security work and their remediation velocity
    * **SLA monitoring**: Track whether teams are meeting security remediation service level agreements
    * **Escalation triggers**: Automatically escalate overdue critical findings to management
    * **Progress reporting**: Generate reports showing security improvement trends across teams

    Use filtering to view progress by team, severity, or finding type for focused management.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="collaboration-workflows"
    title="Enable security-development collaboration"
  >
    Facilitate collaboration between security and development teams:

    * **Shared context**: Provide teams with the same view of security findings and their business impact
    * **Remediation guidance**: Share Security RX Cloud's detailed remediation instructions with development teams
    * **Verification collaboration**: Work with teams to verify that fixes are properly implemented
    * **Knowledge sharing**: Use remediation patterns to educate teams on secure configuration practices

    The individual finding detail pages provide all the context teams need to understand and fix security issues.

## Advanced security team workflows [#advanced-workflows]

### Risk-based prioritization for security leaders

Security teams need to make strategic decisions about resource allocation and risk acceptance:

* **Risk scoring validation**: Review and adjust Security RX Cloud's intelligent risk scoring based on organizational context
* **Compliance mapping**: Understand which findings relate to specific compliance frameworks (SOC 2, PCI DSS, etc.)
* **Business impact assessment**: Correlate security findings with business-critical applications and data
* **Risk acceptance documentation**: Track decisions about accepted risks and their justifications

### Metrics and KPIs for security programs

Use Security RX Cloud data to measure and improve your security program:

* **Mean time to remediation (MTTR)**: Track how quickly your organization addresses security findings
* **Security debt**: Monitor the accumulation of unaddressed security findings over time
* **Team performance**: Compare remediation velocity across different teams and applications
* **Trend analysis**: Identify whether your security posture is improving over time

### Integration with security tools and processes

* **SIEM integration**: Export security findings to your Security Information and Event Management system
* **Ticketing integration**: Automatically create tickets in Jira, ServiceNow, or other systems
* **Compliance reporting**: Generate reports for auditors and compliance teams
* **Executive dashboards**: Create executive-level views of security posture and progress
