Security RX Cloud provides comprehensive, AI-generated remediation playbooks that guide you through fixing cloud misconfigurations using your preferred workflow. Instead of researching fixes across multiple sources, you get step-by-step instructions tailored to your tools and processes.

## Problems remediation playbooks solve

Traditional cloud security tools often leave you with incomplete information when it comes to actually fixing issues:

* **Research overhead**: Time wasted looking up how to fix security misconfigurations across AWS documentation and security guides
* **Context switching**: Having to leave your security dashboard to research and implement fixes
* **Workflow mismatch**: Remediation guidance that doesn't match your team's preferred tools and processes
* **Verification uncertainty**: Not knowing how to confirm that a fix was properly implemented
* **Incomplete fixes**: Partial solutions that don't address the root cause of security issues

## How Security RX Cloud remediation works

Security RX Cloud's remediation system provides complete, AI-generated playbooks that include:

### Multiple workflow options
Every misconfiguration includes remediation instructions for different workflows, so you can choose the approach that fits your team's processes.

### Production-ready code
All code snippets are production-ready and follow security best practices, reducing the risk of introducing new issues while fixing existing ones.

### Verification steps
Each remediation playbook includes steps to verify that the fix was properly implemented and the security issue is resolved.

## Remediation workflow options [#workflow-options]

Security RX Cloud provides remediation instructions for four different workflows, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your team's processes and tools.

### Console-based remediation [#console-remediation]

**Best for**: Quick fixes, one-off remediation, teams preferring graphical interfaces

The Console workflow provides step-by-step, numbered instructions for fixing misconfigurations using the AWS Management Console.

**What you get**:
* **Sequential steps**: Clear, numbered instructions that walk you through each click and selection
* **Visual guidance**: Screenshots and descriptions of what you'll see in the AWS console
* **Error handling**: Common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them
* **Verification steps**: How to confirm the fix was applied correctly

**Example use cases**:
* Emergency fixes that need immediate implementation
* One-time configuration changes
* Teams new to infrastructure automation
* Development and testing environments

### CLI-based remediation [#cli-remediation]

**Best for**: Automation scripts, command-line-first teams, batch operations

The CLI workflow provides exact, copy-pasteable AWS CLI commands with detailed explanations.

**What you get**:
* **Copy-pasteable commands**: Ready-to-run AWS CLI commands with all necessary parameters
* **Command explanations**: Clear descriptions of what each command does and why it's necessary
* **Parameter details**: Explanation of command parameters and how to customize them for your environment
* **Error handling**: Common CLI errors and how to troubleshoot them

**Example use cases**:
* Scripted remediation across multiple resources
* Integration with existing automation tools
* Bulk fixes across multiple AWS accounts
* Teams comfortable with command-line interfaces

### CloudFormation remediation [#cloudformation-remediation]

**Best for**: Infrastructure as Code workflows, preventing configuration drift, production environments

The CloudFormation workflow provides production-ready Infrastructure as Code templates that fix misconfigurations at the source.

**What you get**:
* **Complete templates**: Ready-to-deploy CloudFormation templates with proper resource definitions
* **Parameter configuration**: Customizable parameters for different environments and use cases
* **Resource relationships**: Proper dependencies and references between related resources
* **Best practices**: Templates follow AWS CloudFormation best practices and security guidelines

**Example use cases**:
* Production environment fixes that need to be permanent
* Preventing configuration drift by codifying correct configurations
* Teams using Infrastructure as Code for deployment and management
* Fixes that need to be replicated across multiple environments

### Terraform remediation [#terraform-remediation]

**Best for**: Terraform-based infrastructure management, multi-cloud environments, DevOps workflows

The Terraform workflow provides Terraform code snippets that integrate with your existing Terraform configurations.

**What you get**:
* **Terraform resources**: Properly configured Terraform resource blocks with correct arguments
* **Variable usage**: Examples of how to parameterize configurations for different environments
* **Provider requirements**: Necessary provider configurations and version constraints
* **State management**: Guidance on importing existing resources if needed

**Example use cases**:
* Teams already using Terraform for infrastructure management
* Multi-cloud environments where Terraform provides consistency
* DevOps workflows that require infrastructure changes to go through version control
* Organizations with Terraform-based CI/CD pipelines

## Remediation process workflow [#remediation-process]

### 1. Access misconfiguration details

Navigate to the specific misconfiguration you want to remediate:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Security RX > Cloud**</DNT>
2. Select **Misconfigurations** to view the detailed list
3. Click on the specific misconfiguration you want to fix

### 2. Understand the issue

Before implementing fixes, review the misconfiguration details:

* **Risk assessment**: Why this misconfiguration matters and its potential impact
* **Affected resources**: Complete list of resources with this security finding
* **Business context**: How this issue relates to your applications and data
* **Compliance implications**: Whether this finding affects regulatory compliance

### 3. Choose your remediation workflow

Select the remediation tab that matches your preferred workflow:

* **Console**: For immediate, interactive fixes
* **CLI**: For command-line-based remediation
* **CloudFormation**: For Infrastructure as Code fixes
* **Terraform**: For Terraform-managed infrastructure

### 4. Implement the fix

Follow the step-by-step instructions provided for your chosen workflow:

* **Copy the provided code**: All code snippets are ready to use
* **Customize parameters**: Adjust any parameters for your specific environment
* **Execute the fix**: Implement the remediation following the provided steps
* **Handle errors**: Use the troubleshooting guidance if you encounter issues

### 5. Verify the fix

Every remediation playbook includes verification steps:

* **Confirmation commands**: CLI commands or console checks to verify the fix
* **Expected results**: What you should see if the fix was implemented correctly
* **Troubleshooting**: What to do if verification fails
* **Monitoring**: How to ensure the fix remains in place over time

## Advanced remediation scenarios [#advanced-scenarios]

### Bulk remediation across resources

When the same misconfiguration affects multiple resources:

* **CLI approach**: Use AWS CLI with loops or scripts to apply fixes across multiple resources
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Update your templates to fix the issue across all affected resources
* **Automation integration**: Integrate remediation commands into your existing automation tools

### Multi-account remediation

For organizations with multiple AWS accounts:

* **Cross-account roles**: Use the provided CLI commands with cross-account role assumptions
* **Account-specific parameters**: Customize the remediation for each account's specific configuration
* **Centralized deployment**: Use AWS Organizations or other centralized deployment tools

### Environment-specific considerations

Different environments may require different approaches:

* **Production**: Prefer Infrastructure as Code approaches to ensure changes are tracked and reversible
* **Development**: Console or CLI approaches may be faster for non-critical environments
* **Testing**: Use remediation as an opportunity to test fixes before applying to production

## Best practices for remediation [#best-practices]

### Security considerations

* **Test fixes first**: Apply fixes to development or testing environments before production
* **Backup configurations**: Take snapshots or backups before making changes
* **Understand impact**: Review how fixes might affect application functionality
* **Monitor after changes**: Watch for any unexpected behavior after implementing fixes

### Process integration

* **Change management**: Include security remediation in your change management processes
* **Documentation**: Document what was fixed and why for future reference
* **Team communication**: Notify relevant teams about security fixes that might affect their services
* **Continuous improvement**: Use remediation patterns to improve your security practices

### Automation opportunities

* **Script common fixes**: Automate frequently needed remediation tasks
* **CI/CD integration**: Include security fixes in your deployment pipelines
* **Monitoring automation**: Set up alerts to detect when misconfigurations reoccur
* **Policy as code**: Implement preventive controls to avoid future misconfigurations

## Troubleshooting remediation issues [#troubleshooting]

### Common remediation challenges

* **Permission errors**: Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions for the remediation actions
* **Resource dependencies**: Some fixes may require changes to related resources
* **Timing issues**: Some changes may take time to propagate across AWS services
* **Validation failures**: Resources may not immediately show as fixed due to polling delays

### Getting help
