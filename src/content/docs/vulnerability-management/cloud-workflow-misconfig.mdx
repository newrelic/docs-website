This document covers how to:

* Improve your cloud security posture in real-time 
* Reduce context switching with automatic synchronization of AWS Security Hub findings (and other cloud vendors)
* Automate prioritization of security findings across all services, infrastructure, and cloud resources using threat intelligence and observability data

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow-cloud-misconfig).

## Manage misconfigurations in your cloud environment [#cloud-misconfig]
New Relic Security RX provides a comprehensive view of your cloud security posture, allowing you to identify and remediate misconfigurations in real-time. By integrating with AWS Security Hub and other cloud vendors, you can automatically synchronize findings and reduce context switching.
This integration allows you to view and manage security findings from multiple cloud services in one place, streamlining your security operations.
To get started, navigate to the Security RX capability in New Relic and select the **Cloud** tab. Here, you can view a summary of your cloud security posture, including misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security findings.

To monitor the health of specific applications or services, use our entity scoped view by navigating to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an entity) > Security RX > Overview**</DNT>. For a larger scope, refer to [managing vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow).

The **Cloud** tab provides a comprehensive view of your cloud security posture, including:
* New misconfigurations
* Top critical regions
* Top resource types
* Top risks
* Top risks by account
* Top critical virtual private cloud (VPC) 


## Triage, prioritize, and remediate misconfigurations [#prioritize]

To triage, prioritize, and remediate misconfigurations, navigate to the **Vulnerabilities** tab in the Security RX capability. Here, you can view all open vulnerabilities and filter them by attributes such as priority, severity, number of affected entities, impacted entity type, and source. Clicking on a specific vulnerability provides detailed information about its severity, sources, vulnerability status change logs, and much more.

To view all vulnerabilities of your service or application, in the left navigation pane, under **Security RX** section, select <DNT>**Security RX - cloud**</DNT>.
