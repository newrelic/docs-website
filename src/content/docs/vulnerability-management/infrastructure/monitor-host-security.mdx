<Callout variant="preview" title="Preview Feature">
Security RX for Infrastructure is currently in preview. We're actively improving this feature and would love your feedback.

This feature is provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy) and [service specific terms](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/service-specific).
</Callout>

This document covers how to:

* Identify the vulnerabilities with the highest risk in your infrastructure
* Understand vulnerability risk for specific hosts
* Surface tasks from your security team in your daily workflow so it's easy to deliver more secure infrastructure

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities across all infrastructure](/docs/vulnerability-management/infrastructure/manage-infrastructure-vulnerabilities).

## Maintain the vulnerability health of your infrastructure

Once vulnerability data starts flowing into New Relic, you can access your data through various scoped views.

To monitor the health of specific hosts, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > (select an entity) > Security > Summary**</DNT> and use the **entity scoped** view. For a larger scope, refer to our document on [managing vulnerabilities organization-wide](/docs/vulnerability-management/infrastructure/manage-infrastructure-vulnerabilities).

  </DNT>

The **Security summary** page for an entity gives you a high-level overview of the security of your application or service. Curated dashboards provide you an overall view of the security of your application or service, including:

* Total vulnerabilities
* Package vulnerabilities
* Misconfigurations
* Vulnerability exposure window
* Top five vulnerabilities in accordance with the priority rankings
* Vulnerability breakdown by type
* Package severity breakdown
* Top package upgrades 

To monitor the health of your infrastructure, use the entity scoped view by navigating to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > (select an entity) > Security> Summary**</DNT>. For a larger scope, see our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow).



## Triage, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities [#prioritize]

To view all vulnerabilities open for your infrastructure,  in the left navigation pane, under **Security** section,  select the <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT>.:

This page shows you all open vulnerabilities and allows you to filter them by attributes such as severity and source. Clicking on a specific vulnerability provides detailed information about its severity, sources, vulnerability status change logs, and many more.
