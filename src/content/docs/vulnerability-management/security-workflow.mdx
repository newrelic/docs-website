This document covers how to: 
    - Calculate the vulnerability surface area of our software systems
    - Understand how runtime architecture of each application affects business risk, vulnerability and severity
    - Assign security tasks to individual developers

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).

## Prerequisites

Vulnerability data sent through [one of our integrations](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/overview).

## View the vulnerability surface area of your systems

Once vulnerability data starts flowing into New Relic, you can access your data through various scoped views. To view a summary of your entire system navigate to the [Vulnerability Management summary page](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management). This page provides curated dashboards representing the vulnerability of your system and baseline security hygiene. 

Dig deeper into the security of your system by auditing the vulnerability of all your entities, libraries, and active vulnerabilities:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="entity"
    title="Manage vulnerabilities for all your entities"
  >

<img
  title="Vulnerability Management overview"
  alt="An image showing the entity Vulnerability Management table page."
  src={vmEntitySec}
/>

From the Vulnerability Management summary page select **Entities** to review the vulnerability status of all your entities. This view shows all your entities and allows you to scan and prioratize vulnerability remediation based on weighted vulnerabilities scores and severity profiles.

Clicking into an entity opens up a scoped entity view of Vulnerability Management. Learn more about our scoped entity view in our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="library"
    title="Understand the security impact of libraries"
  >

<img
  title="Vulnerability library overview"
  alt="Understand the security impact of libraries"
  src={vmLibraries}
/>

From the Vulnerability Management summary page select **Libraries** to review the security impact of all libraries in your system. This view shows all the libraries used by your services and their security impact through vulnerability counts and severity. 

<img
  title="Vulnerability library details"
  alt="Understand library details"
  src={vmLibDetails}
/>

Clicking into a specific library provides a detailed view of that library including the number of services using the library, the number of services impacted by  CVEs, and details about specific CVEs.
  </Collapser>

<Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="vuln"
    title="Manage, assign, and respond to specific vulnerabilities"
  >

<img
  title="Vulnerability overview"
  alt="An image showing the Vulnerability Management table page."
  src={vmVulnTab}
/>

From the Vulnerability Management **Summary** page select **Vulnerabilities** to review all the vulnerabilities in your software system. This view shows every vulnerability, their source, number of impacted entities, and when they were first and last seen. 

This view is especially useful when responding to a specific vulnerability found in specific versions of libraries. Instead of reviewing each service to see if it is impacted, this view condenses info based on vulnerability instead of entity or library. Simply find the vulnerability you need to remediate, click into it, and review its direct impact of services and take the recommended remediation steps.

<img
  title="Vulnerability assignment"
  alt="An image showing the vulnerability assignment workflow."

Once you've identified the entities impacted by a specific vulnerability, you can assign the remediation of that vulnerability in a specific entity to a user. This helps organize large scale remediation between multiple teams and ownership structures.
