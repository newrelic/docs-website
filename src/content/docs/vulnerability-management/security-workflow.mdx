This document covers how to:

* Calculate the vulnerability surface area of our software systems
* Understand how runtime architecture of each application affects business risk, vulnerability and severity

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

Vulnerability data sent through [one of our integrations](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/overview).

## View the vulnerability surface area of your systems [#vulnerability-area]

Once vulnerability data starts flowing into New Relic, you can access your data through various scoped views. To view a summary of your entire system, navigate to the [Vulnerability Management summary page](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management). This page provides curated dashboards representing the vulnerability of your system and baseline security hygiene.

Dig deeper into the security of your system by auditing the vulnerability of all your entities, libraries, and active vulnerabilities:

    id="entity"
    title="Manage vulnerabilities for all your entities"
  >
    From the Vulnerability Management summary page, select <DNT>**Entities**</DNT> to review the vulnerability status of all your entities. This view shows all your entities and allows you to scan and prioratize vulnerability remediation based on weighted vulnerabilities scores and severity profiles.

    Clicking into an entity opens up a scoped entity view of Vulnerability Management. Learn more about our scoped entity view in our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow).

    From the Vulnerability Management summary page, select <DNT>**Libraries**</DNT> to review the security impact of all libraries in your system. This view shows all the libraries used by your services and their security impact through vulnerability counts and severity.

    Upon clicking a library, it provides you with list of all library versions currently in use as well as a tab which displays all the vulnerabilties detected due to the library.

    Upon clicking a library version, it provides you with list of affected entities and vulnerabilties detected due to this library version.

    From the <DNT>**Vulnerability Management Summary**</DNT> page, select <DNT>**Vulnerabilities**</DNT> to review all the vulnerabilities in your software system. This view shows every vulnerability, priority rank, reason for prioritizing it, number of entities affected, detected by and much more.

    This view is especially useful when responding to a specific vulnerability found in specific versions of libraries. Instead of reviewing each service to see if it's impacted, this view condenses info based on vulnerability instead of entity or library.

    Find the vulnerability you need to solve, click it, review its direct impact of services, and take the recommended remediation steps.
