Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.
With New Relic Security Remediation Explorer (Security RX), your team’s engineers from DevOps, SREs, Infosec, and other teams can work together, share security information, identify vulnerabilities, and address risks at every stage of SDLC.
Security thus becomes a team sport and not the job of only one team.

With New Relic security RX, you get:

* Birds-eye view of overall vulnerabilities - including the ones that are detected by New Relic platform and our integration partners such as FOSSA, AWS Security hub, Trivy, Snyk, Dependabot, and others.
* Run time visibility of vulnerabilities that your applications or infrastructure may experience (helping you validate if a security patch has been deployed successfully!)
* Prioritisation feature helps you assess and address the vulnerabilities that are urgent or matter the most.
* Triaging and remediation support.

Thus, you can overcome security blindspots across your entire software application and its associated infrastructure without reducing your team’s efficiency and without getting overwhelmed by the thousands and thousands of vulnerabilities that your teams may encounter.

As a developer, you want to:

        * Maintain a healthy application
        * Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities in my software portfolio
        * Understand the severity of vulnerabilities
        * Surface "security" tasks from my security team in my daily workflow so it's easy to deliver more secure software with less toil

To dive deeper into these use cases, see [Manage vulnerabilities as a developer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow/).

As a member of a security team, you want to:

        * Calculate the vulnerability surface area of my software systems
        * Understand how runtime architecture of each application affects business risk, vulnerability, and severity
