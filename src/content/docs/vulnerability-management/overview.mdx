Overcome security blindspots with the New Relic vulnerability management capability. Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.

New Relic vulnerability management provides a birds eye view of all your software’s vulnerabilities so you can:
- Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities
- Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software 
- Triage and assign vulnerabilities to users with explicit remediation steps provided

[Activate your free trial](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management) to get started today.



## Requirements 

- Vulnerability management is available to full platform users on a pro or enterprise account. 
- Vulnerability management isn't currently available to EU region customers, HIPPA-enabled accounts, or FedRamp-enabled accounts. 

## Insight for developers, security teams, and architects

The New Relic platform provides a single source of truth about the security of your dependencies through integrating vulnerability data from services instrumented with our agents or third party tools.
