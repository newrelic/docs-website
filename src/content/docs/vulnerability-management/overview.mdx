Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t provide the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce efficiently. With New Relic Security Remediation Explorer (Security RX), engineers from DevSecOps, SREs, and InfoSec teams can collaborate faster, identifying, triaging, and remediating vulnerabilities across your estate.

With Security RX, you get:

* A birds-eye view of all vulnerabilities, including the ones that are detected by the New Relic platform and our integration partners such as [FOSSA](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/fossa/), [AWS Security Hub](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/aws/), [Trivy](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/trivy), [Snyk](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/snyk/), [Dependabot](/install/vm/), and more.

* Continuous run-time visibility of vulnerabilities in your applications and infrastructure 

* Near real-time deployment validation of security patches 



With Security RX, overcome security blindspots across your entire stack from application to infrastructure  without sacrificing velocity. Spend less time triaging false positives and low value findings, so your team can fix less and deliver more.

As an engineer, you want to:

        * Maintain a healthy application
        * Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities in your software portfolio
        * Understand the risk each vulnerability poses
        * Surface "security" tasks from the security team in your daily workflow so it's easy to deliver more secure software with less toil

To dive deeper into these use cases, see [Manage vulnerabilities as an engineer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow/).

As a member of a security team, you want to:

        * Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software systems
        * Understand how runtime architecture of each application affects business risk, vulnerability, and severity

To dive deeper into these use cases, see [Manage vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow).
