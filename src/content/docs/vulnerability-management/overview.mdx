Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t provide the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce efficiently. With New Relic Security Remediation Explorer (Security RX), your team’s engineers from DevSecOps, SREs, and Infosecteams can collaborate faster , identifying, triaging, and remediating vulnerabilities across your estate.
