Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t provide the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce efficiently. With New Relic Security Remediation Explorer (Security RX), engineers from DevSecOps, SREs, and InfoSec teams can collaborate faster, identifying, triaging, and remediating vulnerabilities across your estate.

With Security RX, you get:

* A birds-eye view of all vulnerabilities, including the ones that are detected by the New Relic platform and our integration partners such as [FOSSA](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/fossa/), [AWS Security Hub](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/aws/), [Trivy](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/trivy), [Snyk](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/snyk/), [Dependabot](/install/vm/), and more.

* Continuous run-time visibility of vulnerabilities in your applications, infrastructure, and cloud environments

* Near real-time deployment validation of security patches 



With Security RX, overcome security blindspots across your entire stack from application to infrastructure  without sacrificing velocity. Spend less time triaging false positives and low value findings, so your team can fix less and deliver more.

[Visit one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management) to get started today.

## Query your security data

Security RX stores vulnerability and cloud misconfiguration data as `SECURITY_FINDING` entities in NRDB, which you can query using NRQL to create custom dashboards, set up alerts, and analyze your security posture. For comprehensive NRQL query examples, see [Security data NRQL query examples](/docs/nrql/nrql-examples/security-nrql-query-examples).

As an engineer, you want to:

        * Maintain a healthy application
        * Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities in your software portfolio
        * Understand the risk each vulnerability poses
        * Surface "security" tasks from the security team in your daily workflow so it's easy to deliver more secure software with less toil

To dive deeper into these use cases, see [Manage vulnerabilities as an engineer](/docs/vulnerability-management/dev-workflow/).

As a member of a security team, you want to:

        * Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software systems
        * Understand how runtime architecture of each application affects business risk, vulnerability, and severity

Certainly! Here's a more concise version of the pricing section for Security RX capability:

## Security RX pricing


Security RX uses three meters for pricing based on monitored entities:

* **APM services**
* **Infrastructure hosts**
* **Cloud resources**

**Pricing and packaging**

* **Advanced compute:** Billed via a CCU meter based on entity count.
* **Minimum commitment:** 1-month minimum for active monitoring.


New Relic Security RX provides automated, continuous vulnerability monitoring for APM and infrastructure instances, correlating security findings across third-party tools to cloud resources. Monthly costs depend on workloads monitored:

* **Application Vulnerability Monitoring:** Evaluates APM Services for software vulnerabilities, correlating and enriching findings. Costs are based on the number of services assessed monthly, prorated for intermittent applications.

* **Infrastructure Vulnerability Monitoring:** Evaluates infrastructure instances for vulnerabilities, correlating and enriching findings. Costs are based on the number of hosts assessed monthly, prorated for intermittent hosts.

* **Cloud Security Assessments:** Correlates and enriches findings for cloud resources. Costs are based on the number of resources assessed monthly, prorated for intermittent resources.

Security RX requires a minimum 30-day activation but can be disabled afterward. Monitoring is billed monthly based on hours monitored.
