</Callout>

Overcome security blindspots with New Relic’s vulnerability management capability. Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.

The New Relic platform provides a birds eye view of all your software’s vulnerabilities so you can:
- Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities
- Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software 
- Triage and assign vulnerabilities to users with explicit remediation steps provided
