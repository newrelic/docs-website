Overcome security blindspots with the New Relic Vulnerability Management capability. Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t give security teams or individual developers the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce.

Vulnerability Management provides a birds-eye view of all your software's vulnerabilities so you can:
- Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities
- Calculate the vulnerability surface area of your software 
- Triage and assign vulnerabilities to users with explicit remediation steps provided

## Monitor your vulnerabilities now

To get started:

1. Create a New Relic account to [start monitoring and remediating your vulnerabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management). 
2. Start [sending vulnerability data from our APM agents or third-party assessment tools](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/intro) or one of our agents.

## Requirements 

- Vulnerability Management is available to full platform users.
- Vulnerability Management isn't available to HIPAA-enabled accounts or FedRamp-enabled accounts.

To report vulnerability data using an APM agent, [ensure it supports vulnerability reporting](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/intro/#apm-agents).

See our [pricing docs](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions/#list-price) for more information on Vulnerability Management pricing.
