Vulnerability management is a continuous process of identifying, analyzing, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities across various entities in applications, endpoints, workloads, and systems.

New Relic Vulnerability Management helps you to find vulnerabilities in both application software and cloud/infrastructure levels. Modern software is composed of thousands of components, and legacy security offerings don’t provide security teams or individual developers with the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities these components introduce. With New Relic, development and security teams gain the necessary insight to monitor and remediate vulnerabilities introduced by software or infrastructure components.

New Relic Vulnerability Management provides a bird's-eye view of all your software and infrastructure vulnerabilities, so you can:

* **Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities:** Quickly pinpoint the vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.
* **Calculate the vulnerability surface area:** Understand the extent of vulnerabilities within your software.
* **Triage, prioritize, and remediate:** Follow provided steps to effectively manage and resolve vulnerabilities.
* **Custom alerts and roles:** Build custom alerts, create custom roles for dashboard views, suppress, and automatically notify VM data.
* **Wide list of exploitable vulnerabilities:** Choose from a reliable and extensive list of known vulnerabilities.
* **Security data API:** Send custom vulnerability or security data to the New Relic platform through the security data API if your security service is not already supported.

## Requirements

* Vulnerability Management is available to full platform users.
* Vulnerability Management requires 'read' permissions for the ['vulnerabilities' capability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#security)

To report vulnerability data using an APM agent, [ensure it supports vulnerability reporting](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/intro/#apm-agents).

See our [pricing docs](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions/#list-price) for more information on Vulnerability Management pricing.

## Monitor your vulnerabilities now

To get started:

1. Create a New Relic account to [start monitoring and remediating your vulnerabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/vulnerability-management).
2. Start [sending vulnerability data from our APM agents or third-party assessment tools](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/intro) or one of our agents.
