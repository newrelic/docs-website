A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. 

Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or send an email to [docs@newrelic.com](mailto:docs@newrelic.com). 
  
  If you're a New Relic employee, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel.
</Callout>

Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image:

* Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance.
* Include a caption with helpful context for the image.
* For screenshot captions, include the path in bold.
* For video captions, include the approximate running time.

## Add an image [#add]

Our docs site images are stored in the `images` directory. They're organized by navigation section name.

For example, the images for the Build an App Guide are located in the build-an-app directory.

## Embed an image [#embed]

You can use Markdown to embed an image:

`![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE "Image title text")`

## Update an image [#update]

To update an image, find its location, and then upload a new image to GitHub with the same filename.

## Write image captions [#labeling]

Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example:

![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png "NR1-dashboards-image.png")

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see [Guidelines for explaining images.](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images#identify-images)

## Add an inline image [#inline-images]

If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this:

```
From the Overview page, select your app's gear <img src="/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/icon-settings.png" alt="icon-settings.png" class="as-char" title="icon-settings.png" /> icon.
```

If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word "icon" in the text. For example, "select your app's gear ![icon-settings.png](./images/icon-settings.png "icon-settings.png") icon."

You can use HTML for any image you want to work with manually.

## Add a fixed width, block level image [#fixed-width-img]

Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes.

Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image.

Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image:

```
<div style="width: 100%; max-width: Npx;">
	   <img alt="ALT TEXT" height="X" src="IMG_URL" title="FILENAME" width="N">
	</div>
	
	<div class="dnd-legend-wrapper" style="width: 100%; max-width: Npx;">
	   <div class="meta"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div>
	</div>
```

## Add Font Awesome 4.7 icons [#icons]

You can also add icons from the [Font Awesome 4.7 library](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/). When using an icon in text, always describe it first. When you embed the icon, follow it with the word "icon" in the text. For example, "select the delete icon."

The code for that phrase is:

```
delete <i class="fa fa-trash-o"><span>fa-trash-o</span></i> icon
```

Replace `fa-trash-o` with the [icon identifier](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) for the icon you're using. Make sure you include the icon identifier inside `<span>` tags. Don't make icons bold.

You can also color Font Awesome icons to more closely match the New Relic user interface. For example, the trash can icon in New Relic Insights is blue: "select the delete icon."

To set the color of an icon, use the HTML `style="color:#HEXCOLOR"` declaration:

```
delete <i class="fa fa-trash-o" style="color:#8FAADA"><span>fa-trash-o</span></i> icon
```
