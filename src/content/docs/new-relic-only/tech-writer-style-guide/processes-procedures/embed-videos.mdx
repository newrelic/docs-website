Embed videos as an additional aid for readers when appropriate; for example, tips for installing or using the New Relic user interface, webinars about more complex features, etc.

* New Relic University has its own site: [learn.newrelic.com](https://learn.newrelic.com/).
* Marketing also stores a library of videos at [newrelic.com/resources/videos](https://newrelic.com/resources/videos) and [newrelic.com/resources/webinars](https://newrelic.com/resources/webinars).

Videos are hosted externally and are embedded in the Docs site's page in an inline frame that links to the external source. Official New Relic videos are hosted on [Wistia](//wistia.com). Although Drupal supports embedding from multiple sources, [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com) are the only other video platforms currently enabled.

## Example [#videos]

There are two methods used to embed: a short code method (recommended) and the legacy method. A custom PHP script handles both methods and generates the required markup and scripts to embed the video.

Here is an example of an embedded video:

\[\[wistia|jceickfqyj|optional description]]

Here is an example of the short code you can use to embed a video:

```
[[wistia |video_id|optional_caption]]
```

Here is an example of the longer code to embed a YouTube video in an iframe:

```
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/video_id" width="560"&gt;</iframe>
```

Include the running time in the caption so users know if they have time to watch it now or later. For an example, see the [Node.js installation documentation](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent#video).

## Procedure

To add an embedded video to a document:

1. Copy the [short code example](#example) and paste it into your document.
2. Replace the video_id with your video's ID (located in the parent &lt;div> ID of an existing video or in the Wistia UI).
3. Verify the running time, and add a caption by inserting the optional_caption in the short code.
4. For NRU videos, add the following at the end of the caption:

   ```
   View more videos and tutorials at learn.newrelic.com.
   ```
5. Always test the embedded video before publishing the doc.
