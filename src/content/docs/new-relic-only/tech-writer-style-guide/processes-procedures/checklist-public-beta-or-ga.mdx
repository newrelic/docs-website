This is a checklist of things to do when you move a hidden beta docs project to public beta or GA. Depending on the project, individual items may or may not be applicable.

## Taxonomy

Tasks may include:

1. Set up [taxonomy](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/drupal-taxonomy/primary-navigation-taxonomy-management#nav-structure) for new category.
2. Set up [footer block](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/page-components/manage-content-footers) for new taxonomy.
3. Add release notes sub-cat for release notes taxonomy. Create [release notes](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/create-release-notes) template and share with product team to write.
4. [Set up RSS](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/working-rss-feeds) for release notes. Make a [dummy doc](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/menu-management/add-or-edit-dummy-doc-links-menus) to point to the release notes taxonomy.

## Individual docs [#individual]

Tasks may include:

1. Verify all doc Jiras in your Epic are finished.
2. Remove or update watermark in each doc.
3. Remove `in-page-toc` **Contents** section from each doc.
4. Remove text below `more_help` **For more help** for each doc.
5. Remove `metaRobot` flags from each doc.
6. Make sure each doc has a good `metaDescription`.
7. Click each doc's `Generate automatic alias` checkbox when you publish it.

## Publication

Tasks may include:

1. Make sure all hidden docs have been published.
2. Make sure any other related docs that were saved as `Hold for Release` have been published.
3. Spot-check the order of docs in their published taxonomy to make sure they do not all have the same ranking. For example, make sure they are not all ranked as `-100`. Rearrange if necessary.
4. Spot-check links to external resources in individual docs , such as links to GitHub pages, APIs, etc.
5. Update the appropriate landing page, or [create a new landing page](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/work-landing-pages).
6. [Redirect](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/processes-procedures/delete-document) the beta TOC hidden doc's URL to the new taxonomy, and delete it.
7. Notify product and support Slack channels that the docs are live.
8. When the product team publishes their release note, make sure it includes doc links and that the RSS feed works.

## Post-publication [#followup]

Tasks may include:

1. Update the [Glossary](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary).
2. Check and update [Swiftype](https://app.swiftype.com/select) (new alias, rank of docs, etc.).
3. Update [translation flags](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/manage-translated-docs#request-translation) if approved.
4. Spot-check links to docs in related blog post at [blog.newrelic.com](https://blog.newrelic.com), Explorers Hub, etc.
5. Add cross references to other docs or resources as needed.
6. Close your Epic and your liaisonship.
