Navigation for [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) is stored in `YAML` files located in the [src/nav](./src/nav) directory. Each top-level navigation should have its own configuration file. 

## The configuration file

Here is a snippet of the [src/nav/insights.yml](./src/nav/insights.yml) configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. Be sure to imitate the same spacing when you make changes:

```yml
title: Insights
children:
  - title: Use Insights UI
    children:
      - title: Getting started
        children:
          - title: Introduction to New Relic Insights
            path: /docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights
      - title: Manage dashboards
        children:
          - title: Chart types
            path: /docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types
          - title: Filter Insights dashboards
            path: /docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/filter-insights-dashboards
          - title: View, organize, share Insights dashboards
            path: /docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/view-organize-share-insights-dashboards
```

## Configuration file options

When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the `.yml` configuration file can have the following properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:200px">Key</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`title`</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>The text that is shown in the navigation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`path`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>The URL path to the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`children`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Any sub-navigation nodes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate `.yml` file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
Each category has its own `index.md` page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly.
