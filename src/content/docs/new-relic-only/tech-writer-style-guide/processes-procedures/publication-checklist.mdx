## Publication checklist [#checklist]

When publishing content, or reviewing the publication of release notes, check the following:

For overall content:

* Review for structural and appearance errors.
* Make sure the URL and any redirects are correct. See [Renaming and redirecting a document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/renaming-redirecting-document).

For new content:

* Review for grammar, spelling, and adherence to style guidelines.
* Make sure all new links are correct.

For new documents, make sure:

* The document is living in the right place. See [Renaming and redirecting a document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/renaming-redirecting-document).
* The document has the correct permissions assigned to it.
* A description and keywords have been set.
* The sort order is correct.

## Check the sort order [#sort-order]

Always confirm sort order when adding or renaming documents. Always use drag and drop to order documents. If items are in order in the **Node order** page but not in the menu, move them out of order and back again. This will force Drupal to renumber all items for that term. This is much easier than worrying about which numbers will and won't work.

  Drag and drop doesn't work if you select **Show row weights**.
</Callout>

Whenever you add a new document or rename an existing doc, Drupal adds to the top list for the assigned taxonomy term. This means it will be the first thing in the menu for that sub-category.

To check the sort order of a document:

1. From the document, select the immediate taxonomy parent in the breadcrumb trail.
2. Select **> Order Nodes**.
3. Make sure the documents are in the right order.
4. Select **Show row weights** to show the row weights.
5. Make sure none are set to zero.
6. Select **Hide row weights** to return to drag and drop interface.
7. Before you check the sort order is the way you want, clear your browser cache.

## Change the sort order [#change-order]

To change the sort order of a document:

1. From the document, select the immediate taxonomy parent in the breadcrumb trail.
2. Select **Order Nodes**.
3. Drag the document to the correct position.
4. Select **Save order**.
5. Before you check the sort order is the way you want, clear your browser cache.
