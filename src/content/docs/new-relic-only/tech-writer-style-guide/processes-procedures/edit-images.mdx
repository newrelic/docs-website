A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. 

Read on for more information about our best practices when creating images.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or send an email to [docs@newrelic.com](mailto:docs@newrelic.com). 
  
  If you're a New Relic employee, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel.
</Callout>

**Important image guidelines:**

* Make sure it provides useful information at a glance
* Include a caption with helpful context for the image
* For screenshot captions, include the path in bold
* For video captions, include the approximate running time

## Create a new image [#creating]

The Docs team uses Snagit to capture screenshots.

Review the Docs style guide for more information on using [callouts](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/callouts), [color highlights](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/design-specifications/color-design-specs), or [cropping](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images).

1. Ask your project team or quality assurance (QA) for accounts in dev or staging that have the scenario you want to screenshot.
2. Sign in with end user permissions so that New Relic-specific or admin features are hidden.
3. Use Snagit to mask names, accounts, or other sensitive information.
4. Save the image as a **.png** file.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To establish context, use screenshots that include menu bars. Once you've established context, for additional screenshots, you can switch to capturing specific page components. This helps save screen real estate and reduces the need for image updates when the interfaces change.
</Callout>

Try to capture screenshots at the smallest window width that still makes the product look attractive. This is somewhat subjective, but will become easier with practice. [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh), [Firefox](//addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/resizeit/), and [Safari](https://mehlau.net/resizewindow/) all have window resizing tools. For mobile apps, you can capture the screen at whatever size it renders.

## Give images unique and meaningful names [#naming]

<Callout variant="important">
  If you upload an image with a duplicate filename, it will replace the file that's there. Make sure you're not overwriting an existing image.
</Callout>

Make image names unique and meaningful. Don't be afraid to make them long. The name **screen-user-email-alert-settings.png** is better than **email-alerts.png** because it identifies the type of image (screenshot), describes the content in the image, and helps with search engine optimazation (SEO).

Here are some more guidelines for naming specific types of images:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Type**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Format**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Screenshots
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix screenshots with "screen-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **screen-apdext-settings.png**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Icons
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix icon with "icon-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **icon-settings-gear.png.**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Charts, diagrams, and tables
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix chart, diagrams, and tables with "chart-", "diagram-", or "table-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **chart-cpu-usage-by-app.png**.
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</Table>

## Edit images in Snagit [#editing]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For a unified library of image masking tools, see the [clip art library](https://newrelic.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Docs+Clip+Art).
</Callout>

After capturing an image, edit it in Snagit.

For example:

* Crop or cut out unnecessary sections. A section is unnecessary if it doesn't add needed context or meaning to your image.
* Use a redaction tool to mask sensitive information. Depending on what works best for you, you can use a square-cornered blur brush or box.
* Use the New Relic Orange Variant color (`#F37760`) as dotted circles or line arrows to highlight important parts of the image.
* Use the Gentle Teal (`#368786`) color in a dotted oval to callout text.
* Make sure annotations don't look like part of the screenshot itself.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For a list of all of our screenshot colors and their CSS and RGB codes, see [Color and design specs: Screenshot colors](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/design-specifications/color-design-specs#snagit_colors).
</Callout>

## Use mobile device frames for app images [#mobile]

For New Relic mobile apps, you can surround the screenshots with a device frame to make them look more like app screenshots:

* iPhone 5 frame for iPhone
* iPad Air for iPad
* Nexus 5 for Android phones

You can download the device frames at [Image size and clip art: Device frames](https://newrelic.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Docs+Clip+Art).


## Update images in use [#updating]

In many cases, you can update an image that's already being used. To do this, download the original image, make your edits, and reupload it to the Docs repository in a pull request.

## For more help [#more_help]

For additional examples of images in documents, see:

* [Using the server monitor UI](/docs/server/using-the-server-monitor-ui) (cropped and masked screenshot, UI buttons, inline icons)
* [Key transactions](/docs/transactions-menu/key-transactions) (screenshot embedded within another to show process)
* [Viewing an x-ray session](/docs/transactions-menu/viewing-an-xray-session) (cropped screenshots with callouts and examples)
