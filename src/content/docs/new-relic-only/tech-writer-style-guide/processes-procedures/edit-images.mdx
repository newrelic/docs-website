<Callout variant="important">
  If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel or send an email to [docs@newrelic.com](mailto:docs@newrelic.com).
</Callout>

**Important image guidelines:**

* Make sure it provides useful information at a glance
* Include a caption with helpful context for the image
* For screenshot captions, include the path in bold
* For video captions, include the approximate running time

## Create a new image [#creating]

The Docs team uses Snagit to capture screenshots.

Review the Docs style guide for more information on using [callouts](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/callouts), [color highlights](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/design-specifications/color-design-specs), or [cropping](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images).

1. Ask your project team or quality assurance (QA) for accounts in dev or staging that have the scenario you want to screenshot.
2. Sign in with end user permissions so that New Relic-specific or admin features are hidden.
3. Use Snagit to mask names, accounts, or other sensitive information.
4. Save the image as a **.png** file.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To establish context, use screenshots that include menu bars. Once you've established context, for additional screenshots, you can switch to capturing specific page components. This helps save screen real estate and reduces the need for image updates when the interfaces change.
</Callout>

Try to capture screenshots at the smallest window width that still makes the product look attractive. This is somewhat subjective, but will become easier with practice. [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh), [Firefox](//addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/resizeit/), and [Safari](https://mehlau.net/resizewindow/) all have window resizing tools. For mobile apps, you can capture the screen at whatever size it renders.

## Give images unique and meaningful names [#naming]

<Callout variant="important">
  Drupal requires unique file names. Uploading an image file with the same name as an existing image will add a number to the new image's name. Keep this in mind when linking directly to an image.
</Callout>

Make image names unique and meaningful. Don't be afraid to make them long. The name **screen-user-email-alert-settings.png** is better than **email-alerts.png** because it identifies the type of image (screenshot), describes the content in the image, and helps with search engine optimazation (SEO).

Here are some more guidelines for naming specific types of images:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Type**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Format**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Screenshots
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix screenshots with "screen-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **screen-apdext-settings.png**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Icons
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix icon with "icon-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **icon-settings-gear.png.**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Charts, diagrams, and tables
      </td>

      <td>
        Prefix chart, diagrams, and tables with "chart-", "diagram-", or "table-" followed by a meaningful, dash separated name.

        Example: **chart-cpu-usage-by-app.png**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Thumbnails
      </td>

      <td>
        Drupal automatically generates thumbnails from the original image, as well as any other size you may need.

        **Inline image:** Use this for any inline content wider than 660 pixels to size it down. This also automatically generates the lightbox popup effect.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Edit images in Snagit [#editing]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For a unified library of image masking tools, see the [clip art library](https://newrelic.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Docs+Clip+Art).
</Callout>

After capturing an image, edit it in Snagit.

For example:

* Crop or cut out unnecessary sections. A section is unnecessary if it doesn't add needed context or meaning to your image.
* Use a redaction tool to mask sensitive information. Depending on what works best for you, you can use a square-cornered blur brush or box.
* Use the New Relic Orange Variant color (`#F37760`) as dotted circles or line arrows to highlight important parts of the image.
* Use the Gentle Teal (`#368786`) color in a dotted oval to callout text.
* Make sure annotations don't look like part of the screenshot itself.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For a list of all of our screenshot colors and their CSS and RGB codes, see [Color and design specs: Screenshot colors](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/design-specifications/color-design-specs#snagit_colors).
</Callout>

## Use mobile device frames for app images [#mobile]

For New Relic mobile apps, you can surround the screenshots with a device frame to make them look more like app screenshots:

* iPhone 5 frame for iPhone
* iPad Air for iPad
* Nexus 5 for Android phones

You can download the device frames at [Image size and clip art: Device frames](https://newrelic.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PD/Docs+Clip+Art).

## Upload an image to the assets library [#upload-to-library]

Images can be uploaded to the assets library making them available for embedding while editing a doc.

1. To upload an image to the **Atoms** libary, go to **Manage > Content > Atoms > + Add atom**.
2. On the Create Atom page, click **Image**.

## Upload an image using the image module [#upload-with-module]

1. To upload an image to the **Atoms** libary, go to **Manage > Content > Atoms > + Add atom**.
2. To upload an image while editing a doc, in the image module, click the **Create a new image atom** button.
3. Upload your image.
4. Leave the filename as the first image, but write content for the alternate text and second title fields, then click **Finish**.

## Update images in use [#updating]

In many cases, you can update an image that's already being used. To do this, download the original image, make your edits, and reupload it:

1. In the Drupal menu bar, click **Manage > Content**. Then click the **Atoms** tab.
2. Filter by **Title** to locate the specific image you want to update. If you're unsure about the title of your image, use your brower's **Inspect element** tool to find the appropriate `title=` field in the HTML of the parent doc where the image lives.
3. Click **View** to see the file in its native resolution.
4. Save the native resolution image locally and use Snagit to make your edits.
5. From the **View** menu, click **Edit**. Click **Remove** to remove the original image from Scald (Don't worry, it's still stored in the Drupal database), then upload your new file. Click **Finish** to save your changes.
