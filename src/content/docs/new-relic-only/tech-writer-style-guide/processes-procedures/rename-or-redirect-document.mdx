This document describes how to change the title of a document and how to create, edit, and delete redirects. Procedures are the same for both standard docs ("basic pages") and release notes.

<Callout variant="caution">
  These procedures are intended for Tech Writer use. Changing titles or updating redirects can create issues with finding content. If you need to change a title or a redirect, create a GitHub issue or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel.
</Callout>

## URL format [#title-url]

Changing a document's title also affects its URL. The URL is the text of the title, where hyphens `-` replace spaces. Drupal automatically removes ["short words"](/admin/config/search/path/settings) (`the`, `a`, `for`, `via`, etc.) from URL paths.

For example, this is the URL for **Rename or redirect a document**:

```
docs/new-relic-only/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-redirect-document
```

## Change titles [#titles]

To change a document title, follow this process carefully to ensure you update the URL and create appropriate redirects:

1. Create a new draft of the doc.
2. In the **Title** field, edit the document title.
3. In the **URL path settings** tab, select the **Generate automatic URL alias** checkbox.
4. In the **Publishing options** tab, summarize your change, then save and publish.

Drupal updates the document title and URL, and creates a redirect from the old URL. To verify that the URL change was successful:

1. Create a new draft of the doc.
2. In the **URL path settings** tab, ensure the URL has changed to the new URL.
3. In the **URL redirects** tab, ensure there is a redirect for the old URL.

If you change a file name and path back to one that previously existed, you may see **Disabled** links in the **URL redirects** tab. These can be safely deleted.

## Change anchor links [#anchors]

Wherever possible, do not change the `id=""` of an H2, table row, or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor `id` is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs.

If you must change an `id`, try to move the existing one to a nearby piece of content. For example, move an old header ID to the first paragraph of the section:

```
<h2 id="new-id">New header with new ID</h2>

<p id="old-id">First paragraph of section</p>
```

## Edit redirects [#redirects]

Use the **URL redirects** tab in the selected doc, or use the Drupal [URL redirects list](/admin/config/search/redirect) (**Menu > Configuration > Search and metadata > URL redirects**) to manage redirect locations.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="create"
    title="Create a redirect to a doc you're editing"
  >
    To create a redirect to an existing doc:

    1. Go to the doc where you want to add a redirect from another doc, and create a new draft.
    2. In the **URL redirects** tab, select **Add URL redirect to this content**.
    3. In the **From** field, specify the path for the doc you want to redirect to this one.
    4. If you want to redirect to a specific anchor tag, place that anchor after the node URL in the **To** field. For example: `node/27016#install-procedures`.
    5. Select **Save**.

    Drupal creates a redirect, then returns to the draft you were editing.

    You do not need to edit the **To** field. Drupal automatically pre-populates it with a permalink to the doc you are currently editing.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="create-arbitrary"
    title="Create a redirect to an arbitrary location"
  >
    You can also create a redirect to an arbitrary location. For example, `docs.newrelic.com/jira` redirects to `newrelic.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=13600`.

    1. In Drupal, go to the [URL redirects list](/admin/config/search/redirect) (**Menu > Configuration > Search and metadata > URL redirects**) and select **Add redirect**.
    2. In the **From** field, specify the relative path that you want to redirect to somewhere else.
    3. In the **To** field, specify the relative internal path or complete external path where you want the redirect to go.
    4. Select **Save**.

    Drupal creates a redirect, then returns to the redirect list.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="edit"
    title="Edit a redirect"
  >
    To edit an existing redirect:

    1. From the doc containing the redirect you want to edit, create a new draft.

       OR

       In Drupal, go to the [URL redirects list](/admin/config/search/redirect) (**Menu > Configuration > Search and metadata > URL redirects**), and filter for the redirect you want to edit.
    2. In the **Operations** column, select **Edit**.
    3. Edit the fields, then select **Save**.

    Drupal updates the redirect, then returns to the previous page.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete"
    title="Delete a redirect"
  >
    To delete an existing redirect:

    1. From the doc containing the redirect you want to delete, create a new draft.

       OR

       In Drupal, go to the [URL redirects list](/admin/config/search/redirect) (**Menu > Configuration > Search and metadata > URL redirects**), and filter for the redirect you want to delete.
    2. In the **Operations** column, select **Delete**.
    3. Select **Confirm**.

    Drupal deletes the redirect, then returns to the previous page.
  </Collapser>
