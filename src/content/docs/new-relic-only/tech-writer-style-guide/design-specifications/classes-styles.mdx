NR ONLY

This document contains the specifications and style rules that have been established for the Documentation site. Follow the rules here to ensure consistency across the pages. Some of these are purely for reference, since they are defined in the style sheets.

## Contents [#qiklinks]

## Clamshells for long pages [#clamshells]

To create a clamshell, you must use the **Source** editor. To edit existing clamshells, you can use **Source** or WYSIWYG; clamshells are identified by a **-- fold --** label in the WYSIWYG editor.

Here is an example of clamshell source:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="clamshell-source"
    title="Clamshell source"
  >
    ```
    <dl class="clamshell-list">

    <dt id="clamshell-1">Clamshell 1</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This is the first example clamshell.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="clamshell-2">Clamshell 2</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This is the second example clamshell.</p>
    </dd>

    </dl>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Clamshells are triggered by:

* Selecting the open buttons or **Show/Hide All**.
* Arriving at an individual clamshell via the URL. For example, go directly to [Clamshell 1 in this example](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/clamshells#clamshell-1).
* Typing the shortcut keys `s` (to **s**how) and `h` (to **h**ide). Useful if user uses CMD/CTRL + F to Find in Page.

## Callouts

Use these [callout classes](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/basic-style-guide/formatting-document-key-points#callouts) to call out important points in a document.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Class
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `callout-caution`
      </td>

      <td>
        Use for a text block beginning with an exclamation triangle <Icon name="fe-alert-triangle"/>
        icon.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `callout-important`
      </td>

      <td>
        Use for a text block beginning with an exclamation circle <Icon name="fe-alert-circle"/>
        icon.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `callout-tip`
      </td>

      <td>
        Use for a text block beginning with a light bulb <Icon name="fe-lightbulb"/>
        icon.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `callout-permissions`
      </td>

      <td>
        Use for a text block to identify one or more New Relic roles, usually Owners and Admins, when the topic (such as access to a part of the UI, ability to delete data, etc.) is available only to those roles.

        ```
        <div class="callout-permissions"><b>Owners and Admins</b></div>
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `callout-pricing`
      </td>

      <td>
        Use for a text block identifying an enhanced New Relic feature that requires a minimum subscription level. Use the following text, and take advantage of the Keyboard Maestro shortcut `kkpricing` to change the Storefront link to the appropriate product's pricing page.

        ```
        <div class="callout-pricing">
          <p>Access to this feature depends on your <a href="http://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing">subscription level</a>.</p>
        </div>
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Here is an example of the `callout` format:

```
<div class="callout-tip">
  <p>Enclose your callouts in division tags.</p>
</div>
```

## Example shells and boxes [#example-box]

Use the [`example-box`](#example-shell) class with a `<dl>` tag to enclose extended examples or [formulas](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-maintenance/account-usage-explore-usage-trends-over-time#apm-daily-usage) in their own type of clamshell. Examples are useful to indicate where the "meat" of a section ends and illustration begins. This is particularly true when the example is so long it makes the parent section appear intimidating, but is not so important that it deserves its own section.

An example shell is essentially a clamshell that looks like a table with an auto-generated header row. Lead each example with a short yet descriptive title (numbered if more than 1) in its `dt` element. All `dt` elements are linkable, including examples or clamshells nested inside a clamshell.

The old [`examplebox`](#old-example-box) class is still available for now, but we may eventually deprecate it.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-shell"
    title="Example #1: Remodeled example shell markup"
  >
    ```
    <dl class="example-box">
       <dt id="example-title">Example title</dt>
       <dd>Example content</dd>
    </dl>
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="old-example-box"
    title="Example #2: Old example box markup"
  >
    ```
    <div class="examplebox">
       <p><b>Title</b></p>
       <p>Example content</p>
    </div>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Watermarks

Use a watermark to signify information that applies to the entire document; for example, `BETA`, `Legacy`, `Deprecated`, `NR ONLY`, etc. The watermark will appear as faded red text in the background.

* Short watermarks such as `NR ONLY`: Use all caps.
* Long watermarks such as `Deprecated`: Use title case.

To include a watermark, wrap the target text in a `div` with `watermark` as the `ID`:

```
<div id="watermark">Watermark</div>
```

If a document needs to include an important warning about its contents as a whole, create an appropriate watermark. Also include additional explanatory text as a `callout-important` or `callout-caution` at the top of the document if needed.

## Code examples

Contain code blocks within `<pre>` tags. In addition, use these tags as needed:

* `<var>`: For delimiting user-entered values
* `<b>`: For emphasis
* `<a>`: For linking to other content

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="code-block-example"
    title="Example: Code blocks"
  >
    **Source:**

    ```
    <pre>
    <b>foo</b> (bar) { <a href="docs/acctAPI">acctAPI</a> <var>yourUserId</var>; }
    </pre>
    ```

    **Result:**

    ```
    foo (bar) { <a href="docs/acctAPI">acctAPI yourUserId; }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Additional tags for the Contents h2 [#magic]

If you assign the class `freq-link` to an `h3` or `dt` tag, the script adds that header to the **Contents** list. The script indents the `h3` or `dt` as a sub-bullet to the parent `h2`. The `freq-link` feature does not work with other tags.

```
<dt class="freq-link" id="example-id">Example title</dt>
```
