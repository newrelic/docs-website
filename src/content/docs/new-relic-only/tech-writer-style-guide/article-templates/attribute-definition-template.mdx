Use this template to document an attribute to appear in the [New Relic event data dictionary](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary).

<Callout variant="important">
  For best results, do not clone an existing attribute doc. Instead, document an attribute from the [**Add attribute definition** template](https://docs.newrelic.com/node/add/attribute-definition). This will make sure that the attribute works properly in the event data dictionary.
</Callout>

## Add an attribute [#create]

To add an attribute to the event data dictionary:

1. Go to **[docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) > Shortcuts > Add attribute definition**.
2. To view or edit the content in HTML, rather than the default WYSIWYG view, select the editor toolbar's **Source** button.
3. Refer to the following definitions to fill in the attribute template, then save.

## Attribute name

**Required.** Enter the name of the attribute, using the exact capitalization in your original source. Individual attributes are associated with one or more events.

## Short description [#short-desc]

**Required.** Write a brief description of the data returned for this attribute. Short descriptions appear in the New Relic Insights when users mouse over the UI.

A good short description is preferably one or two lines long and accurately describes the data. Additional details can be added to the [long description](#long-desc).

## Long description [#long-desc]

Sometimes an attribute needs more context or details, such as OS dependencies, than what is provided in the short description. You can include the detailed information in the long description.

Then, when an attribute includes a long description, the event data dictionary will add a `read more` link to the attribute's short description in the UI. When users click the link, the attribute doc will open so that they can read the long description.

## New Relic event types [#event-type]

**Required.** Every attribute in the event data dictionary must be associated with at least one event type. Attributes are commonly used by more than one event. Use the New Relic event types menu in the template to select the appropriate event(s) for the attribute.

If you are working with an attribute for a new event type, contact `@hero` in the `#documentation` Slack channel to request adding it to the event data dictionary. The name of the event and a description of its use are required to add the event to the event data dictionary and make that event appear on the event types menu.

## Units

Some attributes report data in units of measurements. Units currently include:

* Bytes
* Megabyte
* Seconds
* Milliseconds
* Percentage

If your attribute uses a unit of measurement not included in the menu, contact `@hero` in the `#documentation` Slack channel. Only the Tech Docs team can add the unit to the menu.
