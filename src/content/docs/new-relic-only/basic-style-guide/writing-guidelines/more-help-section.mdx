At the end of every document, include an `##` heading with **For more help** as the heading text:

```
## For more help
```

The Docs site will automatically generate support information as a [footer block](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/page-components/manage-content-footers) in the **For more help** section after your doc is published. The footer block is not visible while your doc is in a draft state.

If you need a new footer block, contact the Docs @hero in the [**#documentation Slack channel**](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/C0DSGL3FZ/).
