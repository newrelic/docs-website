For all headings and document titles, use [sentence case](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/capitalization#heading_caps).

## Use parallel construction [#parallel]

Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns ("Organization," "Tone"), all verbs ("Create," "Delete"), etc.

## Keep it short, avoid -ing words [#short-gerunds]

For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: `Install the agent`, for example, rather than `Agent installation`. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity.

## Do not use h1 headings [#h1_headings]

After you publish your doc, the Docs site will automatically use what you added to the **Title** field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings.

If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, notify the `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/C0DSGL3FZ/) Slack channel. (You must have admin privileges to maintain a doc's **Short title** field.)

## Use h2 headings to identify chunks of information [#h2_identify]

Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (`h2`). For example:

```
<h2 id="create-new-user">Create a new user</h2>
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Assign an ID to every h2, h3, and collapser in the document. If your ID has more than one word, use hyphens `-` between the words, not spaces or underscores. For example: `<h2 id="install-apm">Install the APM agent<h2>`.
</Callout>

If you have too many h2 sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages.

## Avoid using h3 headings [#h3]

Avoid using h3 headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about h3s that make an h2 section longer than a single screen height.

Here are two examples of good scenarios for using h3s:

* Example #1: [Events-to-metrics API doc](/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api#operations)
* Example #2: [Infrastructure integration doc](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mysql-monitoring-integration#metrics)

<Callout variant="tip">
  By default, h3s don't show up in the sidebar table of contents. To include them, include a `class="freq-link"` inside the h3:

  ```
  <h3 id="configure-fred" class="freq-link">Configure with Fred</h3>
  ```
</Callout>
