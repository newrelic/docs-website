<Callout variant="important">
  If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs `@hero` in the [#documentation Slack channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation/).
</Callout>

For detailed information about how to work with the Tech Docs team, see the [Docs starter kit in NerdLife](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/our-departments/product/experience-design/docs-starter-kit).

## Create new docs [#creating-docs]

You can use [article templates](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/article-templates) or [clone an existing doc](#clone-doc) as a template. To create a new doc for the Drupal Docs site:

1. From your Okta login, select the **Docs** tile.
2. From the Drupal menu bar, select **Shortcuts**. Then select a doc type:

   * **Add basic page**: A standard doc. If you don't know what to pick, select this.
   * **Add release notes**: Agent and product release notes.
   * **Add platform release notes**: UI and other SaaS-related release notes.
   * **Add API doc**: Reference docs for individual API methods.

   **Exception:** To create a new [troubleshooting doc](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/article-templates/troubleshooting-docs-guide): From the Drupal menu bar, select **My workbench > Create content > [Troubleshooting doc](/node/add/troubleshooting-doc)**.
3. Specify a **Title** (for example, `Install .NET for xxx`).
4. Select the **Page Location** from the dropdowns (for example, `APM Agents & .NET Agent > Install`).
5. Add your content in the **Body**.
6. Set the moderation state.
   * To save your draft for later, keep the moderation state as **Draft**.
   * To request your draft be published, select **Ready for Publication**.
   * To publish a release note automatically, select **Published**.
7. Select **Save**.

Drupal automatically places docs saved as **Ready for Publication** in a moderation queue and notifies the Tech Docs `@hero`. The hero will review your content and notify you when it's published. The time needed to publish is based on [our SLAs](https://newrelic.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-6286#jive_content_id_When_should_you_contact_us).

## Clone (copy) an existing doc [#clone-doc]

You can clone (copy) an existing doc, then rename and edit the clone, and save it as a new doc.

1. From your Okta login, select the **Docs** tile, then select the existing doc that you want to copy.
2. From the doc you want to clone: Below the **Page tools** menu bar, select **Clone content**.
3. Rename the cloned doc, and continue editing.
4. Check whether the doc you want to clone [has already been translated](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/manage-translated-docs#translation-status). If yes, contact the Tech Docs `@hero` in the [#documentation Slack channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/C0DSGL3FZ/), and request to have your cloned doc's status changed to `None`.

If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to [request translation](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/manage-translated-docs#request-translation).

Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's short (sidebar) title. When you save your new doc as `Ready for Publication`, the Tech Docs hero will need to change your new doc's short title to something meaningful.

## Edit and publish existing content [#editing-existing]

To edit existing content in the Drupal Docs site:

1. From your Okta login, select the **Docs** tile.
2. Locate the document you want to edit.
3. For the doc you want to change, select **Edit** (for new edits), or **Edit Draft** (to update a work in progress).
4. Set the moderation state:
   * To save your draft for later, keep the moderation state as **Draft**.
   * To request your draft be published, select **Ready for Publication**.
   * To publish a release note automatically, select **Published**.
5. Select **Save**.

Docs set to **Ready for Publication** get placed in a moderation queue. The Tech Docs hero will review your content and notify you when it's published. The time needed to publish is based on [our SLAs](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/our-departments/product/experience-design/docs-starter-kit#jive_content_id_When_should_you_contact_us).

## Request a future publication date [#hold-for-release]

You can either save a doc as a **Draft** or as **Ready for Publication**. The **Ready for Publication** state automatically notifies the Tech Docs team, who will then review and publish your changes.

However, there may be times when you finish your edits but do not want the Tech Docs team to publish immediately. For example, your updates may need to coincide with an agent release or a new feature launch.

To have your edits published at a future date, do not save as **Ready for Publication**. Instead:

1. At the bottom of the draft, select **Publishing options**.
2. Use the **Moderation notes** to describe why or when to hold. For example, `Do not publish until PHP agent x.x.x release`.
3. Save as **Draft**.
4. Notify the Tech Docs `@hero` in the [#documentation Slack channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation/) that you want to delay publication.

The Tech Docs hero will follow up with you to get any additional details needed. The Tech Docs hero will also save your draft as **Hold for Release**. Anyone can continue editing the doc, but it will not be published until you or your team notify the Tech Docs `@hero` that the **Hold for Release** flag can be removed.

## Add or update license documentation [#license-docs]

To add or update New Relic license information, follow [standard procedures](#editing-workflow) to add or update documentation in the appropriate [**Licenses** category](/docs/licenses) on the [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com).
