This is a guide to common usage on [**docs.newrelic.com**](https://docs.newrelic.com) and is intended primarily as a tech writer reference to ensure consistency across the Docs site. Except for terms and concepts listed in this document and our style guide, we generally follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), with a fallback to the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions rather than British English.

For a dictionary of New Relic terminology, [see the public glossary](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary) on the Docs site.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="account-id"
    title="account ID"
  >
    A unique number that [identifies a particular New Relic account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id). Do not refer to as `account number`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agent"
    title="agent"
  >
    Do not capitalize. `Install the Ruby agent`, not `Install the Ruby Agent`.

    Do not refer to a Synthetics [`private minion`](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions) as an `agent`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ampm"
    title="am and pm"
  >
    * Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm.
    * Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am).
    * Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10.

    ```
    9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aws"
    title="Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names"
  >
    Refer to the specific product, not just `AWS` broadly.

    * At first occurrence in your doc, always refer to the full Amazon Web Services (AWS) product name spelled out completely. **Example:** `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud`.
    * After that, use the short name according to the [AWS Documentation site](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). **Example:** `Amazon EC2`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="app-name"
    title="app name vs. app alias"
  >
    The "machine name" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its `app name`. The server-side config setting that changes the visible "name" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its `app alias`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="beta"
    title="beta"
  >
    When using as a [watermark](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/design-specifications/classes-styles#watermarks) or in the doc's title, use all caps:

    ```
    <div id="watermark">BETA</div>
    ```

    Do not include a callout within the document unless the beta requires additional explanation. In body text, use lower case. For example:

    ```
    <div class="callout-important">
    <p>This feature currently is in private beta. To join the beta, contact your New Relic account rep.</p>
    </div>
    ```

    If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary.

  <Collapser
    id="byte"
    title="bits and bytes"
  >
    Use [standard prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) and capitalization for International System of Units [(SI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix), International Organization for Standardization [(ISO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council [(JEDEC memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards#Unit_prefixes_for_semiconductor_storage_capacity) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits.

  <Collapser
    id="black-white"
    title="blacklist and whitelist"
  >
    Do not use. Instead, use `deny list` and `allow list`; for example, "Add a hostname to your deny list." For more information, see the [NerdLife post](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/stop-blacklisting-and-whitelisting-its-awful-and-unnecessary).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="caps"
    title="capitalization"
  >
    For detailed information, see:

    * [Heading capitalization](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/levels-headings#heading_caps)
    * [Capitalization of features and UI elements](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/capitalization#features)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="click"
    title="click"
  >
    In general, use `click` rather than the vaguer `select`.

    Be particularly careful to use `click` to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a [`right-click`](https://docs.newrelic.com/node/7236/revisions/231186/view#right-click) or a `click and drag`. Also use `click` when the user must click on a non-selectable object (`to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box`). See also [mouse over](https://docs.newrelic.com/node/7236/revisions/231186/view#mouse-over).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collector"
    title="collector vs. connect to New Relic"
  >
    When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector). Although internally the `collector` refers only to specific parts of our architecture, the documentation uses it more broadly to mean "any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product." Avoid "connect to New Relic," and do not use "connect to the New Relic UI."
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="contractions"
    title="contractions"
  >
    When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority.

    There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, `it's` for `it is` is fine, but less common constructions like `mustn't` or `wouldn't've` are best avoided.

    Also:

    * When using a negative contraction (`don't`, `can't`, `won't`) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the [style guide intro](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/introduction-style-guide#tone) for more on this.)
    * There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out `do not`, `cannot`, or `will not` is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboard"
    title="dashboard"
  >
    Do not use, except with Insights or deprecated custom dashboards. Instead, use [`page`](#pages).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="document"
    title="doc, document, documentation"
  >
    Avoid referring to the document itself (the docs site page) as much as possible. If there's not a good alternative, you can use `doc`, `document`, or `documentation` (whatever sounds most natural; try reading it aloud).

    For example, `This document explains how to...` or `For related docs, see...`
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dropdown"
    title="dropdown"
  >
    Use `dropdown` instead of `drop-down` or `drop down`. Although it is not common usage, you can use `dropdown` independently as a noun, without needing to say `dropdown menu` or `dropdown list`. For example, `select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="eg"
    title="e.g. and i.e."
  >
    Do not use Latin abbreviations. Instead of `e.g.`, use `for example` or `such as`. Instead of `i.e.` or its English equivalent `in other words`, rewrite so your description is clear.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="em-dash"
    title={<>em dash (<InlineCode>—</InlineCode>)</>}
  >
    Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences, or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice.

    If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example:

    ```
    You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number.
    ```

    You can insert an em dash with the `COMMAND+OPTION+-` shortcut or [use the HTML entity](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Common_HTML_entities_used_for_typography).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="etc"
    title="etc."
  >
    Permitted (unlike the Latin abbreviations [`e.g.`](#eg) or [`i.e.`](#ie)). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples. For example, `cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc.` but not `cities including Portland, etc.`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="hostname"
    title="hostname"
  >
    One word, do not hyphenate.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="icons"
    title="icons"
  >
    When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, then end with the word `icon`. For example, `select the delete` `icon`. Do not put icons in bold.

    When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example:

    * Yes: Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
      icon.
    * No: Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
      icon.

    For technical information on embedding images, see [Inserting inline images](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/embedding-images#inline-images) and [Embedding Font Awesome icons](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/embedding-images#icons).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="index"
    title="index"
  >
    A list of entities, such as the [APM applications index](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-your-applications-index), the [Synthetics Monitors index](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/dashboards/synthetics-monitors-index-access-your-monitors), or the [Alerts Incidents index](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history-incidents-index). See also [`page`](#pages).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="infrastructure"
    title="infrastructure"
  >
    Do not use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as `architecture`, `environment`, `system`, `host`, etc.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="introduction"
    title="introduction"
  >
    Always use `Introduction to` for overview docs for a particular product. For example, `Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure` or `Introduction to the PHP agent` or `Introduction to transaction traces`.

    Do not use `welcome to`, `basics`, `intro`, `overview`, etc. Also avoid the `Thing: Tagline` format, as in `X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions`, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="macos"
    title="macOS"
  >
    The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is `macOS`. Do not use the older product names `Mac OS X` or `OS X`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="master-account"
    title="master account"
  >
    The primary account in a New Relic account with [sub-accounts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/create-sub-accounts). Refer to a master's subordinate accounts as `sub-accounts`, not `children` or `slaves`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="menu"
    title="menu"
  >
    The list of [`pages`](#pages) and [`indexes`](#index) on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mouse-over"
    title="mouse over"
  >
    For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse over an area, but not selecting it. For example, the APM **Overview** page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use `point to` or `hover over`. See also [`click`](#click).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dotnet"
    title=".NET"
  >
    Always refer to the agent and language as `.NET`, never as `.Net` or `.net` or `dotnet`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-relic-one"
    title="New Relic One"
  >
    [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com) is not a product; it's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts.

    This has several implications for how we should refer to it:

    * Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform; some New Relic features are available in the original locations (APM, Browser, Mobile, Insights), and some features are available in New Relic One.
    * Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying "Use New Relic One workloads to...", you could instead say, "In New Relic, you can use workloads to..." and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to "The programmable New Relic One platform," we might say, "The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) and..."
    * Do not use `NR1` or `nr1` as an abbreviation of `New Relic One`. The only reason to use `nr1` is when referring to the `nr1` package or library (for example: a reference to the command `nr1 nerdpack:serve`).

    For more details, see the [New Relic One messaging guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AB2OzkoNhi6clq6xdQzadzG2dDc6ZnIkRRBOxUEb7JQ/edit#), the docs [glossary entry](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#new-relic-one), or the [New Relic One docs](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="node-js"
    title="Node.js"
  >
    Always refer to the programming language as `Node.js`, not `Node`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nr-only"
    title="NR ONLY"
  >
    Use `NR ONLY` for [watermarking docs](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/design-specifications/classes-styles#watermarks) for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Do not use `NR-ONLY` or `NRONLY` or `New Relic Only`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="oxford-comma"
    title="Oxford comma"
  >
    See [serial comma](#serial-comma).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="open-source"
    title="open source"
  >
    Use lower case for `open source`. Although some legal contracts may require upper case, the doc site should use lower case for `open source`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="pages"
    title="page"
  >
    A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast [`index`](#index), [`menu`](#menu), and [`UI`](#ui). Do not use [`dashboard`](#dashboard), `menu`, `tab`, `screen`, or similar terms.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="parent-account"
    title="parent account"
  >
    Do not use. See [`master account`](#master-account).
  </Collapser>

    See [User-related language](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/user-related-language-styles-recommended-phrasings).

    For pricing tier language, see [Pricing language](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/pricing-related-language).

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="real-user-monitoring"
    title="real user monitoring (RUM)"
  >
    Do not use outside of Browser docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for Browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as `page load timing` (in Browser docs) or `New Relic Browser` (in non-Browser docs). Within Browser docs, use this term only for SEO or clarification, never to refer to the actual feature.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="record"
    title="record vs. report vs. collect"
  >
    Use `report` when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, "your host reports data to New Relic."

    Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use "the reported metrics" or "the collected data."

    If "report" sounds too clunky, you can also use `collect` as long as whatever New Relic is collecting does not sound security sensitive.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="rpm"
    title="RPM"
  >
    Do not refer to the New Relic UI as `RPM`. Always refer to the specific product, such as the `APM UI` or the `Browser UI`. However, you may use `rpm` when required in the visible URL string in [UI paths](#ui-path).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="serial-comma"
    title="serial comma"
  >
    Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, `Portland, Seattle, and Dublin` rather than `Portland, Seattle and Dublin`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="time-zone"
    title="time zone"
  >
    Include a space (time zone). Do not hyphenate, or run together as timezone.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ui"
    title="UI"
  >
    The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its [`pages`](#pages), [`menus`](#menu), and [`indexes`](#index). See also [UI paths](#ui-path).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ui-path"
    title="UI paths"

    If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our [style guide page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/ui-paths) on UI paths.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update"
    title="update vs. upgrade"
  >
    Use `update` when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed in these scenarios.

    Use `upgrade` whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="users"
    title="users"
  >
    For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see [User-related style](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/user-related-language-styles-recommended-phrasings).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="username"
    title="username, not user name"
  >
    One word (`username`), not two. [This is the most common usage](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%22user%20name%22,%22username%22), and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="version"
    title="version number references"
  >
    When referring to multiple version numbers, always use `or higher`. Do not use `and higher`, or the words `greater` or `later`. Also do not use punctuation, as in `version 1.2+`. For example:

    ```
    Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher.
    ```

    In addition:

    * Tell users to use the `latest version`, not an `up-to-date` or `current` version.
    * To abbreviate the word `version`, use a lowercase `v` with no space before the number; for example, `v2` or `v1.2.3`.
    * Use `update` not `upgrade` when talking about agent versions, as in "To update to the latest version..."
    * For security reasons, **do not** use version numbers with licensing docs.

    The Tech Docs team does not have a set standard when referring to previous versions. **Recommendation:**

    * Consider using `version x.x or lower` when identifying a specific version.
    * Consider using `In earlier agent versions` when referring to versions more vaguely.

    Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this:

    ```
    New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout.
    ```

    Instead, write something like this:

    ```
    Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration.
    ```

    OR

    ```
    We recommend setting a startup timeout.
    ```

    We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction, and it helps users to understand procedures.

    However, avoid using generic “you” or “your” when permissions are involved. For example, we can't just say “you can add and remove users from your account settings” when that is actually an Owner or Admin level capability. When permissions are relevant, use a [permissions callout](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/callouts#tr-permissions).
