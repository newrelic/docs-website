NR ONLY

Clamshells are expandable elements that hide page content until you [trigger it open](#trigger-clamshell). Use clamshells to hide content in very long documents. Here is an example clamshell:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="clamshell-1"
    title="Clamshell 1"
  >
    This is our first example clamshell.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="clamshell-2"
    title="Clamshell 2"
  >
    This is our second example clamshell.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Here are some examples of when to use clamshells in your document.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Clamshells are useful for...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Example**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Long lists
      </td>

      <td>
        Here are examples when you have a long list of definitions, such as configuration values, API calls, or parameters:

        * [Writing scripted browsers](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/writing-scripted-browsers)
        * [.NET agent configuration](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Multiple options
      </td>

      <td>
        Here is an example when you have multiple options, such as a procedure with steps that vary depending on your application environment: [Collecting PMI metrics](/docs/agents/java-agent/frameworks/websphere-installation-java#collecting-pmi).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Large code blocks
      </td>

      <td>
        Here is an example when you have a code block that is longer than about one screen height: [Writing API tests](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/writing-api-tests#get).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Subdividing H2s
      </td>

      <td>
        Here is an example when you want a cleaner substitute for `h3` tags when subdividing an `h2` header: [Installing the PHP agent manually](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php#manual). Unlike an `h3`, clamshells allow users to see all the options within a section at a glance without having to scroll.

## Create a clamshell [#create]

To create a clamshell, you must use the **Source** editor. To edit existing clamshells, you can use **Source** or WYSIWYG. Clamshells are identified by a **-- fold --** label in the WYSIWYG editor.

Here is an example of clamshell source:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="clamshell-source"
    title="Clamshell source"
  >
    ```
    <dl class="clamshell-list">

    <dt id="clamshell-1">Clamshell 1</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This is the first example clamshell.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="clamshell-2">Clamshell 2</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This is the second example clamshell.</p>
    </dd>

    </dl>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Clamshells triggers [#trigger-clamshell]

Clamshells will open or close by:

* Selecting the open buttons or **Show/Hide All**.
* Arriving at an individual clamshell via the URL. For example, go directly to [Clamshell 1 in the example above](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/clamshells#clamshell-1).
* Typing the shortcut keys `s` (to **s**how) and `h` (to **h**ide).
