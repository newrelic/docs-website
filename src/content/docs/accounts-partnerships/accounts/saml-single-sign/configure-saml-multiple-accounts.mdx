  These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate). For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso).

In the SAML protocol, the **entity ID** uniquely identifies the service provider (New Relic) to your SAML provider. New Relic's default entity ID is `rpm.newrelic.com`. This is sufficient if you have only a single SAML-enabled account.

When you configure multiple New Relic accounts with SAML, your SAML provider typically requires each account to have a unique entity ID. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities, use New Relic's custom entity ID feature.

## Requirements

For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see [Requirements](/docs/accounts/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers#requirements).

## Select custom entity IDs [#custom]

New Relic's custom entity ID feature allows you to enable a unique entity ID for each of your accounts. You can then configure SAML SSO for them as a distinct application with your SAML provider. This allows you to centrally control user authentication to each of your accounts independently.

To select custom entity IDs:

1. Follow [standard procedures](/docs/subscriptions/setting-up-sso) to set up SSO.
2. In addition, from the **Entity ID** row on the **Step 1. Configure** page, select **Use custom entity ID**.

<Callout variant="important">
  You must use the same entity ID to configure the application's setting with your SAML provider. Some SAML providers require you to create a new application configuration when changing the entity ID.
