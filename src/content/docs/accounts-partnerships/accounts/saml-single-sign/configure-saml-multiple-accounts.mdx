In the SAML protocol, the **entity ID** uniquely identifies the service provider (New Relic) to your SAML provider. New Relic's default entity ID is `rpm.newrelic.com`. This is sufficient if you have only a single SAML-enabled account.

When you configure multiple New Relic accounts with SAML, your SAML provider typically requires each account to have a unique entity ID. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities, use New Relic's custom entity ID feature.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Access to this feature depends on your [subscription level](http://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing).
</Callout>

## Select custom entity IDs

New Relic's custom entity ID feature allows you to enable a unique entity ID for each of your accounts. You can then configure SAML SSO for them as a distinct application with your SAML provider. This allows you to centrally control user authentication to each of your accounts independently.

To select custom entity IDs:

1. Follow [standard procedures](/docs/subscriptions/setting-up-sso) to set up SSO.
2. In addition, from the **Entity ID** row on the **Step 1. Configure** page, select **Use custom entity ID**.

<Callout variant="important">
  You must use the same entity ID to configure the application's setting with your SAML provider. Some SAML providers require you to create a new application configuration when changing the entity ID.
</Callout>
