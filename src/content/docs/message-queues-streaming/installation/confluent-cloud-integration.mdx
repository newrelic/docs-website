New Relic offers an integration for collecting your [Confluent Cloud managed streaming for Apache Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Prerequisites

* A New Relic account
* An active Confluent Cloud account
* A Confluent Cloud API key and secret
* `MetricsViewer` access on the Confluent Cloud account

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, go to <DNT>**Integrations & Agents**</DNT>, select <DNT>**Confluent Cloud -> API Polling**</DNT> and follow the instructions.

<Callout variant="important">
If you have IP Filtering set up, add the following IP addresses to your filter. 
* `162.247.240.0/22`
* `152.38.128.0/19`

For more information about  New Relic IP ranges for cloud integration, refer [this document](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#webhooks). 
For instructions to perform this task, refer [this document](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/security/access-control/ip-filtering/manage-ip-filters.html).
</Callout>




## Configuration and polling [#polling]


Default polling information for the Confluent Cloud Kafka integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Confluent Cloud data interval: 1 minute

You can change the polling frequency only during the initial configuration. 

## View and use data [#find-data]


You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the following [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics-in-service-levels):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity
      </th>

      <th>
        Data type
      </th>

      <th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration records Amazon Managed Kafka data for cluster, partition, and topic entities.
