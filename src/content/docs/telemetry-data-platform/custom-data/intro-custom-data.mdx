metaDescription: "An introduction to reporting custom data to New Relic: why you'd want to do that, and how to start."

To get the most out of New Relic, you may need or want to report custom data to help you get insights about your environment and the unique challenges your organization faces. 

## Options for custom data [#options]

We have a wide variety of [agents and integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations) that bring in various types of data. But you may need to bring in data that isn't reported by default. 

Options for bringing in custom data include: 

* Use our [open source telemetry integrations](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relics-open-source-telemetry-integrations). We have integrations for reporting data from OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, DropWizard, Prometheus, and more. 
* Configure our agents to send custom data. If you're using one of our APM agents, browser agents, or mobile agents, you can configure them to send custom data. To learn more, see the docs for the tool you're using. 
* Create your own solution for reporting telemetry data with our language-specific [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/telemetry-sdks-report-custom-telemetry-data). Or use the underlying APIs directly: [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-metric-api), [Trace API](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api), [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api), [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api). 
* Report data from your operating system or network. If you're using our infrastructure agent, you might want to use our [Flex integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration), which lets you use simple config files to report data.  
* Build a [New Relic One application](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application). You can build an app that lives on our platform, that can be shared with your team or the public, and that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. You can analyze New Relic data, or bring in whatever data you want.
