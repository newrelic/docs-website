## The value of New Relic [#value]

The Telemetry Data Platform:

* Provides an elastic, scalable, highly-performant data platform for your entire stack.
* Eliminates data silos, accelerates mean time to detection (MTTD) and resolution (MTTR), and enables tool consolidation by providing one place to collect and explore your [metrics, events, logs, and traces](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types).
* Accelerates time-to-value with an enterprise-grade SaaS platform that doesn’t require additional infrastructure, hardware, or experts to set up, operate, and maintain additional systems.
* Enables you to explore your operational data through [easy-to-build charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data) and [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), including support for visualizing [Prometheus](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration) data in [Grafana](/docs/integrations/grafana-integrations/get-started/grafana-support-prometheus-promql).
* Provides over 350 out-of-the-box integrations for ingesting data from open source tools, such as Prometheus, Telegraf, FluentD, and Logstash, in addition to New Relic’s best-in-class agents.
* Empowers you to [build New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) to connect system performance to unique business needs, such as business KPIs and customer engagement.

## Capabilities

New Relic's capabilities are organized into several areas:

* **Data**: All of your systems’ telemetry data — [metrics, events, logs, and traces](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) — connected in one platform to eliminate silos and scale efficiently.
* **Analytics**: [Query any data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) collected with lightning fast response time, to get quick answers to questions as they arise, using familiar query patterns for the different data types.
* **Dashboards**: [Visualize data](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) in ways that help software development and IT teams ensure uptime and performance, gain operational efficiency, and accelerate time to market.
* **Alerts**: Find out about problems with [real-time notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow) based on metrics and thresholds you care about.
* **Programmability**: [Build custom New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) to connect your system performance to unique business needs, such as business KPIs and customer engagement.
