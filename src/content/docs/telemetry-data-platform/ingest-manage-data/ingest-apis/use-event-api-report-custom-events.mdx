The New Relic Event API is one way to report [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper [API endpoints for EU region accounts](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center#endpoints).
</Callout>

* For how to add attributes to existing events, see [Add custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes).
* Check out New Relic University’s tutorial [Adding custom events with the Event API](https://newrelic.wistia.com/medias/d530wfeqyo) (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course [Custom data](https://learn.newrelic.com/custom-data-with-insights).

## Basic workflow

The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency.

To send a custom event to your New Relic account:

1. [Register](#register) an Insert API key.
2. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of [reserved terms used by NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insights-custom-data-requirements-limits#reserved-words).
3. [Generate JSON](#instrument) for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method.
4. [Submit a compressed JSON payload](#submit-event) (for example, `gzip` or `deflate`) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a **POST** request.
5. **Recommendation:** Set up [NRQL alert conditions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) to notify you when [parsing errors](#errors-parsing) occur.

This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API.

The Event API [limits the size, rate, and characters](#limits) allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](#verify) or create a new custom event.

## Register an Insert API key [#register]

You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys.

<Callout variant="important">
  Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it.
</Callout>

You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources.

To register an Insert API key:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and then click **Account settings**.
2. Click **API keys** and click **Insights insert keys**.
3. Next to the **Insert keys** heading, select the <Icon name="fe-plus"/>
   symbol and follow the instructions.

The **Insert key** page lists the [curl command](#submit-event) necessary to add event data for the key.

<Callout variant="caution">
  For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI.
</Callout>

## Format the JSON [#instrument]

The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed.

    Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two **Purchase** type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array.

    ```
    [
      {
        "eventType":"Purchase",
        "account":3,
        "amount":259.54
      },
      {
        "eventType":"Purchase",
        "account":5,
        "amount":12309,
        "product":"Item"
      }
    ]
    ```

    When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are [properly formatted](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="limits"
    title="Limits and restricted characters"
  >
    The following size and rate limits apply to events sent to the Event API:

    * Payload total size: **1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST**. We highly recommend using compression.
    * The payload must be encoded as **UTF-8**.
    * Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum
    * Length of attribute name: 255 characters
    * Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length
    * There are rate [limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute](#post-limit) sent to the Event API.

    Some specific attributes have additional restrictions:

    * `accountId`: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest.
    * [`appId`](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/find-product-id#apm): Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest.
    * `eventType`: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, `_` underscores, and `:` colons.
    * `timestamp`: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds.

</CollapserGroup>

## Submit the custom event [#submit-event]

Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The **Insert key** page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses `gzip`, but you can also use `deflate`.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="numberone"
    title="Linux/bash example"
  >
    ```
    gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
    -H "X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE" -H "Content-Encoding: gzip" 
    https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @-
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="numbertwo"
    title="Windows/PowerShell example"
  >
    ```
    $accountId = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
    $insertkey = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    # Replace with your custom event for the body
    $body = '[{"eventType": "powershell", "account": 4, "amount": 123, "fileLocation": "c:\\temp2", "zipped": "true" }]'

    $headers = @{} 
    $headers.Add("X-Insert-Key", "$insertkey") 
    $headers.Add("Content-Encoding", "gzip")


    $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
    $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body)

    $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new()
    $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress)

    $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length)
    $gzipStream.Close()
    $gzipBody = $output.ToArray()

    Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody  "https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events"
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

<Callout variant="important">
  Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing.
</Callout>

Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is [properly formatted](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes), including:

* The `X-Insert-Key` contains the correct Insert API key.
* The `Content-Type` is `application/json`.
* The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests.

The API supports [HTTP/1.1 persistent connections](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html). This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads.

## Verify or troubleshoot request response [#verify]

The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests:

1. The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size.
2. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors.

All successful submissions receive a `200` response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a `uuid`, which is a unique ID created for each request. The `uuid` also appears in any error events created for the request.

Other potential issues:

* 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out.
* Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times.

**Recommendation:** In addition to checking for a success message, use the [Insights data explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/event-explorer-query-chart-your-event-data) to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries.

    Parsing errors occur if:

    * An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an `NrIntegrationError` event, and process the rest.
    * The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data.

    Payloads with parsing errors receive a `200` response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new `NrIntegrationError` event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message.

    To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages.

## Query and alert with NrIntegrationError [#nrIntegration]

The `NrIntegrationError` event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. **Recommendation:** To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, [create a NRQL condition](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) for `NrIntegrationError`. Use this example NRQL query:

```
SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException'
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

    <tr>
      <td id="timestamp">
        `timestamp`
      </td>

      <td>
        The timestamp when the request was received. The `timestamp` attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch.

        Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created.

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newRelicFeature`

## Find your data [#find-data]

To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), you would run:

```
SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT
```

For more on how to query, see [Query data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

## Limit on HTTP requests [#post-limit]

The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is **not** a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.)

This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you.

If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume.

This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, [contact technical support](https://support.newrelic.com/).
