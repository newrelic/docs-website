When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free.

  This doc is for accounts on our [New Relic One pricing plan](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see [Original data retention](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-based-pricing/overview-data-retention-components). Not sure which you're on? See [Overview of pricing and account/user structure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-our-new-pricing-plan-user-model).

The **Data ingestion** page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. **Since 30 days ago** is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span.

The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs.

If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the [sample queries in the usage docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts#data-queries).

From the **Login** drop-down, select **Manage your data**, and then select **Data ingestion**. This is the **Data ingestion** page with data source and account views.

## Data ingestion sources [#sources-list]

The **Data ingestion** page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here.

        Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw

        Metric group: `MetricsBytes`

        Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days.

        You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups.

## Set alerts for data use [#set-alerts]

[Query and alert on usage data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts) describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system.

## Adjust your data ingest [#adjust-ingest]

**Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance**

On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional [data dropping](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/drop-data-using-nerdgraph) rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see [Drop data with drop filter rules](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules).

**Turn off agents and integrations**

If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.
