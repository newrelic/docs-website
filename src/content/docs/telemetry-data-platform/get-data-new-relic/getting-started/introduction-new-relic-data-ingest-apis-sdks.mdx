There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our [Telemetry Data Platform](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform).

## New Relic-built agents and integrations [#integrations]

When you enable New Relic solutions like [APM](/docs/apm), [browser monitoring](/docs/browser), [mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring), [infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure), or any of our wide array of [integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations), by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities.

To browse all New Relic-built tools and solutions, see [New Relic integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations).

## Agent APIs

Some of our monitoring solutions come with APIs and/or SDKs that allow you to customize the data reported and how it reports. For more information, see the relevant product:

* [APM agent APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis#apm-api)
* [Browser API](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis#browser-api)
* [Mobile API](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis#mobile-api)
* Infrastructure monitoring: the [Flex integration tool](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration)

## Telemetry SDKs [#telemetry-sdk]

If our [more curated solutions](#integrations) don't work for you, our open source [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic) let you build your own solution. These SDKs are language wrappers for our data-ingest APIs (below) that let you send telemetry data to New Relic without requiring install of an agent.

## APIs for sending metrics, traces, logs, and events [#data-ingest-apis]

If our more curated solutions don't work for you, we also have data-ingest APIs:

* [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api)
* [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api)
* [Metric API](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api)
* [Log API](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/log-api/introduction-log-api)

To learn about the differences between these data types, see [Data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types).

## New Relic One applications [#new-relic-one-apps]

You can build entirely custom applications that reside in New Relic One and make use of any data you want. You can use existing open source New Relic One apps, or share your own with the open source community. For details, see [New Relic One applications](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application).
