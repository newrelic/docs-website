The user interface for New Relic's Android app provides functionality similar to New Relic's standard user interface, with customized details for mobile users.

## Compatibility and requirements [#reqs]

* Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher
* Screen size of 7 inches or less

## Install New Relic's mobile app [#installation]

You can install the New Relic Android app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newrelic.rpm "Link opens in a new window") or learn more from the [New Relic website](https://newrelic.com/mobility). Follow standard procedures to install any Android app, then sign in with your New Relic user name (account email) and password if applicable.

Depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or [user authentication](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-mobile-apps/authentication-alerts/user-settings-authentication) steps may be required.

## Features [#features]

The New Relic Android app includes data about these features:

* APM metrics, both real-time and [historical](#time) data, including health maps. Select the transaction <Icon name="fe-repeat"/>
  icon to see detailed transaction metrics, or an **Overview** chart to view summary charts of your top five transactions. Select the <Icon name="fe-filter"/>
  icon to filter by [labels and categories](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/labels-categories-organize-your-apps-servers).
* Browser monitoring metrics, including average page load time, Apdex, average throughput, and more.
* Infrastructure monitoring.
* Mobile monitoring, including [crash reports](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-dashboards/mobile-apps-crash-dashboard), network errors, API calls, and active user count.
* Event notifications, including [mobile alerts](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-ios-app/features/ios-alerting) wherever you are, plus [deployment notifications](/docs/applications-menu/deployments-dashboard) and [notes](/docs/site/public-and-private-notes).

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic's Android app doesn't have the full feature set of the New Relic web interface. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser.

See below for details on how to use specific features of the app:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="synthetics"
    title="Synthetics"
  >
    You can use the Android app to view your [synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics) data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. To view more detailed charts, select the caret <Icon name="fe-chevron-down"/>
    icon.

    You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alerts"
    title="Alerts"
  >
    When you log in to your New Relic account from the Android app, your device is automatically associated with your [user channel](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#user). Then, you can [add your user channel to your target policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#mobile-push) to receive alerts.

    For Android alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen. To view them, tap the alert event.

    You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all **Critical** events end.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobile-apps"
    title="Mobile monitoring"
  >
    If you have installed mobile monitoring, you can monitor its performance directly from your Android device. Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="time"
    title="Setting time range"
  >
    When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame with the [time picker](/docs/site/timepicker-setting-time-periods-to-view-data).

    * To move back and forth across the timeline, scrub the New Relic charts.
    * To change the duration of the visible time slice, select the clock <img style={{ width: '22px', height: '20px'}} class="inline" title="icon-ios-apm-clock" alt="icon-ios-apm-clock" src={iconIosClock0}/> icon.
    * To specify an end time other than now, slide the toggle from **Ending Now** to **Custom Date**.
    * To save your changes and refresh the chart data, select the clock icon again.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Data privacy [#privacy]

New Relic's mobile apps only record information needed to help authenticate and troubleshoot:

* User's email address associated with your New Relic account, including first and last name (for authentication purposes only)
* IP address
