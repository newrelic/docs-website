The New Relic Android app lets you access your data wherever you are. You can view curated dashboards from across New Relic capabilities, from APM to infrastructure to browser, and access any dashboards you've built. If you need to go deeper, you can query your data directly with NRQL or search your logs. And you can receive <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> directly on the app so you can start investigating immediately.
