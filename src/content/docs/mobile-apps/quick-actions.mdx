To keep up in the fast-paced world of engineering and observability, use quick actions to get speedy access to common features of New Relic—right on the home screen.

Quick actions displays up to four of your favorite entities. If you have more than four favorites, you’ll see the most recently used ones. If you haven't set up any favorites, the display shows links to the most-used capabilities (APM, alerts, synthetics, dashboards).

To use this feature, simply long press the New Relic app icon on your home page to see your shortcuts. Here are some examples:
