This explains how to authenticate your New Relic mobile app account, and how to add users to or remove them from your mobile device.

## User authentication

Depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required when you install the New Relic mobile app.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **New Relic account**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Additional requirements**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        New users
      </td>

      <td>
        If you do not already have a New Relic account:

        1. From your desktop web browser, [create a New Relic account](/docs/subscriptions/creating-your-new-relic-account).
        2. [Install your application](/docs/site/installing-the-agent) with the appropriate New Relic agent.

        As part of new account setup, you will receive an email with a password reset link. The password reset link expires after 20 minutes for mobile apps.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Existing New Relic users
      </td>

      <td>
        No additional requirements; your applications, hosts, installed plugins, and key transactions automatically appear after you sign in.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Users with New Relic partner accounts
      </td>

      <td>
        Depending on the partner, you may need to complete a different [authentication process](/docs/ios/ios-with-partners).

        **Azure Store users:** Due to the deep integration between Azure Storefront and New Relic, Azure Storefront users cannot access their accounts on the New Relic Android or iOS apps.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Users with SAML-SSO enabled accounts
      </td>

      <td>
        When you sign in to the New Relic mobile app, your session automatically redirects to your web browser. From there you can sign in to your New Relic SAML-SSO account.

        If you see any errors when using SAML-SSO accounts on your mobile device, verify that you are able to sign in to [https://rpm.newrelic.com](https://rpm.newrelic.com) with a desktop web browser.

        * If no, contact your administrator.
        * If yes, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).
