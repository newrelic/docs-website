The Teams view allows users to visualize Scorecards performance organized by teams. This view aggregates Scorecards data at the team level, making it easier to monitor, compare, and assess how individual teams are meeting organizational engineering standards.

This view is particularly useful for managers and leaders who need a team-centric perspective of Scorecards compliance and performance. It allows you to access the Teams View by clicking on the **Group By** button on the top right corner of the screen. If you are not enrolled in the teams product, please contact your account manager to be enrolled in Teams product public preview.

- **Team grouped score display:**

- Each team’s score is calculated as the average of the Scorecards scores associated with that team, providing an at-a-glance view of each team’s adherence to standards.

- Team status indicators: Each team’s performance status is categorized by color or label such as, <DNT>**Good,**</DNT> <DNT>**Below Goal,**</DNT> <DNT>**Need Attention,**</DNT> to signal areas that require immediate attention.
