title: Scorecards rules
---
To understand scorecards, it is essential to recognize that rules are predefined criteria or conditions used to evaluate performance against specific objectives. These rules form the foundation for assessing whether performance metrics meet the desired standards. 

Each rule typically comprises one or more checks, which are specific queries or tests that determine whether a condition is met, often resulting in a binary outcome (true or false). Rules are aligned with strategic goals, ensuring that the scorecard reflects the organization's priorities. 

By providing structured criteria for evaluation, rules enable consistent and objective performance assessments, offering actionable insights and supporting continuous improvement within the organization.

### Score evaluation

Score evaluation is a systematic process used to assess and quantify performance across various metrics and criteria. Some evaluation parameters are listed below:

- **Check score:**
  A check is a specific query run against an entity to determine if a condition is met. The outcome of a check can only be either true or false. Each check is associated with a single rule and represents the smallest evaluative unit within the rule.

- **Rule score:**
  The Rule Score reflects the performance of all checks associated with that rule. 

- **Scorecard score:**
  The scorecard score represents the average performance across all the rules contained within the scorecard. 

- **Summary score:**
  The overall score represents the average performance across all the scorecards. 


### What is NRQL?
Refer the [NRQL](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) section for more information.

  title="Creating rule NRQL">
    Rules are based on NRQL (New Relic Query Language) queries run against the New Relic Database (NRDB). Each rule spans multiple entities and checks whether each entity meets specific conditions by evaluating to either `true` or `false`. Essentially, a rule verifies whether each entity complies with the defined criteria.

    A rule NRQL must contain the following components:

    1. **Facet by** `entityGuid:` This identifies each entity individually within the query.

    1. **Score Column:** The score column reflects the rule’s result for each entity. It evaluates as: `1:` The entity meets the rule (passes). `0:` The entity does not meet the rule (fails). `-1:` No data is available for the entity (defaults to failure).

Example of a NRQL rule:

The following example checks whether each APM service has alerts configured:

```sql
FROM Entity
SELECT if(latest(alertSeverity) != 'NOT_CONFIGURED', 1, 0) as 'score'
WHERE type = 'APM-APPLICATION'
FACET id as 'entityGuid'
LIMIT MAX
SINCE 1 day ago
```

**Tip:** You can filter entities by specifying attributes, like `type`, within the `Entity` table.

  title="Working with the Entity Event">
    The `Entity` event in NRDB is where you’ll find all attributes related to your entities, allowing you to explore and create rules. For example, to explore the `Entity` event data, run:

```sql

SELECT * FROM Entity LIMIT 10 SINCE 1 day ago

```

### Example use cases for Entity Event

- **Check for alerts configuration:** The example query above checks whether APM services have alerts configured.
- ** Check for tags:** To confirm that entities are tagged (for example, assigned to specific teams), you could use:

```sql

SELECT id as EntityGuid, if(tags.nr.team IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) as 'score'
FROM Entity
SINCE 1 day ago

```

  title="Adding dimensions to your data">

You can add the following dimensions to your rules to make your data more granular:

- Environment
- Team
- Department

To include these dimensions, add them to the `FACET` statement in your NRQL query. Here’s an example:

```sql

SELECT if(latest(alertSeverity) != 'NOT_CONFIGURED', 1, 0) as 'score'
FROM Entity
WHERE type = 'APM-APPLICATION' 
  AND tags.nr.team IS NOT NULL 
  AND tags.environment IS NOT NULL
FACET id as 'entityGuid', tags.nr.team as 'team', tags.environment as 'environment'
LIMIT MAX
SINCE 1 day ago
```
