title: Limitations
---
As Scorecards are in a public preview, the following restrictions apply:

- **Entity limit:** Maximum of 5,000 entities per rule.
- **Rule limit:** Maximum of 1,000 rules per organization.
- **Allowed dimensions:** Only `team`, `department`, and `environment` are allowed.
- **Scorecard association:** If a rule is associated with more than one scorecard, only the last scorecard will consider the rule.
  These limitations ensure system performance and manageability while in limited preview mode.
