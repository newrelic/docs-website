Scorecards page offers a centralized, high-level view of all Scorecards. It provides insights into the organization's adherence to engineering standards and overall performance. This view enables leaders and teams to monitor performance metrics across multiple Scorecards and identify areas requiring immediate action. 

By using this approach, organizations can monitor and improve performance across various predefined areas, ensuring that short-term actions align with long-term objectives. Scorecards transform strategic goals into measurable outcomes, driving continuous improvement and better decision-making.

### Access Scorecards

  Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities >** and click **Scorecards**
    

The above shown dashboard area is dynamic in nature. This dynamic quality is essential for providing real-time insights and enabling users to interact with the data in meaningful ways. This dynamicity serves as the starting point for users to access and manage all scorecards, offering a comprehensive view of engineering performance across the organization.

Use the [filters](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities/#find) to customize the view based on your preferences. You can filter by department, team, scorecard name, or by scorecard status. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of the organization's performance, with the ability to drill down into specific scorecards for detailed insights. You can see this type of capability into [Single Scorecards view](/docs/scorecards/single-scorecard-view/).
