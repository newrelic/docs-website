Rules are the building blocks of Scorecards. Rules contain specific performance conditions for compliance. The rule view enables users to assess and manage individual rules, offering visibility into entities to meet or fail the conditions of each rule.

- <DNT>**Rule description:**</DNT> Each rule includes a description, New Relic Query Language (NRQL) statement, and scope (the entities or accounts it evaluates). Users can examine these rules to understand the purpose and criteria of each rule.

- **Evaluation summary:**

  - <DNT>**Status (Pass/Fail):**</DNT> It shows a list of all the entities evaluated by the rule, showing whether each one passes or fails. This allows users to quickly identify problem areas.

  - **Rule score calculation:** Each ruleâ€™s score is calculated as a percentage of passing checks to total checks, enabling quick assessment of rule adherence.

- **Manage entities:** Users can update the scope of each rule by adding or removing specific entities.

- **Enable/disable rules:** It allows users to toggle rules on or off, based on relevance to current engineering standards.
