What does New Relic do to ensure security, data privacy, and compliance? And what can you do as well?

Here are some resources you can use to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. For example, New Relic has developed processes to comply with privacy laws and regulations so that you can [control how personal information about you and your customers is stored and used](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/new-relic-personal-data-requests).

Across our connected world, information security matters. For more information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our [corporate security policy](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-policy) and our [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security). If you have additional questions, please contact your New Relic account representative.

**Data privacy: What we do.** New Relic follows "privacy by design" principles as part of our overarching security program to [ensure data privacy](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/data-privacy-new-relic) for your accounts, agents, events and attributes, and products and services.

**Data privacy: What you can do.** To customize the types of data you send to New Relic, or to allow specific personnel to view or update the data, you can set [user access levels](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles), assign [API keys](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys), customize [event attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes), adjust your [email settings](/docs/security/new-relic-security/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic#account-communications), etc.

**Security: What we do.** We enforce strong security measures both for the [data we receive and for our employees](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/data-privacy-new-relic#security). If we discover vulnerabilities in our products, we notify you about our corrective actions through [security bulletins](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-bulletins).

**Security: What you can do.** To enhance your own security measures, you can use our [SAML single sign-on (SSO) providers](/docs/accounts/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers), adjust [high security mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode) settings, review [audit logs](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent), and use other [product security options](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/data-privacy-new-relic#product-security).

**Compliance: What we do.** Our [Tier III, SOC2 certified data centers](https://newrelic.com/security) in the US and EU [ensure compliance](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/data-privacy-new-relic#legal) with processing and storing data for specific [retention periods](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components). We are [FedRAMP Authorized Moderate](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/new-relic-security/compliance/data-encryption) for accounts that meet specific criteria.
