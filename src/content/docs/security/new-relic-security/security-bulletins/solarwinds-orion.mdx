We understand that our customers are evaluating the impact of the [SolarWinds Security Advisory](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory) to their business. To address the immediate concern: New Relic is not a customer of the SolarWinds Orion product and therefore New Relic and customers using New Relic are not impacted by the compromised SolarWinds product.
