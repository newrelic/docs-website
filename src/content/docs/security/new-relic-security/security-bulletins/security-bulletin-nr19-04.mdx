## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relic Synthetics private minions create logs automatically to aid in debugging. In earlier minion versions, these logs could contain sensitive data such as secure credentials being used in Synthetics scripts. These logs are stored locally on the minion, but this information is now filtered out.
