## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

Private location images with synthetic monitoring have been updated with patches to protect against the Meltdown CPU vulnerability. Patches to address Spectre have yet to be released by Ubuntu.

Additionally, customers can run in-place upgrades by accessing their private location and running:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

and subsequently rebooting their machine.
