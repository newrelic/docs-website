## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

When configured to obfuscate SQL queries, the .NET agent will pass all queries through an obfuscation function. Due to the way Microsoft SQL Server sanitizes queries, certain character combinations may be generated that could cause this obfuscation to fail.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

This vulnerability only exists when instrumenting Microsoft SQL Server and query obfuscation is enabled.

## Workarounds

* Disable database instrumentation.
* [Update to the latest New Relic .NET agent.](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent)
