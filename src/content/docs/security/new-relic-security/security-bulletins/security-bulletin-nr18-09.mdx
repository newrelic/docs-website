## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

The New Relic Java agent runs explain plans for [slow transaction traces](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-slow-query-details) and slow SQL queries. When a customer has set `record_sql` to `off`, is running PostgreSQL, and has an explain plan run, the agent may not properly obfuscate all information in the query.

## Workarounds

Disable `explain` plans with `transaction_tracer` in the [Java agent configuration](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#h2-Transaction-tracer).
