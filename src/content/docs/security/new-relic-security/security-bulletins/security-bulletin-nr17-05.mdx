## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relicâ€™s Java agent can be configured to obfuscate SQL query information. This setting is forced when [high-security mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode) is enabled. New Relic has found that, when an exception is thrown during the query, full SQL query information may still be captured as part of the error trace when SQL obfuscation is enabled. A fix has been made to disable the collection of this information during error collection. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to the [latest version of the Java agent](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes).

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Only Java agents using SQL obfuscation are affected.

## Workarounds
