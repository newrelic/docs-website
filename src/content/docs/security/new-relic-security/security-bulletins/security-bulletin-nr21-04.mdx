## Action items [#action]

To remediate CVE 2021-44228, CVE 2021-45046, and CVE 2021-45105 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.58 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.17.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.46.

This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to [NR21-03](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-03) for more information.
