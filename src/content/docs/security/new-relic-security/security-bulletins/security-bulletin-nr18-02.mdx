## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

The New Relic Python agent should obfuscate SQL query parameters. This fixes an issue in SQLite transaction tracing. If the query parameters were passed with double quoted strings, the agent was not properly obfuscating these parameters.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Generally, all SQL query parameter strings should be string literals and passed in single quotes. However, the Python SQLite API allows developers to use double quoted strings in some cases.

## Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade the agent, you may be able to take the following actions to ensure you do not send any SQLite query parameters.

* Use single quote string literals with SQLite.
* Disable SQL collection by configuring [transaction_tracer.record_sql](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#txn-tracer-settings) to `off`.
