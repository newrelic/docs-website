## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

The New Relic Node.js agent uses `https-proxy-agent` as an option to send data to the [New Relic collector](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#collector) via an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server. The Node.js agent used a version of this module which was vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure and Denial of Service. This fix updates the module to a version that is not vulnerable.

## Mitigating Circumstances [#workarounds]

Triggering this security vulnerability requires control of the agent proxy authentication configuration.
