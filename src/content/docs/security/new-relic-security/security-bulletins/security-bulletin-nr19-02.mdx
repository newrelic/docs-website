## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

By design, request parameters are added as segment attributes. Request parameters should be ignored when the agent is configured with High-security mode or the `attributes_include` Configurable Security Policy.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

Only affects agents configured with High-security mode or the `attributes_include` Configurable Security Policy.

## Workarounds

* Set `attributed.enabled` to `false` to prevent all attributes from being collected.
* [Update to the latest New Relic Node.js agent.](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-nodejs-agent)
