**Release date:** November 22, 2023

**Vulnerability identifier:** NR23-01

We value our New Relic community and want to make our customers aware of a recent cybersecurity incident that we are working diligently to investigate with the support of third-party cybersecurity experts.

**Customers will be directly contacted if there are any specific actions required of you.** To be clear, if you do not hear from us, there is no action you need to take at this time.

As always, we recommend that you remain vigilant and monitor your account for suspicious activity. Additionally, we encourage you to review [Security Guides](/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/#product-security) for best practices as well as our [Security Bulletins](/docs/security/security-privacy/information-security/security-bulletins/) for updates. 

We will continue to provide relevant updates as we have more information to share.
