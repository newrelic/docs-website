metaDescription: 'Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228, Security Bulletin NR21-03 (Java)'
releaseDate: '2021-12-10'
---

<DNT>**Versions affected:**</DNT> All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1

<DNT>**Fix versions:**</DNT> 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 6.5.4, 7.4.2, 7.4.3 and 7.5.0

<DNT>**Vulnerability identifier:**</DNT> NR21-03

We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. Nonetheless, newer versions of the New Relic Java agent will use the latest Apache versions of log4j (currently versions 2.17.1 (Java 8) and 2.12.4 (Java 7), which patches CVE-2021-44832).

We have also determined that New Relic's Java agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to _at least_ the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228.

As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent.

## Summary

New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available.

## Action items [#action]

To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible.

If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging.
</Callout>

### How to disable the Java agent logging [#disable]

You can set your Java agent logging level to `OFF` to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options:

* Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the `log_level` parameter) (no restart is required)
* Define the `newrelic.config.log_level=OFF` system property (restart required)
* Set the `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF` environment variable  (restart required)

You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written.

Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability.

<DNT>**Note:**</DNT> This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version.

We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes.

<DNT>
  **If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). This page provides remediation details for you to consider.**
</DNT>

### Containerized private minions [#CPM]

The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion. Please refer to [NR21-04](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-04/) for more information.

## Frequently asked questions [#faq]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="upgrade-options"
    title="What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java?"
  >
    Please implement the [recommended workaround in this bulletin](#action).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="versions"
    title="How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running?"
  >
    Agent version information is displayed within the <DNT>**Environment**</DNT> page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our [docs page](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/get-environment-data-about-your-apm-app) for more information.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="patch-v5"
    title="Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below?"
  >
    Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="update-742"
    title="I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again?"
  >
    If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability.  While we have released a newer Java agent with log4j 2.17.1 (Java 8) and 2.12.4 (Java 7), we have determined that updating to 6.5.3+ or 7.4.3+ is not critical as New Relic's Java agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.
