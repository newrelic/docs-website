## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

When manually constructing SQL queries that execute stored procedures with parameters, a missing space before the first value may cause the agent to incorrectly identify the metric name. This may result in sensitive data being included in metric names.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

This vulnerability only affects applications that manually assemble SQL queries with parameters, without using parameterized queries. It’s recommended that applications use parameterized queries to help avoid introducing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Workarounds

* Utilize parameterized queries, this also helps to prevent [SQL injection vulnerabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-injection).
* [Update to the latest New Relic .NET agent.](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent)
