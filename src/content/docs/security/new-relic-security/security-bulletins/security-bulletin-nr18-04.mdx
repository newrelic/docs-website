## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relic’s .NET error collection captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. If High Security Mode is enabled, the agent should not capture details of the error messages. This release fixes the agent for error traces and error events so that the error message is not sent to New Relic when High Security Mode is enabled.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* This is a special feature of [High Security Mode](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#high_security_mode).

## Workarounds

Disable [error collection](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#error_collector) in the agent configuration or [ignore specific exceptions](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#error-ignoreErrors) in the configuration.
