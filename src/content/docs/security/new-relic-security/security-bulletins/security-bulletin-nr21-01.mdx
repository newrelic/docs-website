## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

Browsers can render local files on a host machine by using the `file://` URI scheme outlined in RFC 8089. During the agent's harvest cycle , this `file://` URI will be recorded as the pageURL datapoint. This may result in the collection of potentially sensitive data included in the local file path, such as directory path for the saved webpage and any name or company information in the directory path. More information regarding the `file://` URI can be found in the [RFC 8089](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8089)

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

A person must both download a webpage with the browser agent configured and open the file in a browser. HTML files loaded without the `file://` URI scheme are not affected.
