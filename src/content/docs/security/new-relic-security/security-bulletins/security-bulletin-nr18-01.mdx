## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

An internal audit of the [Python High-security mode](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#high_security) revealed that the agent could send additional data to New Relic by customizing message params with the tracing APIs. Custom parameters may be sent to New Relic if a developer is passing additional parameters using either the function trace API or the message trace API. These should be disabled when High-security mode is enabled.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* This only affects customers that have enabled High-security mode with the Python agent and a developer is adding additional information to the tracing API.

## Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade the agent, you may be able to take the following action to ensure you do not send any additional data in High-security mode.

* Remove any custom params to the [function trace API](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/function_trace) or the [message trace API](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/message-trace).
