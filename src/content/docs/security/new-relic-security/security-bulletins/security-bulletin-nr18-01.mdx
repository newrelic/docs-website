## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

An internal audit of the [Python High Security Mode](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#high_security) revealed that the agent could send additional data to New Relic by customizing message params with the tracing APIs. Custom parameters may be sent to New Relic if a developer is passing additional parameters using either the function trace API or the message trace API. These should be disabled when High Security Mode is enabled.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* This only affects customers that have enabled High Security Mode with the Python agent and a developer is adding additional information to the tracing API.

## Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade the agent, you may be able to take the following action to ensure you do not send any additional data in High Security Mode.

* Remove any custom params to the [function trace API](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/function_trace) or the [message trace API](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/message-trace).
