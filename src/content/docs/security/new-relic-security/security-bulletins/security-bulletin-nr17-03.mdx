## Summary

A security update for New Relic's Ruby agent fixes a vulnerability where the agent could unintentionally capture raw aggregate queries with MongoDB. New Relic recommends updating to the latest remediated version.

**Release date:** February 9, 2017

**Vulnerability identifier:** NR17-03

**Priority:** Low

## Affected software [#affected]

The following New Relic agent versions are affected:

      <td>
        3.13.1 (and greater)
      </td>

      <td>
        With MongoDB driver 2.1 (and greater)
      </td>

      <td>
        [3.18.1](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/ruby-agent-3181330)
      </td>

## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relicâ€™s Ruby Agent version 3.13.1 added visibility to MongoDB queries with version 2.1 and greater of the MongoDB driver for Ruby. The agent's default setting for **mongo.obfuscate_queries** is true. This should cause the agent to obfuscate the values in Mongo queries before sending this information to New Relic. However, when using the aggregate pipeline with this version of the driver, the aggregate queries were not properly obfuscated.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Only customers who use version 2.1 and greater of the Ruby Driver for MongoDB are affected
* Aggregate queries generally do not contain sensitive information

## Workarounds

Users who are affected and are unable to upgrade may choose to configure the Ruby agent to not capture mongoDB queries. Users can set **mongo.capture_queries** to false to prevent the agent from sending any information about the query.
