## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

In order to generate explain plans, a copy of the SQL query is created and the query is reissued with a request for the execution plan. If the explain plan fails, the agent may log the full SQL statement which could include the parameter values.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

The agent will only log this information when set to the `DEBUG` or `FINEST` logging levels.

## Workarounds

* Ensure that logging level is not set to `DEBUG` or `FINEST`.
* Disable capturing of explain plans.
* Ensure that file location of log files is secured.
* [Update to the latest New Relic .NET agent.](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent)
