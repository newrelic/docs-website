## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relic’s .NET Agent version **6.8.172.0** added visibility into Error Analytics. By default the agent will capture error events, and with WCF applications this is captured as event type **TransactionError**. New Relic has found that the **service.request.\*** attributes may contain sensitive information that should not be sent to New Relic. A fix has been made to disable the collection of these parameters during the error collection. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the .NET agent.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Only .NET agents with Error Analytics and WCF applications are affected.
* All service request attributes are disabled in High Security Mode.

## Workarounds

Users who are affected and unable to upgrade may choose to manually configure the .NET agent to not capture service request parameters. Users can exclude **service.request.\*** attributes from the **errorCollector** stanza in their newrelic.config file.

```
<attributes enabled="true">
     <exclude > service.request.*</exclude>
 </attributes>
```
