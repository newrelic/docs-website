## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relic’s Infrastructure agent collects information about running processes, including process command lines. The default configuration setting `strip_command_line: true` should prevent additional command line parameters from being sent to New Relic. With some command line options, the agent will capture the additional command line parameters even with that setting enabled.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Generally, sensitive data will not be part of the command line options.
* On Linux systems, the command line parameters will only be collected if the command line arguments (flags) have paths with a path separator element (`/`).
* On Windows systems, the command line parameters will only be collected if the command line has switches starting with `/` or `-` and contain path separator elements (`\`).

## Workarounds

The only solution for this issue is to [update the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
