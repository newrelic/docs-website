## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

New Relic’s .NET agent captures a transaction trace to get detailed information about a single transaction including function calls, database calls, and external calls. By default, the agent should not collect the details of external calls (HTTP requests). Previous versions of the agent will collect the external http request parameters which may contain sensitive information. This release fixes the default behavior of the .NET agent to not collect the request parameters of external HTTP requests.

### Mitigating factors [#factors]

* Query parameters used in external HTTP requests made using [HttpClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.httpclient.aspx), [WebRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest.aspx), or other library that uses these calls.
* Transaction Trace enabled (default setting)

## Workarounds

Disable [transaction trace](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#transaction_tracer) in the .NET agent configuration.
