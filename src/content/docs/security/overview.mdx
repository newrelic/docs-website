    What does New Relic do to ensure security, data privacy, and compliance? And what can you do as well?

    Here are some resources you can use to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. For example, New Relic has developed processes to comply with privacy laws and regulations so that you can [control how personal information about you and your customers is stored and used](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/new-relic-personal-data-requests).

    Across our connected world, information security matters. For more information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our [corporate security policy](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-policy) and our [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security). If you have additional questions, please contact your New Relic account representative.
