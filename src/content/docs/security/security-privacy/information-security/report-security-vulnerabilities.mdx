New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. We believe that engaging with security researchers through our coordinated disclosure program is an important measure to achieve our security goals.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, we welcome and thank you for reporting it through our coordinated disclosure program, as explained in this document. If you have other concerns, see the information about [other email or account issues](#customer-issues).

## Coordinated disclosure program [#coordinated_disclosure_program]

New Relic partners with established bug bounty platforms to make it as easy as possible for researchers to report security vulnerabilities to us. In recognition of the effort involved in finding these issues, we may provide bounties for eligible reports. 

After many years, New Relic is transitioning our coordinated disclosure program to Bugcrowd in March 2024. 
* Reports to the HackerOne program will pause on March 11, 2024 and close fully on March 29, 2024. 
* The new Bugcrowd program will open initially as a private program.

To participate in the coordinated disclosure program:

1. Ensure that you're familiar with [our policies with HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/newrelic) before initiating any security testing.
2. Only test against accounts you control.

## Customer security issues [#customer-issues]

If you are a New Relic customer and have a password or account issue, do not use our coordinated disclosure program. Instead, please follow our standard troubleshooting procedures for [password, email, and login problems](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems).
