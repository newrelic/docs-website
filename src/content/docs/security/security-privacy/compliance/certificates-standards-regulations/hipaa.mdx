The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for personal health information held by covered entities, and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information. Find HIPAA account enablement information at the [HIPAA readiness page](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic/).

To use New Relic in compliance with US HIPAA contact your account representative regarding a Business Associate Addendum (BAA).
