Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), maintained by Security Standards Council, is a set of security requirements to protect cardholder data environments (CDEs) where payment card data is stored, processed, or transmitted. PCI DSS provides a baseline of rigorous technical and operational requirements designed to protect CDEs.

Assessed against the PCI DSS version 4.0, New Relic maintains a Report on Compliance (ROC) and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) as a [Level 1 Service Provider](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/glossary/service-provider/).

New Relic removes some of your sensitive data in logs with automatic [log obfuscation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy/#auto-obfuscation). Enabled by default for all customers.
