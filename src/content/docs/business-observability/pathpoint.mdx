Pathpoint is an enterprise platform tracker that offers a unique approach to business journey observability by modeling system health in relation to actual user-impacting the different business stages. 

By monitoring and analyzing the health and performance of all components of the customer journey, including all internal processes and external dependencies, Pathpoint allows organizations to easily identify and resolve issues that impact the customer journey, optimize internal processes, and improve the overall customer experience. 

## Pathpoint components

Pathpoint is business journey observability and maps an organization's customer journey, from the initial interaction with the organization through to the completion of the transaction. 

Each pathpoint is divided into:


<CollapserGroup>

<Collapser id="pathpoint-stages" title="Stages"> 

These are the highest level business stages. At the actual system level these will be a rollup of many services and methods and show the complete health, congestion, count and Infrastructure state of a Pathpoint.

    />

The different stages of a Pathpoint enables you to gain a high-level overview of business processes and identify the different services and methods presented at the system level for each commercial stage.

### Types of Stages 
    
The stages are defined as either a Person or a Process stage. 

    <img
        title="Types of stages"
        alt="types of stages"
        src={stagesTypes}
    />

In the image above, you can see the symbols for the two types of stages:
- The one to count Processes  
- The one to count People

Each Pathpoint stage is defined to either count people or proceses, by the touchpoints under the steps it has. If a step, under a stage, has touchpoints of the PCC (Process count), then the stage will show the Process count symbol. Likewise, if a step, under a stage, has touchpoints of the PRC (People count) under it, then the stage will show the People count symbol.

<Callout variant="important">

    Please note that under a single stage, you should only count either persons (PRC Touchpoint) or processes (PCC Touchpoint).

### Get real-time information for each stage:

You can view real-time information related to a particular stage including any errors associated with it. You can see if any of the associated touchpoints for a particular stage are critical, in which case the stage will turn yellow. If everything is working normally, the stage will stay green. If all touchpoints have anomalies that need to be resolved, the stage will turn red.
    
In addition to these indicators, Pathpoint also provides color-coded representation for congestion on the stage. If the stage turns blue, it indicates congestion, as shown in the example above. If the stage is free of congestion, the color of the stage will be white. These visual cues help you quickly identify issues and take action to resolve them.

<Collapser id="pathpoint-steps" title="Steps"> 

Steps are “sub-stages” of a parent stage and represent the various events occurring throughout the stage.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint steps"
        alt="Pathpoint steps"
        src={steps}
    />

The steps can be placed in the traditional sequential manner of step 1,2,3.., but also in a parallel form to represent optional and simultaneous actions and activities.

Touchpoints are the more granular entities of the PathPoint model. They are often a specific APM or Browser application, but you can use any NRQL query as a touchpoint as well.

Each touchpoint holds its own health, status, performance metrics, count, and business knowledge related to a specific data object, environment, application, device, API, or service and they can also be customized to fit a specific journey's goal.

        src={touchpoints}
    />

### Touchpoint status

Touchpoints have three different health status, which are color-coded for easy identification.
- Green: The Touchpoint is healthy, and everything is working as expected.
- Gray: The Touchpoint requires attention, and there might be some issues that need to be addressed.
- Red: The Touchpoint is in a fail state, and there are critical issues that require immediate attention.

Every step of a Pathpoint is connected to one or more touchpoints. As such, the health status of every step is dependent on the status of its respective touchpoints. Therefore, touchpoints are considered the pulse of each Pathpoint. By monitoring the status of touchpoints, you can gain insights into the health of the entire system and identify any anomalies that need attention.

<Callout variant="tip">

    By default, you will only see the unhealthy touchpoints. To view all touchpoints associated with a Pathpoint, you can click **view all**.

        title="View all touchpoints"
        alt="View all touchpoints"
        src={viewAllTouchpoints}
    />

</Callout>

### View touchpoint query
  
Queries allow you to determine all the parameters that of a particular touchpoint should consider. They are pre-programmed on a file called _JSON configuration file_, and you can also manually tweak them to fit a specific journey’s goal.
  
To view a particular touchpoint query: 
- Right click on the particular Touchpoint you want to work with.
- Click on **Queries**.

    <img
        title="View query of a touchpoint"
        alt="View query of a touchpoint"
        src={viewQuery}
    />
The image above shows the query associated with **Login People (PRC)** touchpoint.

By tracking each of these components, Pathpoint provides a comprehensive view of how customers interact with an organization at every stage of their journey. This makes it possible to identify and diagnose issues quickly, optimize the customer experience, and make data-driven decisions to drive better business outcomes.
