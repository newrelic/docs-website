<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration for Cloud Cost Intelligence enables you to monitor and analyze your GCP cloud spending directly within New Relic. This integration uses a service account-based authorization method to securely access your GCP billing and pricing data.

When you set up this integration, New Relic creates a dedicated service account in its GCP environment on your behalf. You grant this service account read-only access to your BigQuery datasets, allowing New Relic to retrieve and analyze your cost data without requiring broader access to your GCP resources.

## Key features
  - Automated service account generation per New Relic account
  - Secure, read-only access to billing data via BigQuery
  - Access to both billing export and cloud pricing export tables
  - Connection validation and error reporting

## Prerequisites

  Before setting up the GCP integration, ensure you have:
  - Connection to New Relic infrastructure monitoring - A GCP project already connected. See [Connect Google Cloud Platform services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-new-relic/)
  - Enabled billing on an active GCP account.
  - Configured a BigQuery dataset with these tables:
      - Billing Export table (contains your GCP billing data)
      - Cloud Pricing Export table (contains GCP pricing information)
  - Verified access to Google Cloud Console.
