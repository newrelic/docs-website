  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).

## Overview

Connect your Google Cloud Platform billing to Cloud Cost Intelligence for complete cost monitoring and optimization. The integration uses service account-based authorization to securely access your GCP billing and pricing data. New Relic creates a dedicated service account and you grant it read-only access to your BigQuery datasets, without requiring broader access to your GCP resources.

## Before you begin

  - **Active GCP billing account**
  - **BigQuery dataset** with:
      - Billing Export table
      - Cloud Pricing Export table
  - **Google Cloud Console access**
