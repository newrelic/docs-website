</Callout>

## Access integrations

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Navigate to Cloud Cost Intelligence

    Go to <DNT>[**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > select <DNT>**All Capabilities**</DNT> > <DNT>**Cloud Cost Intelligence**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Open the Integrations tab

    Select the **Integrations** tab to view all cloud cost integrations.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a new integration

    Select the **+ Add new integrations** to add a new integration for a cloud provider account.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Review integration status

    Check the **Status** column to assess integration health across your cloud providers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understand integration status

Each integration displays one of the following status indicators:

* <DNT>**In Progress**</DNT>: Connection setup is underway; initial configuration and authentication are being established.
* <DNT>**Validated**</DNT>: Connection has been successfully authenticated and all prerequisite checks have passed; awaiting first cost file publication in the storage account.
* <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT>: Integration is fully operational and actively collecting cost data.
* <DNT>**Failed**</DNT>: Connection encountered an error and requires attention. Click the connection name to view error details and resolution steps.
* <DNT>**Paused**</DNT>: Data collection has been temporarily suspended. You can pause a connection after it reaches <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT> status and unpause it later.

<Callout variant="tip">
Monitor the <DNT>**Status**</DNT> column regularly to ensure integrations remain <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT>. Address failed integrations promptly to avoid gaps in cost data collection, and review validation requirements during the <DNT>**In Progress**</DNT> phase to expedite activation.
</Callout>

## Manage integrations

Click the ellipsis icon next to an integration to access available actions. The actions displayed depend on the current integration status:

* <DNT>**Retry**</DNT>: Available for <DNT>**Failed**</DNT> integrations; reattempts the connection setup process.
* <DNT>**Pause**</DNT>: Available for <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT> integrations; temporarily suspends data collection while preserving configuration.
* <DNT>**Activate**</DNT>: Available for <DNT>**Paused**</DNT> integrations; resumes data collection.
* <DNT>**Delete**</DNT>: Available for <DNT>**Failed**</DNT> integrations (prior to activation); permanently removes the integration and allows for fresh connection setup.

<Callout variant="tip">
Use <DNT>**Pause**</DNT> rather than <DNT>**Delete**</DNT> for temporary suspensions to preserve your integration configuration.
