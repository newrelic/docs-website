<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Monitor integration health and manage cloud provider connections across AWS, Azure, and GCP with status-based actions.

<Callout variant="important">
The Integrations tab becomes accessible after you successfully complete at least one cloud provider integration.
</Callout>

## Access integrations

1. Go to <DNT>[**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > select <DNT>**All Capabilities**</DNT> > <DNT>**Cloud Cost Intelligence**</DNT>.
2. Select the **Integrations** tab to view all cloud cost integrations.
3. Select the **+ Add new integrations** to add a new integration for a cloud provider account.
4. Check the **Status** column to assess integration health across your cloud providers.

## Understand integration status

Each integration displays one of the following status indicators:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Status
      </th>
      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**In Progress**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        Connection setup is underway; initial configuration and authentication are being established.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Validated**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        Connection has been successfully authenticated and all prerequisite checks have passed; awaiting first cost file publication in the storage account.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        Integration is fully operational and actively collecting cost data.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Failed**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        Connection encountered an error and requires attention. Click the connection name to view error details and resolution steps.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Paused**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        Data collection has been temporarily suspended. You can pause a connection after it reaches <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT> status and unpause it later.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="tip">
Monitor the <DNT>**Status**</DNT> column regularly to ensure integrations remain <DNT>**RUNNING**</DNT>. Address failed integrations promptly to avoid gaps in cost data collection, and review validation requirements during the <DNT>**In Progress**</DNT> phase to expedite activation.
</Callout>

## Manage integrations

Click the ellipsis icon next to an integration to access available actions. The actions displayed depend on the current integration status:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "120px" }}>
        Action
      </th>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Available for
      </th>
      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Retry**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Failed**</DNT> integrations
      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      </td>
      <td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Activate**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Paused**</DNT> integrations
      </td>
      <td>
        Resumes data collection.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Delete**</DNT>
      </td>
      <td>
        <DNT>**Failed**</DNT> integrations (prior to activation)
      </td>
      <td>
        Permanently removes the integration and allows for fresh connection setup.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="tip">
Use <DNT>**Pause**</DNT> rather than <DNT>**Delete**</DNT> for temporary suspensions to preserve your integration configuration.
