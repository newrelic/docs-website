<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence supports custom tagging alongside default tags in Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) for resource cost allocation. Filter and group tags for detailed expense analysis. In Kubernetes environments, apply labels to clusters and resources. Tag selection dropdowns are sourced from CUR data and `K8SContainerSample` Event.

## Configure settings

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Navigate to general settings

    Go to <DNT>[**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) > **All Capabilities** > **Cloud Cost Intelligence**</DNT> > **General** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure tags

    Select resource tags and Kubernetes labels from cost & usage files:

    1. From **Choose Resource tags for cost allocation** list, select resource tags to categorize cloud costs across services.
    2. From **Choose Kubernetes tags for cost mapping** list, select Kubernetes labels to categorize costs.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Manage telemetry data access

    1. Select **Telemetry Data** tab.
    2. From **Select accounts for telemetry data** list, choose accounts for telemetry data.

      <Callout variant="important">
      Real-time cost estimation and K8s Allocation are supported through telemetry data. Reuses existing telemetry pipeline for utilization metrics. No new data ingested except CUR file ingest.
