  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Compute Intelligence supports custom tagging alongside default tags, integrated into Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) for resource cost allocation. This allows you to filter and group tags for detailed expense analysis. In Kubernetes environments, tags can be applied to clusters and resources. Dropdowns for tag selection are sourced from CUR data and K8SContainerSample Event, streamlining management and analysis.
