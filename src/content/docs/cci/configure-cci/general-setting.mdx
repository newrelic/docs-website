<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence supports custom tagging alongside default tags, integrated into Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) for resource cost allocation. This allows you to filter and group tags for detailed expense analysis. In Kubernetes environments, labels can be applied to clusters and resources. Dropdowns for tag selection are sourced from CUR data and `K8SContainerSample` Event, streamlining management and analysis.

## Configure General settings

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ## Navigate to General settings
      1. Navigate to <DNT>[**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) > **All Capabilities** > **Cloud Cost Intelligence**</DNT>.
      2. From the left-hand navigation menu, select the **General** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure tags

    Select the desired resources tags and Kubernetes labels from values sourced through the cost & usage files for streamlining management and analysis

    1. To categorize and break down cloud costs across services, from the **Choose Resource tags for cost allocation**  list, select the resource tags.
    2. To categorize and break down cloud costs across services, from the **Choose Kubernetes tags for cost mapping** list, select the Kubernetes labels.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Manage telemetry data access

    1. To request information about the accounts from which you want to pull telemetry data for cost analysis, select the **Telemetry Data** tab.
    2. To view and manage telemetry data for your cost analysis, from the **Select accounts for telemetry data** list, choose one or more accounts.

      <Callout variant="important">
        - Real time cost estimation is supported through telemetry data.
        - K8s Allocation is supported through telemetry data.
        - We reuse existing telemetry pipeline to get utilisation metrics, and no new data is ingested except the CUR file ingest.
