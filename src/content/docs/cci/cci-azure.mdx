            </td>
            <td>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      After entering all the required information, click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ### Grant New Relic access to your billing data

      Now that you've provided your Azure connection details, New Relic needs permission to read the billing data from your storage container. This step authorizes the New Relic service principal (**msazurecostdata**) to access your billing exports securely.

      <Callout variant="tip">
        Azure administrator approval is required for this step.
      </Callout>

      - **Initiate the connection request**

        1. Click the **Initiate Connection** button in the New Relic interface.
        2. You'll be redirected to the Microsoft Authentication flow.
        3. Review and accept the authentication request.
        4. A small file (0 KB) will download to your system upon acceptance. You can safely delete this file.

      - **Verify the service principal was added**

        After accepting the authentication request, confirm that the New Relic service principal was successfully added to your Azure environment:

        1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** in your Microsoft Entra Account.
        2. Verify that the service principal **msazurecostdata** appears in the list.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          For help viewing enterprise applications, see the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/view-applications-portal).
        </Callout>

      - **Assign read permissions to the service principal**

        The final step grants the service principal permission to read your billing data. You'll assign the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role, which provides read-only access to the billing exports.

        **Prerequisites for this step**:
        - Access to the storage account where the billing export is published
        - Permissions to modify IAM role assignments

        **Follow these steps**:

        1. **Navigate to Access Control**:
          - Open the storage account container where your billing exports are published.
          - Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation menu.

        2. **Add role assignment**:
          - Navigate to the **Role Assignments** tab.
          - Click **Add** or **Add role assignment**.

        3. **Select the role**:
          - Choose **Storage Blob Data Reader** from the role list.

        4. **Assign the service principal**:
          - In the **Add Members** section, search for **msazurecostdata** (the service principal you verified in the previous step).
          - Select it from the search results.

        5. **Complete the assignment**:
          - Review the role assignment configuration.
          - Click **Review + Assign** to finalize.
          - Verify that **msazurecostdata** now appears in the role assignments list.

      - **Verify the connection**

        After completing all the steps above, confirm that:
        - Service principal **msazurecostdata** is visible in Enterprise Applications
        - Service principal has the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role assigned
        - Role assignment is applied to the correct storage account container
        - Connection test completes successfully in the New Relic interface

        <Callout variant="tip">
          **Security note**: The service principal only has read-only access to your billing data. It cannot write, modify, or delete any data. Access is limited exclusively to the billing export container you specified.
        </Callout>

        With permissions configured, New Relic can now begin collecting your Azure cost data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
     ### Verify data collection

      You've successfully connected your Azure billing to Cloud Cost Intelligence! Your Azure cost data will begin flowing into New Relic.

      **What happens next**:
      - New Relic will start processing your Azure billing exports
      - Initial data processing can take up to 12 hours
      - Once processing completes, you'll see your cost data in the Cost Overview dashboard

      <Callout variant="important">
        Processing your data for the first time can take up to 12 hours.
      </Callout>

      **View your data**:
