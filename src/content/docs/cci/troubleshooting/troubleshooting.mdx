When setting up Cloud Cost Intelligence, you might encounter some issues. Here're some common problems, possible reasons, and suggested troubleshooting steps to help you resolve them effectively:

## Data not showing up in New Relic
If you're not seeing the Cost Usage Report (CUR), real-time cost estimation, or Kubernetes cost allocation data in your New Relic account, here're some steps to troubleshoot the issue:
- **Reason:** There might be gaps in completing the prerequisites.
- **Solution:** 
  1. Double-check that you've completed all the required prerequisites.
  2. Verify your setup configuration.
  3. If the problem still persists, reach out to [the Cloud Cost Intelligence support](mailto:cci-support@newrelic.com).

## Connection drop

- **Reason:** An unstable network connection could cause the setup to drop.
- **Solution:** Ensure a stable internet connection and attempt the setup again. If the issue persists, check with your network administrator for potential firewall restrictions.

## Inadequate user privileges

- **Reason:** The user does not have the necessary permissions to set up Cloud Cost Intelligence.
- **Solution:** Review your AWS and New Relic account permissions. Ensure you have adequate privileges to perform the setup. Contact your administrator if needed.

## ARN configuration error

- **Message:** "The ARN you entered does not permit the correct access to your AWS account - please check the ARN and try again."
- **Reason:** Incorrect ARN configuration that does not allow access.
- **Solution:** Double-check the ARN you've entered and ensure it matches the configuration required for access. Correct any errors and retry the setup.

## Security risk with external ID

- **Message:** "Security risk: The ARN you entered has broad permissions. Any 'external id' can be used to assume role. Please add the provided external ID '%s' as externalId while creating the AWS Role."
- **Reason:** An overly permissive external ID policy poses a security risk.
- **Solution:** Update your AWS role settings to ensure that the provided external ID is used as externalId.

## Bucket doesn't exist

- **Reason:** The specified AWS S3 bucket does not exist.
- **Solution:** Verify the bucket name matches the one in your AWS account. The name must also have the prefix, `cost-and-usage-reports`. Create the bucket if it does not exist, or correct the name in the setup.

## Bucket name error

- **Reason:** The specified AWS S3 bucket does not exist or there is a typo in the bucket name.
- **Solution:** Verify that the bucket name matches the one in your AWS account and includes the prefix `cost-and-usage-reports`. Ensure the name is spelled correctly. If the bucket does not exist, create it, or correct the name in the setup.

## Duplicate connection name

- **Message:** "%s Cloud Cost Intelligence AWS connection name already exists. Please enter a new connection name."
- **Reason:** The connection name you've entered is already in use.
- **Solution:** Choose a unique connection name and try again.

## Duplicate payer account configuration

- **Message:** "%s AWS Payer account is already linked in this New Relic account."
- **Reason:** Attempting to configure the same AWS payer account more than once.
- **Solution:** Verify that the AWS payer account isn't already linked. Use a different payer account if necessary.
