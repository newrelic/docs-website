</Callout>

If you encounter issues during setup, find solutions below:

## Data missing from reports

If you're not seeing Cost Usage Report (CUR), real-time cost estimation, or Kubernetes cost allocation data:
- **Reason:** Incomplete prerequisites
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify all setup prerequisites are completed
  2. Check setup configuration
  3. Contact Cloud Cost Intelligence support at cci-support@newrelic.com if issue persists

## Connection fails during setup

- **Reason:** Unstable network connection
- **Solution:** Ensure stable internet connection and retry setup. Check with network administrator for firewall restrictions if issue persists.

## Insufficient permissions

- **Reason:** User lacks necessary permissions
- **Solution:** Verify you have administrator permissions or required IAM policies in AWS and New Relic. Contact administrator if needed.

## ARN configuration error

- **Message:** "The ARN you entered does not permit the correct access to your AWS account - please check the ARN and try again."
- **Reason:** Incorrect ARN configuration
- **Solution:** Verify ARN matches required configuration. Correct errors and retry setup.

## Security risk with external ID

- **Message:** "Security risk: The ARN you entered has broad permissions. Any 'external id' can be used to assume role. Please add the provided external ID '%s' as externalId while creating the AWS Role."
- **Reason:** Overly permissive external ID policy
- **Solution:** Update AWS role settings to use provided external ID as externalId.

## S3 bucket not found

- **Reason:** S3 bucket doesn't exist or incorrect bucket name
- **Solution:** Verify bucket name matches your AWS account. Ensure the S3 path prefix is `cost-and-usage-reports`. Check spelling, create bucket if needed, or correct the name.

## Duplicate connection name

- **Message:** "%s Cloud Cost Intelligence AWS connection name already exists. Please enter a new connection name."
- **Reason:** Connection name already in use
- **Solution:** Choose unique connection name and retry.

## Duplicate payer account configuration

- **Message:** "%s AWS Payer account is already linked in this New Relic account."
- **Reason:** AWS payer account already configured
- **Solution:** Verify payer account isn't already linked. Use different payer account if necessary.

## CloudFormation setup

If the **Create CFT Stack** fails:

1. Check for the Status row in the Events tab/column of the selected stack.
2. Look for **CREATE_FAILED** and share the Status reason message with New Relic.
3. Go to **CloudWatch** and under **CloudWatch logs**, select your cloud formation stack name and click **View in Logs console**.
4. Under **Log Streams**, open the log and share the log with New Relic support.

## Failed Integrations

When an integration displays a Failed status:

1. Click the account name under the **Name** column to view detailed information
2. Review the error message and recommended resolution steps displayed on the details page
3. Follow the general troubleshooting guidance provided
4. Use the **Retry** action after addressing the identified issues
5. If the issue persists after following resolution steps, contact Cloud Cost Intelligence support at cci-support@newrelic.com
