Common problems and troubleshooting steps for Cloud Cost Intelligence setup:

## Data not showing up
If you're not seeing Cost Usage Report (CUR), real-time cost estimation, or Kubernetes cost allocation data:
- **Reason:** Incomplete prerequisites
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify all prerequisites are completed
  2. Check setup configuration
  3. Contact [Cloud Cost Intelligence support](mailto:cci-support@newrelic.com) if issue persists

## Connection drop

- **Reason:** Unstable network connection
- **Solution:** Ensure stable internet connection and retry setup. Check with network administrator for firewall restrictions if issue persists.

## Inadequate user privileges

- **Reason:** User lacks necessary permissions
- **Solution:** Review AWS and New Relic account permissions. Ensure adequate privileges for setup. Contact administrator if needed.

## ARN configuration error

- **Message:** "The ARN you entered does not permit the correct access to your AWS account - please check the ARN and try again."
- **Reason:** Incorrect ARN configuration
- **Solution:** Verify ARN matches required configuration. Correct errors and retry setup.

## Security risk with external ID

- **Message:** "Security risk: The ARN you entered has broad permissions. Any 'external id' can be used to assume role. Please add the provided external ID '%s' as externalId while creating the AWS Role."
- **Reason:** Overly permissive external ID policy
- **Solution:** Update AWS role settings to use provided external ID as externalId.

## Bucket doesn't exist

- **Reason:** Specified S3 bucket does not exist
- **Solution:** Verify bucket name matches your AWS account. Name must include prefix `cost-and-usage-reports`. Create bucket if needed or correct name.

## Bucket name error

- **Reason:** S3 bucket doesn't exist or typo in bucket name
- **Solution:** Verify bucket name matches AWS account and includes prefix `cost-and-usage-reports`. Check spelling. Create bucket or correct name.

## Duplicate connection name

- **Message:** "%s Cloud Cost Intelligence AWS connection name already exists. Please enter a new connection name."
- **Reason:** Connection name already in use
- **Solution:** Choose unique connection name and retry.

## Duplicate payer account configuration

- **Message:** "%s AWS Payer account is already linked in this New Relic account."
- **Reason:** AWS payer account already configured
- **Solution:** Verify payer account isn't already linked. Use different payer account if necessary.
