<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Cloud Cost Intelligence is designed to provide visibility and management of cloud costs. Cloud Cost Intelligence aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures.

For example, as your large enterprise rapidly scales its use of cloud services, tracking and managing cloud expenses can become increasingly complex. Cloud Cost Intelligence assists by providing insights into where your money is being allocated. This can help you identify areas for potential cost savings. By aligning cloud expenditures with actual usage, you can optimize your budgets while continuing to support strategic growth initiatives. This approach helps ensure that every dollar you invest is contributing to your company's overall success.

## Features

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Comprehensive cost visibility
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by application, service, owning team, and region.
- **Trend analysis:** Gain insights into month-over-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers.
=======
### Intelligent summary

The [Intelligent summary](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights) page is your primary landing page, showing all cloud spending in one place. View how costs move through your organization, broken down by services, teams, and regions.

Key features:
- **Consolidated view:** All cloud spending in one place
- **Sankey chart:** Navigate and drill down into cost details
- **Cost segregation:** View costs by services, teams, and regions
- **Dynamic views:** Change views (e.g., accounts view)
- **Category breakdown:** Segment costs by application, service, team, and region
- **Trend analysis:** Track cost trends, averages, and top cost drivers

### Cost Overview

The [Cost Overview](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cost-overview) page provides detailed cost analysis with drill-down functionality from service level to individual resources.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Kubernetes cost allocation

View Kubernetes costs broken down by application name using New Relic telemetry data.

### Real-time cost estimation

Get hourly cost updates within an hour of resource provisioning. Cost estimates use the average unit price from the past week and New Relic telemetry data from the recent 48 hours. Without this integration, estimates use standard unit pricing rates.

#### Accuracy requirements

For accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. Without this data, estimates revert to on-demand pricing.

## Data collection and processing

### Cross-account data collection

<Callout variant="important">
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**Cross-account data collection**<br/>
Cloud Cost Intelligence is scoped to the user and collects telemetry data from all accounts associated with your New Relic user credentials. This means that even if you're using a single New Relic account for Cloud Cost Intelligence, telemetry data from any additional New Relic accounts you have access to will also be collected and visible within that single New Relic account. Verify that your user account permissions are in line with your internal policies and permit data access to the New Relic accounts you would like to view.
</Callout>

## How Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves cloud costs via storage solutions [#fetch-costs]
=======
Cloud Cost Intelligence collects telemetry data from all New Relic accounts you can access. Data from all accessible accounts will be collected and visible. Verify your account permissions align with your internal data access policies.
</Callout>

### Accessing data from storage [#fetch-costs]
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

After setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence automatically accesses cost and usage data from your object storage container. Reports must be exported to your storage container before retrieval. Configure the folder path prefix as outlined in [prerequisites](/docs/cci/prerequisites) and [setup](/docs/cci/setup) instructions.

### Data refresh frequency

Cloud providers update billing data several times daily. After initial setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves the latest report hourly. Cost data appears shortly after your provider publishes updates.

### Data processing and insights

Cloud Cost Intelligence processes CUR data to present actionable insights in dashboards. Visualize cloud usage financial implications, identify cost drivers, and find optimization opportunities.

## Privacy and security

### Data privacy

<Callout variant="important">
CUR contains cloud service usage and cost data, not personal data. Ensure data is free from personally identifiable or sensitive information before adding to your S3 bucket and uploading to New Relic. CUR data deletion is not supported. Do not generate CUR with personal or sensitive information.
</Callout>

### Data retention

Data is retained for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data moves to AWS Glacier (lower-cost storage with higher retrieval time).

### Access control

Anyone with access to your selected New Relic account can view all Cloud Cost Intelligence data. Choose an account with appropriate access privileges to match your RBAC and access policy requirements.
