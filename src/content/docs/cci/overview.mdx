<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

## Overview

Cloud Cost Intelligence bridges cost visibility and infrastructure observability, providing a holistic view of your cloud expenditures across all providers.

As enterprises scale cloud usage rapidly, managing expenses grows increasingly complex. Cloud Cost Intelligence helps identify cost savings opportunities by matching expenditures with actual usage. This enables you to optimize budgets while supporting strategic growth initiatives, ensuring every dollar contributes to your company's success.

## Features

### Intelligent summary

The [Intelligent summary](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights) page is your primary landing page, showing all cloud spending in one place. View how costs move through your organization, broken down by services, teams, and regions.

Key features:
- **Consolidated view:** All cloud spending in one place
- **Sankey chart:** Navigate and drill down into cost details
- **Cost segregation:** View costs by services, teams, and regions
- **Dynamic views:** Change views (e.g., accounts view)
- **Category breakdown:** Segment costs by application, service, team, and region
- **Trend analysis:** Track cost trends, averages, and top cost drivers

### Cost Overview

The [Cost Overview](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cost-overview) page provides detailed cost analysis with drill-down functionality from service level to individual resources.

### Kubernetes cost allocation

View Kubernetes costs broken down by application name using New Relic telemetry data.

### Real-time cost estimation

Get hourly cost updates within an hour of resource provisioning. Cost estimates use the average unit price from the past week and New Relic telemetry data from the recent 48 hours. Without this integration, estimates use standard unit pricing rates.

#### Accuracy requirements

For accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. Without this data, estimates revert to on-demand pricing.

## Data collection and processing

### Cross-account data collection

<Callout variant="important">
Cloud Cost Intelligence collects telemetry data from all New Relic accounts you can access. Data from all accessible accounts will be collected and visible. Verify your account permissions align with your internal data access policies.
</Callout>

### Accessing data from storage [#fetch-costs]

After setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence automatically accesses cost and usage data from your object storage container. Reports must be exported to your storage container before retrieval. Configure the folder path prefix as outlined in [prerequisites](/docs/cci/prerequisites) and [setup](/docs/cci/setup) instructions.

### Data refresh frequency

Cloud providers update billing data several times daily. After initial setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves the latest report hourly. Cost data appears shortly after your provider publishes updates.

### Data processing and insights

Cloud Cost Intelligence processes CUR data to present actionable insights in dashboards. Visualize cloud usage financial implications, identify cost drivers, and find optimization opportunities.

## Privacy and security

### Data privacy

<Callout variant="important">
CUR contains cloud service usage and cost data, not personal data. Ensure data is free from personally identifiable or sensitive information before adding to your S3 bucket and uploading to New Relic. CUR data deletion is not supported. Do not generate CUR with personal or sensitive information.
</Callout>

### Data retention

Data is retained for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data moves to AWS Glacier (lower-cost storage with higher retrieval time).

### Access control

Anyone with access to your selected New Relic account can view all Cloud Cost Intelligence data. Choose an account with appropriate access privileges to match your RBAC and access policy requirements.
