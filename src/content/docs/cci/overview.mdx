  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

## Overview

Cloud Cost Intelligence is designed to provide visibility and management of cloud costs. Cloud Cost Intelligence aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures across all your cloud providers.

For example, when your large enterprise scales its cloud services usage rapidly, managing and tracking cloud expenses can grow increasingly complex. Cloud Cost Intelligence helps by offering insights into your money allocation. This enables you to identify potential cost savings opportunities. By matching cloud expenditures with actual usage, you can optimize budgets while still supporting strategic growth initiatives. This approach ensures that every dollar invested contributes to your company's overall success.

## Key features

### Intelligent summary

The [Intelligent summary](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights) page is your primary landing page for Cloud Cost Intelligence. It shows all your cloud spending in one place, displaying how costs move through your organization, broken down by services, teams, and regions. You can navigate the page and change views based on your needs.

Key features include:
- **Consolidated view:** See all your cloud spending in one place
- **Sankey chart:** Dynamic Sankey chart visualization that is navigable, allowing you to drill down into cost details
- **Cost segregation:** View how costs are segregated by services, then by teams, then by regions
- **Dynamic views:** All views are dynamic in nature and can be changed (for example, change to accounts view)
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by application, service, owning team, and region
- **Trend analysis:** Gain insights into month-over-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers

### Cost Overview
The [Cost Overview](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cost-overview) page provides detailed cost analysis with drill-down functionality to explore costs across multiple dimensions, from service level down to individual resources.

### Kubernetes cost allocation
Gain visibility into Kubernetes-related costs. We leverage telemetry data from New Relic to break down costs by application name.

### Real-time cost estimation
Cloud Cost Intelligence leverages telemetry data and historical cost patterns to provide hourly cost updates, reflecting changes within an hour of resource provisioning. This integration with your billing data allows for cost estimates based on the average unit price from the past week and New Relic telemetry data for the recent 48-hour period. Without this integration, estimates default to potentially higher standard unit pricing rates.

For the most accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. This data helps calculate costs for the same instances. In the absence of such data, estimates revert to on-demand pricing, the standard pay-as-you-go model used by cloud providers.

**Cross-account data collection**<br/>
Cloud Cost Intelligence is scoped to the user and collects telemetry data from all New Relic accounts you have access to. Even if you use a single account for CCI, data from all other accounts you can access will also be collected and visible in that account. Verify your account permissions align with your internal data access policies.

## Retrieving cloud costs from storage [#fetch-costs]

Once setup is complete, Cloud Cost Intelligence automatically accesses your cost and usage data from your designated object storage container. This process begins after you grant the necessary access permissions. Please be aware that our service can only retrieve reports after they have been exported to your storage container. Ensure the folder path prefix is configured as outlined in the [prerequisites](/docs/cci/prerequisites) and respective [setup](/docs/cci/setup) instructions.

Your cloud provider typically updates billing data several times a day. After initial setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence will retrieve the latest report from your storage location on an hourly basis. The most recent cost data will appear in our platform shortly after your provider publishes the update and our service completes its retrieval cycle.

<Callout variant="important">
**Your data privacy**<br/>
CUR is data about your usage of cloud services and their costs, which should not include personal data. Ensure the data you send is free from personally identifiable information or sensitive information before adding the CUR to your S3 bucket and before it is uploaded to New Relic. CUR data deletion is not supported at this time. We recommend not generating the CUR with personally identifiable information or sensitive information.

**Data retention:** Our current data retention policy is to maintain the data for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data is moved to AWS Glacier, a lower-cost storage option with a higher retrieval time.

**Viewing access:** Be aware that anyone with access to the New Relic account you select during installation will be able to view all data within Cloud Cost Intelligence. Choose an account with suitable access privileges to match your RBAC and access policy requirements.

### Data analysis and reporting
After retrieving the CUR data, Cloud Cost Intelligence processes and analyzes this information to present actionable insights in its dashboards. You can visualize the financial implications of your cloud usage with clarity, identifying cost drivers and potential areas for optimization.
