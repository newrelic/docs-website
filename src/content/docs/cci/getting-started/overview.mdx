Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) is designed to provide comprehensive visibility and management of AWS cloud costs. Positioned within the rapidly growing Financial Operations (FinOps) space, CCI aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures.

Imagine a startup that's quickly expanding its use of AWS services. Tracking and managing these cloud expenses can get overwhelming. CCI helps by showing exactly where money is being spent, so the startup can find areas for cost savings. By aligning cloud spending with usage, startups can better manage their budget while still supporting growth. This ensures that every dollar spent is contributing effectively to the company’s success.

## Key benefits
Here’s how CCI can benefit you:

### Comprehensive cost visibility
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by product, service, team, and region, enabling detailed analysis and understanding of expenditure.
- **Trend analysis:** CCI provides insights into month-on-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers, helping you identify patterns and potential areas for cost optimization.
- **Anomaly detection:** The platform highlights cost spikes and anomalies, allowing you to quickly identify and address unexpected expenses.

### Kubernetes cost allocation
CCI offers visibility into Kubernetes-related costs, including pods and ingress/egress expenses, which is crucial for teams managing complex Kubernetes environments.

### Real-time cost estimation
- **Immediate cost updates:** Unlike traditional tools that have a latency of up to two days, CCI provides near real-time cost updates, reflecting changes within minutes of resource provisioning.
- **Estimation accuracy:** The platform uses telemetry data and historical cost patterns to estimate costs, offering users timely insights into their cloud spending.

    **Disclaimer**<p/>
    Real-time cost estimates for the past 48 hours are based on telemetry and historical data, not on actual incurred costs. These estimates provide provisional insights until AWS’s official Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) are available, and are for informational purposes only. These figures may not exactly match the final incurred costs reflected in your official billing statements.

## How CCI retrieves AWS S3 data
CCI is designed to automatically access your AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR), which are stored in your designated S3 bucket. This process begins with your authorization and the provision of access permissions.

Once access is established, CCI continuously pulls the latest CUR files from your S3 bucket. This automated and seamless data retrieval ensures that you have the most current financial information available.

**Data Privacy Notice**<p/>
Customers should ensure that Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) do not contain personal data when used with Cloud Cost Insights (CCI). Currently, the CUR does not support data deletion from the New Relic product, so it is crucial to exclude any personal information at the data source.

### Data analysis and reporting
After retrieving the CUR data, CCI processes and analyzes this information to present actionable insights in its dashboards. You can visualize the financial implications of your cloud usage with clarity, identifying cost drivers and potential areas for optimization.

## Future enhancements
While the initial release focuses on visibility, future iterations of CCI will include advanced features such as cost optimization recommendations. These enhancements will leverage accumulated data and insights to provide actionable suggestions for reducing cloud expenditures.

## Differentiation
CCI stands out in the FinOps market through its unique combination of real-time cost estimation and integration with telemetry data. This approach not only provides immediate insights but also aligns cost data with operational metrics, offering a more comprehensive view of cloud resource utilization.

## Conclusion
Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) is a powerful tool for organizations looking to gain control over cloud expenditures. By providing detailed visibility, real-time updates, and future optimization capabilities, CCI empowers you to make informed decisions and optimize your cloud investments effectively.
