<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence is designed to provide visibility and management of cloud costs. Cloud Cost Intelligence aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures.

For example, as your large enterprise rapidly scales its use of cloud services, tracking and managing cloud expenses can become increasingly complex. Cloud Cost Intelligence assists by providing insights into where your money is being allocated. This can help you identify areas for potential cost savings. By aligning cloud expenditures with actual usage, you can optimize your budgets while continuing to support strategic growth initiatives. This approach helps ensure that every dollar you invest is contributing to your company's overall success.

## Key features

### Comprehensive cost visibility
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by application, service, owning team, and region.
- **Trend analysis:** Gain insights into month-over-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers.

### Kubernetes cost allocation
Gain visibility into Kubernetes-related costs. We leverage telemetry data from New Relic to break down costs by application name.

### Real-time cost estimation
Cloud Cost Intelligence leverages telemetry data and historical cost patterns to provide hourly cost updates, reflecting changes within an hour of resource provisioning. This integration with your billing data allows for cost estimates based on the average unit price from the past week and New Relic telemetry data for the recent 48-hour period. Without this integration, estimates default to potentially higher standard unit pricing rates.

For the most accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. This data helps calculate costs for the same instances. In the absence of such data, estimates revert to on-demand pricing, the standard pay-as-you-go model used by cloud providers.

**Cross-account data collection**<br/>
Cloud Cost Intelligence is scoped to the user and collects telemetry data from all accounts associated with your New Relic user credentials. This means that even if you're using a single New Relic account for Cloud Cost Intelligence, telemetry data from any additional New Relic accounts you have access to will also be collected and visible within that single New Relic account. Verify that your user account permissions are in line with your internal policies and permit data access to the New Relic accounts you would like to view.

## How Cloud Cost Intelligence retrieves cloud costs via storage solutions [#fetch-costs]

Once setup is complete, Cloud Cost Intelligence automatically accesses your cost and usage data from your designated object storage container. This process begins after you grant the necessary access permissions. Please be aware that our service can only retrieve reports after they have been exported to your storage container. Ensure the folder path prefix is configured as outlined in the [prerequisites](/docs/cci/getting-started/prerequisites) and respective [setup](/docs/cci/getting-started/setup) instructions.

Your cloud provider typically updates billing data several times a day. After initial setup, Cloud Cost Intelligence will retrieve the latest report from your storage location on an hourly basis. The most recent cost data will appear in our platform shortly after your provider publishes the update and our service completes its retrieval cycle.

**Your data privacy**<br/>
CUR is data about your usage of cloud services and their costs, which should not include personal data. Ensure the data you send is free from personally identifiable information or sensitive information before adding the CUR to your S3 bucket and before it is uploaded to New Relic. CUR data deletion is not supported at this time. We recommend not generating the CUR with personally identifiable information or sensitive information.

**Data retention:** Our current data retention policy is to maintain the data for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data is moved to AWS Glacier, a lower-cost storage option with a higher retrieval time.

**Viewing access:** Be aware that anyone with access to the New Relic account you select during installation will be able to view all data within Cloud Cost Intelligence. Choose an account with suitable access privileges to match your RBAC and access policy requirements.

### Data analysis and reporting
After retrieving the CUR data, Cloud Cost Intelligence processes and analyzes this information to present actionable insights in its dashboards. You can visualize the financial implications of your cloud usage with clarity, identifying cost drivers and potential areas for optimization.
