Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) is designed to provide comprehensive visibility and management of cloud costs. Positioned within the rapidly growing Financial Operations (FinOps) space, CCI aims to bridge the gap between cost visibility and infrastructure observability, offering you a holistic view of your cloud expenditures.

For your large enterprise rapidly scaling its use of AWS services, tracking and managing cloud expenses can become increasingly complex. CCI assists by providing detailed insights into where your money is being allocated, enabling you to identify areas for potential cost savings. By aligning cloud expenditures with actual usage, you can optimize your budgets while continuing to support strategic growth initiatives. This approach ensures that every dollar you invest is effectively contributing to your company’s overall success.

## Key benefits
Here’s how CCI can benefit you:

### Comprehensive cost visibility
- **Breakdown by category:** View cloud costs segmented by product, service, team, and region, enabling detailed analysis and understanding of expenditure.
- **Trend analysis:** CCI provides insights into month-on-month cost trends, average costs, and top cost drivers, helping you identify patterns and potential areas for cost optimization.
- **Anomaly detection:** The platform highlights cost spikes and anomalies, allowing you to quickly identify and address unexpected expenses.

### Kubernetes cost allocation
CCI offers visibility into Kubernetes-related costs, including pods and ingress/egress expenses, which is crucial for teams managing complex Kubernetes environments.

### Real-time cost estimation
- **Immediate cost updates:** CCI provides near real-time cost updates, reflecting changes within minutes of resource provisioning. This allows for timely insights into spending.

    **Disclaimer**<p/>
    If you provide pricing data from the past week, CCI will use it to estimate costs for the recent 48-hour period. Otherwise, estimates use standard pricing rates<InlinePopover type="standard pricing rates"/>, which may result in higher estimates than actual costs. These estimates are based on historical usage and may not exactly match your final charges.
    </Callout>
    **Note:** Standard pricing rates refer to the default charging rates set by cloud providers (also known as list prices), which do not include discounts or special pricing agreements.
- **Estimation accuracy:** The platform uses telemetry data combined with the average cost over the past 7 days for similar instances to estimate costs. To achieve the most accurate estimates, integrate telemetry and maintain at least 7 days of historical data. If similar instances or recent data are unavailable, estimates default to on-demand pricing.
Infobubble on on-demand pricing: On-demand pricing is the standard pay-as-you-go model used by cloud providers, charging based on actual usage without long-term commitments.

The platform uses telemetry data and historical cost patterns to estimate costs, offering users timely insights into their cloud spending.


## How CCI retrieves AWS S3 data
CCI automatically accesses your AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR), which are stored in your designated S3 bucket. This process begins with your authorization and the provision of access permissions.

Once access is established, CCI continuously pulls the latest CUR files from your S3 bucket. This automated and seamless data retrieval ensures that you have the most current financial information available.

**Ensure data privacy**<p/>
Take steps to ensure your data remains private and secure. As of now, we cannot delete Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) data that is processed by Cloud Cost Intelligence. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure the data you send is free from personal or sensitive information.

**Data retention:** Our current data retention policy is to maintain the data for up to 5 years. After 2 years, data is moved to AWS Glacier, a lower-cost storage option with a higher retrieval time.

**Viewing access:** Be aware that anyone with access to the New Relic account you select during installation will be able to view all data within Cloud Cost Intelligence. Choose an account with suitable access privileges to match your data privacy and security requirements.
</Callout>

### Data analysis and reporting
After retrieving the CUR data, CCI processes and analyzes this information to present actionable insights in its dashboards. You can visualize the financial implications of your cloud usage with clarity, identifying cost drivers and potential areas for optimization.

{/* ## Future enhancements
While the initial release focuses on visibility, future iterations of CCI will include advanced features such as cost optimization recommendations. These enhancements will leverage accumulated data and insights to provide actionable suggestions for reducing cloud expenditures. */}

## Differentiation
CCI stands out in the FinOps market through its unique combination of real-time cost estimation and integration with telemetry data. This approach not only provides immediate insights but also aligns cost data with operational metrics, offering a more comprehensive view of cloud resource utilization.

## Conclusion
CCI is a powerful tool for organizations looking to gain control over cloud expenditures. By providing detailed visibility, real-time updates, and future optimization capabilities, CCI empowers you to make informed decisions and optimize your cloud investments effectively.
