Learn how to seamlessly set up Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) with AWS by configuring essential integration settings, including IAM roles and data export paths. This guide walks you through the required steps to enable detailed cost analysis and management within your New Relic platform, ensuring streamlined access to your AWS Cost and Usage Reports.

Follow these steps to configure CCI for integration with your AWS account:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Log in

    Log in to New Relic.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Start integrating

    Click **Cloud Cost Intelligence** on the left panel, and then click **Add the integration**.
    Alternatively, click **Integrations & Agents** on the left panel, look for Cloud Cost Intelligence amongst all capabilities, and then click **Cloud Cost Intelligence**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Meet prerequisites

    Read the prerequisites. Ensure you meet them.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Select account

    Select the New Relic account that you want to use for the setup, and click **Continue**.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Provide connection details

    Enter the following details required to fetch cost data from AWS:
        - **Connection name:** Filled in by default. Edit if you want a custom name instead.
        - **Data export name:** The name of the data export file. Used to construct the path to the corresponding CUR file. ​​For a report named cci-ingestion-test, the constructed path would be cost-and-usage-reports/cci-ingestion-test/data. This would be where CUR data is stored within the S3 bucket.
        - **Cross-account IAM role ARN:** The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that CCI will assume to access your S3 bucket. An ARN is a unique identifier for various AWS resources, including IAM roles. It follows a standard format that includes the service, region, account ID, and resource specifics—such as `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>`.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Test connection

    Finally, initiate a test to verify that the connection to your AWS environment is successful.
