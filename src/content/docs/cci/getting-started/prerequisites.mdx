  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Prepare your AWS environment for Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) integration by following these prerequisites, including setting up consolidated billing, enabling cost and usage reports, configuring IAM roles and policies for secure access, and activating necessary AWS regions. Ensure your setup supports effective cost analysis and management within the New Relic platform.

## Prerequisites

  <Collapser
    id="aws-account-permissions"
    title="AWS account with appropriate permissions"
  >
    Ensure the [consolidated billing is set up for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html). This consolidates billing across all accounts in your organization for unified cost management.

  AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) will be stored in an S3 bucket. We recommend the S3 bucket to be created in the `us-east-2` region. Follow these steps to create a dedicated bucket:
  
    1. Sign in to the **AWS Management Console**.
    2. Navigate to S3 service.
    3. Click **Create bucket**.
    4. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g `<your-company-name>-billing`).
    5. Configure bucket settings:
        <ul>
            <li>Enable versioning</li>
            <li>Disable public access (recommended)</li>
            <li>Enable default encryption (recommended)</li>
        </ul>
    6. **Tags (Optional)**: Add any tags if needed for your organization's resource management.
    7. Click **Create bucket**.

    <Callout variant="important">
    Remember the bucket name as you'll need them in the following steps and installation steps on CCI.

  Create a Cost and Usage Report to be delivered to your S3 bucket:

    1. Sign in to the **AWS Management Console**.
    2. Navigate to the **Billing Dashboard**.
    3. In the left navigation pane, click **Cost & Usage Analysis**.
    4. Click **Data Exports** and then **Create**.
    5. Configure report settings:

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Prerequisites for Kubernetes cost allocation

- [Install the Kubernetes integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/kubernetes/). AWS Fargate integration is not supported for this feature.
- Beyond the standard Kubernetes labels (`app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, `app.kubernetes.io/component`, and `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`), consider adding two custom labels such as `environment` and `team` to indicate the deployment environment and the responsible team. Also, consider adding two custom resource tags such as `project` and `costCenter`. These labels and resource tags will help you better segment and analyze your Kubernetes cost allocation data.

## Recommendations

- Configure [cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html) in your AWS account. Tagging facilitates detailed and meaningful cost categorization. Ensure that at least two custom resource tags are consistently applied across your AWS resources for effective cost filtering and grouping.
- Use an S3 bucket located in the `us-east-2` region for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Access control advisory
All users with access to the designated New Relic account/organization can view your AWS cloud cost data within Cloud Cost Intelligence. We encourage you to carefully select the appropriate New Relic account/organization that aligns with your internal access control policies to ensure secure and compliant handling of cloud cost data.

<Callout variant="important">
**S3 bucket access**<p/>
New Relic only requires read access to your S3 bucket, and this access is limited to a single IAM role from the New Relic side. Ensure that this access level is maintained to protect your data while facilitating necessary operations.
