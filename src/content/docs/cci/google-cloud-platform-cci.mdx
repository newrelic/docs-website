The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration for Cloud Cost Insights enables you to monitor and analyze your GCP cloud spending directly within New Relic. This integration uses a service account-based authorization method to securely access your GCP BigQuery billing and pricing data.

When you set up this integration, New Relic creates a dedicated service account in its GCP environment on your behalf. You grant this service account read-only access to your BigQuery datasets, allowing New Relic to retrieve and analyze your cost data without requiring broader access to your GCP resources.

## Key features
  - Automated service account generation per New Relic account
  - Secure, read-only access to billing data via BigQuery
  - Access to both billing export and cloud pricing export tables
  - Connection validation and error reporting

## Prerequisites

  Before setting up the GCP integration, ensure you have the following:

  New Relic requirements:
  - Active New Relic account with Cloud Cost Insights access
  - Account ID where you want to configure the GCP integration

  Google Cloud Platform requirements:
  - Active GCP account with billing enabled
  - Access to Google Cloud Console
  - BigQuery dataset with the following tables configured:
    - Billing Export table - Contains your GCP billing data
    - Cloud Pricing Export table - Contains GCP pricing information
  - Fully qualified table names for both tables in the format: project_id.dataset_name.table_name

  Permissions required:
  - Ability to manage BigQuery dataset permissions in your GCP account
  - Permission to grant the BigQuery Data Viewer role to external service accounts
