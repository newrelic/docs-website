<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview

Connect your Azure billing to Cloud Cost Intelligence for complete cost monitoring and optimization. Get real-time visibility into spending patterns, resource use, and cost allocation across services and resource groups.

Key capabilities:
  - **Optimize resources** - Identify underutilized or costly services and adjust allocations
  - **Control costs** - Track cost drivers across compute, storage, networking, and databases
  - **Multi-subscription monitoring** - View spending across subscriptions and management groups
  - **Cost accountability** - Enable chargeback using Azure tags and resource groups
  - **Budget management** - Set alerts for spending thresholds and limits

## Before you begin

### Required permissions

Ensure you have:
  - **Azure subscription** with active billing account
  - **Contributor or Owner role** on the subscription
  - **Azure Cost Management access**
  - **Billing reader permissions** for subscription or management group
  - **Completed billing export configuration** - See [Azure billing export setup](#azure-billing-export-setup)

### Azure billing export setup

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser

    title="Azure billing export configuration"
  >
    Determine whether a billing export already exists that matches the parameters specified below:
      - **If a matching export exists**: Proceed with your setup process using the existing export.
      - **If no matching export exists**: Follow the steps below to create a new billing export.

      1. Access Azure Cost Management

          1. Navigate to the **Azure Console > Cost Management & Billing > Billing Scope**.
          2. Expand the **Settings** section and click **Exports**.

      2. Create new export

          1. Click **Create**.
          2. Select **Cost and Usage (FOCUS)** as the export type.

            <Callout variant="important">
              For EA and MCA the export type format should be **Cost and usage details (FOCUS) : 1.2-preview..**
            </Callout>
          3. Provide an export prefix for identification purposes.

      3. Configure export parameters

          Configure the export with the following parameters:

            <table>

              </tbody>
            </table>

            <Callout variant="important">
              We recommend the storage account to be based in **(US) East US**. This helps save on outbound data transfer costs. The storage type should be **Azure Blob storage**.
