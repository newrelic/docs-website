<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Set up your AWS environment for Cloud Cost Intelligence by configuring consolidated billing, Cost and Usage Reports (CUR), Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies, and necessary AWS regions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting either setup method:

### Required for all setups

- **AWS account with consolidated billing**: [Set up consolidated billing for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html). This is required to aggregate cost data from all accounts in your organization, enabling comprehensive cost analysis across your entire AWS infrastructure.
- **IAM Privileges**: Administrative access to the target AWS account is required to deploy resources, create S3 buckets, IAM policies, and IAM roles.

### Required for automated setup only

- **New Relic API Key**: Generate a valid API key for stack creation. We recommend creating a dedicated key for CCI integration. Generate this in the New Relic UI: [User menu > API Keys](https://onenr.io/07wklp68lRL).

## Choose your setup method

Cloud Cost Intelligence offers two ways to set up AWS integration:

- [**Automate AWS with CloudFormation (Recommended)**](/docs/cci/get-started/aws/automated-setup-cloudformation): Quickly deploy a pre-configured CloudFormation stack that automatically provisions all required AWS resources. Best for faster onboarding with minimal manual configuration.
- [**Manually integrate your AWS account**](/docs/cci/get-started/aws/manual-integrate-aws-account): Manually configure each AWS resource for complete control over the setup process. Best for organizations with specific compliance or customization requirements.
