<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The Cost Overview page (formerly known as Cost Explorer) provides detailed cost analysis with drill-down functionality across multiple dimensions.

For a consolidated view of all your cloud spending with summary widgets, see the [Intelligent summary](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights) page.

## Drill-down functionality

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides drill-down capacity to view granular cost details.

### How it works

You can look at costs across different dimensions. When you click on a service (for example, EC2), you can drill down to a particular service, and then within that, to a particular resource to look at granular details of that resource.

All service types support drill-down, including compute, network, and storage.

## Features

- **Filterable**: All data is filterable and you can show and hide elements
- **Multiple views**: You can change views to see data in different formats
- **Group by options**: You can have multiple group-by options. For example, you can view by cloud service dimension, then change it to charge type and payment option
- **Pivot table view**: When using multiple group-by selections, data reflects as a pivot table view to analyze granular costs within a single view
- **Download**: You can download the cost data to analyze it across different dimensions

## Group-by constraints

- **Minimum selection**: 1 dimension
- **Maximum selection**: 3 dimensions

<Callout variant="important">
When you have multiple group-by selections, bar chart, line chart, and tree chart are not applicable. Only data table and heat map are available.
