The Cost Overview page (formerly Cost Explorer) provides detailed cost analysis with drill-down functionality across multiple dimensions.

For consolidated spending view with summary widgets, see [Intelligent summary](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights).

All service types support drill-down: compute, network, and storage.

- **Group by options**: Use multiple group-by options (e.g., cloud service, charge type, payment option)
- **Pivot table view**: Analyze granular costs in a single view with multiple group-by selections
- **Download**: Download cost data for external analysis

## Group-by constraints

- **Minimum**: 1 dimension
- **Maximum**: 3 dimensions
