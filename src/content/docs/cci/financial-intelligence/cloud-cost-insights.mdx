    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blended costs</td>
    <td>Reflects the average cost of usage across your consolidated billing family, including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, On-Demand Instances, and tiered products. Blended costs are calculated by multiplying the blended rate for each service with your account’s usage of that service.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unblended costs</td>
    <td>Represents usage costs on the day they're charged, showing costs on a cash basis. This can be used to review the Reserved Instances and Savings Plan costs on the exact day of charge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net unblended costs</td>
    <td>Your unblended costs after all applicable discounts have been applied.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amortized costs</td>
    <td>Reflects costs in terms of accrual accounting, spreading expenses across the billing period. For example, if you pay a $365 upfront Savings Plan for one year, you'll see a $1 amortized cost per day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net amortized costs</td>
