Once your Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI) setup is complete, you can gain comprehensive insights into your cloud expenditures through the Summary page. The Summary page offers a variety of widgets that deliver crucial data regarding your cloud costs, along with various cost types for detailed analysis.

## Cost types
Cloud Cost Intelligence provides a comprehensive view of your cloud expenditures through its interactive widgets. To gain deeper insights and optimize your financial management, you can view the data in these widgets categorized by different cost types. Each cost type offers a distinct perspective on your cloud expenses, whether you're analyzing daily charges or spreading costs over time. Here are the cost types you can utilize for a more tailored view:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Cost Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blended costs</td>
    <td>Reflects the average cost of usage across your consolidated billing family, including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, On-Demand Instances, and tiered products. Blended costs are calculated by multiplying the blended rate for each service with your account’s usage of that service.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unblended costs</td>
    <td>Represents usage costs on the day they're charged, showing costs on a cash basis. Useful for seeing Reserved Instances and Savings Plan fees on the exact day of charge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net unblended costs</td>
    <td>Your unblended costs after all applicable discounts have been applied.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amortized costs</td>
    <td>Reflects costs in terms of accrual accounting, spreading expenses across the billing period. For example, if you pay a $365 upfront Savings Plan for one year, you'll see a $1 amortized cost per day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net amortized costs</td>
    <td>Amortized costs after all discounts are applied, providing a net view of accrued expenses.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

{/* - **Blended costs:** This reflects the average cost of usage across your consolidated billing family, including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, On-Demand Instances, and tiered products. Blended costs are calculated by multiplying the blended rate for each service with your account’s usage of that service.
- **Unblended costs:** These represent your usage costs on the day they're charged, showing costs on a cash basis. This is particularly useful for viewing Reserved Instances and Savings Plan fees on the exact day of the charge.
- **Net unblended costs:** These are your unblended costs after all applicable discounts have been applied.
- **Amortized costs:** This reflects your costs in terms of accrual accounting, spreading expenses across the billing period. With this view, the costs are amortized over the billing period. On the first of the month, you see the unused portion of your upfront fees and recurring charges. For example, if you paid a $365 all upfront Savings Plans for one year and you have a matching instance that uses the Savings Plans, then you will see a $1 amortized cost per day.
- **Net Amortized Costs:** This reflects you amortized costs after all discounts are applied. */}
