<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Cost type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blended costs</td>
    <td>Reflects the average cost of usage across your consolidated billing family, including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, On-Demand Instances, and tiered products. Blended costs are calculated by multiplying the blended rate for each service with your account’s usage of that service.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unblended costs</td>
    <td>Represents usage costs on the day they're charged, showing costs on a cash basis. This can be used to review the Reserved Instances and Savings Plan costs on the exact day of charge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net unblended costs</td>
    <td>Your unblended costs after all applicable discounts have been applied.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amortized costs</td>
    <td>Reflects costs in terms of accrual accounting, spreading expenses across the billing period. For example, if you pay a $365 upfront Savings Plan for one year, you'll see a $1 amortized cost per day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Net amortized costs</td>
    <td>Amortized costs after all discounts are applied, providing a net view of accrued expenses.</td>
  </tr>

## Data widgets

The dashboard offers widgets that provide insights into your cloud spending:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Widget</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total cost</td>
    <td>Displays your total cloud spend over a specified period for a holistic view of overall expenses. Quickly assess any significant increases or decreases.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Average cost by selected granularity</td>
    <td>Presents your average cloud costs based on the granularity selected in the UI, such as by hour, day, week, or month. This feature helps track spending patterns over time, allowing you to identify trends and fluctuations for proactive planning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Real-time cost estimate</td>
    <td>Provides near real-time estimates of your cloud expenses based on recent telemetry and historical data. Explore further with a pane showing estimated total, estimated average hourly, and estimated live costs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Top 5 cost variance</td>
    <td>Highlights the top five services or resources experiencing the most significant cost changes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cost spread per region</td>
    <td>Visualizes your cloud spending distributed across geographic regions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tagged vs. untagged resources</td>
    <td>Displays the cost proportion of resources tagged at the application and team levels in AWS, as reported in the Cost and Usage Report (CUR). Resources with custom tags outside these categories are classified as untagged. Standardized tagging enhances resource management and cost attribution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Service category costs</td>
    <td>Summarizes costs across key cloud service categories, adapting dynamically based on your highest areas of expenditure. Categories typically include compute, storage, databases, network, taxes, and credits.</td>
