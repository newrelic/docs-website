<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Access insights specific to your Kubernetes environments through the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page. This feature leverages New Relic's telemetry data to provide a view of the costs associated with your Kubernetes applications.

Use the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page to view costs incurred by each application over time and details cost analysis:

## Allocation overview
The Allocation Overview widget offers a bar chart visualization, illustrating the costs incurred by each application over time.

## Detailed cost analysis
The Kubernetes Cost Allocation view also presents a detailed table, providing a breakdown of resource usage and costs by application name:

- **CPU usage:** Displays the percentage of CPU resources consumed by each application.
- **CPU cost:** Shows the cost attributed to CPU usage for each application.
- **Memory usage:** Lists the memory resources by percentage used by each application.
- **Memory cost:** Reflects the cost associated with memory usage.
- **Total cost:** Provides the total cost incurred by each application, integrating all resource usage.

## Efficiency metrics

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides two key efficiency dimensions to help you understand and optimize your Kubernetes cluster utilization:

### Unused cost
**Unused cost** represents the cost of resources that have been allocated to your cluster but are not actively receiving requests. This metric identifies waste in your resource allocation strategy.

- **What it measures**: The gap between what you've allocated to pods/containers and what those pods/containers are actually requesting
- **Example**: If you allocate $5.60 to a cluster but only $4.64 is being used, the unused cost is $0.96
- **Why it matters**: High unused costs indicate that you're paying for resources that have been allocated but aren't being utilized by your applications

<Callout variant="tip">
To reduce unused costs, consider right-sizing your pod resource requests to match actual usage patterns, or implementing horizontal pod autoscaling to better match capacity to demand.
</Callout>

### Unallocated cost
**Unallocated cost** represents the cost of cluster resources that haven't been allocated to any workload at all. These are resources available in the cluster but not assigned to any pods or applications.

- **What it measures**: The portion of your cluster capacity that hasn't been allocated to any pods or containers
- **Example**: If your cluster has 100 CPU cores but only 85 are allocated to pods, the cost of those 15 unallocated cores appears as unallocated cost
- **Why it matters**: Unallocated costs indicate you're paying for cluster capacity that isn't even available to your applications

<Callout variant="tip">
To reduce unallocated costs, consider downsizing your cluster to match your allocation needs, or schedule additional workloads to use the available capacity.
</Callout>

### Understanding the efficiency flow

Your Kubernetes costs flow through three stages:

1. **Total cluster cost**: What you pay for the entire cluster infrastructure
2. **Allocated cost**: Resources assigned to pods and containers (Total - Unallocated)
3. **Used cost**: Resources actively being requested by workloads (Allocated - Unused)

**Optimal efficiency** means minimizing both unused and unallocated costs, ensuring you're paying only for resources that are both allocated to workloads and actively being used.

<Callout variant="important">
These efficiency metrics help you identify two different types of waste:
- **Unused cost** = Overprovisioned applications (allocated but not requested)
- **Unallocated cost** = Oversized clusters (capacity not allocated to any workload)

Addressing both types of waste is essential for optimizing your Kubernetes spending.
</Callout>

## Benefits
By utilizing the Kubernetes Cost Allocation feature, you can:

- **Optimize resource usage:** Identify underutilized or excessively costly applications to adjust resource allocations effectively.
- **Control expenses:** Gain visibility into specific cost drivers within your Kubernetes environment, enabling more informed financial decisions.
- **Enhance efficiency:** Focus on resource management strategies that align with business objectives to ensure efficient use of cloud resources.
- **Measure cluster efficiency:** Use unused and unallocated cost metrics to identify waste in your resource allocation and cluster sizing strategies.
- **Reduce waste systematically:** Address both application-level overprovisioning (unused costs) and cluster-level oversizing (unallocated costs) to maximize cost efficiency.

The Kubernetes Cost Allocation page equips you with the insights necessary to proactively manage Kubernetes costs, supporting strategic decision-making and financial optimization.
