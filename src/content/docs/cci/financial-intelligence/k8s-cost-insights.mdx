<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview

Access insights specific to your Kubernetes environments through the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page. This feature leverages New Relic's telemetry data to provide a view of the costs associated with your Kubernetes applications.

Use the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page to view costs incurred by each application over time and detailed cost analysis.

## Allocation overview

The Allocation Overview widget offers a bar chart visualization illustrating the costs incurred by each application over time.

## Detailed cost analysis

The Kubernetes Cost Allocation view presents a detailed table with a breakdown of resource usage and costs by application name:

  - **CPU usage:** Displays the percentage of CPU resources consumed by each application.
  - **CPU cost:** Shows the cost attributed to CPU usage for each application.
  - **Memory usage:** Lists the memory resources by percentage used by each application.
  - **Memory cost:** Reflects the cost associated with memory usage.
  - **Total cost:** Provides the total cost incurred by each application, integrating all resource usage.

## Unused and Unallocated cost

These cost dimensions help you measure cluster efficiency:

### Unused cost
Unused cost is how much of the cluster has been allocated but is not getting any request.

**Example**: If your total cost is $5.60 allocated to a cluster deployment, but you're only using $4.64, then $0.96 is unused cost.

### Unallocated cost
Unallocated cost is how much of the cluster has not been allocated itself to any source.

These are efficiency measures for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Benefits
The Kubernetes Cost Allocation feature delivers these outcomes:

- **Optimized resource usage:** Visibility into underutilized or excessively costly applications enables effective resource allocation adjustments.
- **Controlled expenses:** Insights into specific cost drivers within your Kubernetes environment enable more informed financial decisions.
- **Enhanced efficiency:** Resource management strategies aligned with business objectives ensure efficient use of cloud resources.

The Kubernetes Cost Allocation page provides the insights necessary to proactively manage Kubernetes costs, supporting strategic decision-making and financial optimization.
