Within Cloud Cost Intelligence (CCI), you can access detailed insights specific to your Kubernetes environments through the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page. This powerful feature provides a comprehensive view of the costs associated with your Kubernetes applications, allowing for effective management and optimization.

This section is designed to help you understand and manage costs attributed to your containerized applications.

## Allocation overview
The Allocation Overview widget offers a bar chart visualization, illustrating the costs incurred by each application over time. This enables you to quickly identify which applications are contributing most significantly to your overall Kubernetes expenses.

## Detailed cost analysis
The Kubernetes Cost Allocation view also presents a detailed table, providing a breakdown of resource usage and costs by application name:

- **CPU usage:** Displays the amount of CPU resources consumed by each application.
- **CPU cost:** Shows the cost attributed to CPU usage for each application.
- **Memory usage:** Lists the memory resources utilized by each application.
- **Memory cost:** Reflects the cost associated with memory usage.
- **Total cost:** Provides the total cost incurred by each application, integrating all resource usage.

## Benefits
By utilizing the Kubernetes Cost Allocation feature, you can:

- **Optimize resource usage:** Identify underutilized or excessively costly applications to adjust resource allocations effectively.
- **Control expenses:** Gain visibility into specific cost drivers within the Kubernetes environment, enabling more informed financial decisions.
- **Enhance efficiency:** Focus on resource management strategies that align with business objectives to ensure efficient use of cloud resources.

The Kubernetes Cost Allocation page equips you with the insights necessary to proactively manage Kubernetes costs, supporting strategic decision-making and financial optimization.
