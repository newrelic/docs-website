The Kubernetes Cost Allocation page provides insights into Kubernetes costs using New Relic telemetry data.

## Allocation overview

View costs incurred by each application over time through bar chart visualization.

## Detailed cost analysis

The detailed table breaks down resource usage and costs by application:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
- **CPU usage:** Percentage of CPU resources consumed per application
- **CPU cost:** Cost attributed to CPU usage
- **Memory usage:** Memory resources by percentage used
- **Memory cost:** Cost associated with memory usage
- **Total cost:** Total cost per application across all resource usage

## Unused and Unallocated costs

Two cost dimensions help measure cluster efficiency:

### Unused cost

Amount of cluster allocated but not receiving requests.

**Example**: Total cost $5.60 allocated to cluster deployment, but only using $4.64 = $0.96 unused cost.

### Unallocated cost

Amount of cluster not allocated to any source.
