<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Access insights specific to your Kubernetes environments through the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page. This feature leverages New Relic's telemetry data to provide a view of the costs associated with your Kubernetes applications.

Use the Kubernetes Cost Allocation page to view costs incurred by each application over time and details cost analysis:

## Allocation overview
The Allocation Overview widget offers a bar chart visualization, illustrating the costs incurred by each application over time.

## Detailed cost analysis
The Kubernetes Cost Allocation view also presents a detailed table, providing a breakdown of resource usage and costs by application name:

- **CPU usage:** Displays the percentage of CPU resources consumed by each application.
- **CPU cost:** Shows the cost attributed to CPU usage for each application.
- **Memory usage:** Lists the memory resources by percentage used by each application.
- **Memory cost:** Reflects the cost associated with memory usage.
- **Total cost:** Provides the total cost incurred by each application, integrating all resource usage.

## New dimensions: Unused and Unallocated cost

Two new cost dimensions have been added to help you measure cluster efficiency:

### Unused cost
Unused cost is how much of the cluster has been allocated but is not getting any request.

**Example**: If your total cost is $5.60 allocated to a cluster deployment, but you're only using $4.64, then $0.96 is unused cost.

### Unallocated cost
Unallocated cost is how much of the cluster has not been allocated itself to any source.

These are efficiency measures for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Benefits
By utilizing the Kubernetes Cost Allocation feature, you can:

- **Optimize resource usage:** Identify underutilized or excessively costly applications to adjust resource allocations effectively.
- **Control expenses:** Gain visibility into specific cost drivers within your Kubernetes environment, enabling more informed financial decisions.
- **Enhance efficiency:** Focus on resource management strategies that align with business objectives to ensure efficient use of cloud resources.

The Kubernetes Cost Allocation page equips you with the insights necessary to proactively manage Kubernetes costs, supporting strategic decision-making and financial optimization.
