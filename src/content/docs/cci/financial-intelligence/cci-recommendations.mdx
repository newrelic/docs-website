<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides intelligent cost optimization recommendations to help you reduce your AWS cloud spending. By analyzing your usage patterns and resource configurations, CCI identifies opportunities for cost savings through multiple recommendation sources.

<Callout variant="important">
Cost optimization recommendations are currently available for AWS only.
</Callout>

## Recommendation sources

Cloud Cost Intelligence aggregates recommendations from three different sources to provide comprehensive cost optimization guidance:

### AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is Amazon's built-in advisory service that provides real-time guidance to help you optimize your AWS infrastructure. Cloud Cost Intelligence integrates with Trusted Advisor to surface cost optimization recommendations directly within the CCI interface.

#### What Trusted Advisor provides

Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS account and provides recommendations across multiple categories, including:
- **Cost optimization**: Identify idle or underutilized resources
- **Performance improvements**: Detect service limits and performance bottlenecks
- **Security best practices**: Find security gaps in your configuration
- **Fault tolerance**: Improve availability and redundancy

For cost optimization specifically, Trusted Advisor can identify:
- Idle or underutilized EC2 instances
- Unattached EBS volumes
- Underutilized load balancers
- Idle RDS database instances
- Opportunities to use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans

#### Setting up Trusted Advisor

To enable Trusted Advisor recommendations in Cloud Cost Intelligence:

1. **Verify your AWS support plan**: Trusted Advisor's full feature set requires an AWS Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan. The Basic and Developer support plans provide access to only a limited set of checks.

2. **Grant necessary permissions**: Ensure your AWS IAM role used for CCI integration has the following permissions:
   ```
   trustedadvisor:Describe*
   support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks
   support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult
   ```

3. **Enable Trusted Advisor checks**: In the AWS Console, navigate to Trusted Advisor and ensure cost optimization checks are enabled.

4. **Wait for data synchronization**: Once configured, Cloud Cost Intelligence will begin importing Trusted Advisor recommendations. This process may take up to 24 hours for the initial sync.

<Callout variant="tip">
Trusted Advisor checks are refreshed automatically by AWS on a regular basis. Some checks update weekly, while others update daily. Cloud Cost Intelligence syncs with Trusted Advisor regularly to ensure you're seeing the most current recommendations.

### Right-sizing recommendations (CCI ML model)

Cloud Cost Intelligence uses machine learning models to analyze your resource usage patterns and identify right-sizing opportunities. These recommendations help you match your resource configurations to your actual workload requirements.

#### How right-sizing works

The CCI right-sizing model:
1. **Analyzes historical usage data**: Reviews CPU, memory, network, and storage metrics over time
2. **Identifies usage patterns**: Detects peak usage periods and baseline consumption
3. **Compares against resource allocation**: Evaluates whether your current resource size matches actual needs
4. **Generates recommendations**: Suggests specific instance types or configurations that better match your workload

#### Types of right-sizing recommendations

Right-sizing recommendations may include:
- **Downsize instances**: Reduce instance sizes for consistently underutilized resources
- **Change instance family**: Switch to more cost-effective instance families with similar performance characteristics
- **Modify storage configurations**: Adjust storage types or sizes based on actual I/O patterns
- **Consolidate workloads**: Identify opportunities to combine underutilized resources

#### Potential savings

Each right-sizing recommendation includes:
- Current monthly cost of the resource
- Estimated monthly cost after implementing the recommendation
- Projected monthly savings
- Confidence score based on usage pattern consistency

<Callout variant="important">
Right-sizing recommendations are based on historical usage patterns. Always review recommendations carefully and consider your workload's specific requirements before making changes. Test changes in non-production environments first when possible.
</Callout>

### Savings plan recommendations (CCI ML model)

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides intelligent savings plan recommendations to help you commit to consistent usage in exchange for significant discounts.

#### How savings plan recommendations work

The CCI savings plan model:
1. **Analyzes usage history**: Reviews your compute usage patterns over the past 30-90 days
2. **Identifies stable workloads**: Finds resources with consistent, predictable usage
3. **Calculates optimal commitment levels**: Determines the right amount of compute capacity to commit to
4. **Compares savings options**: Evaluates different savings plan types and terms

#### Types of savings plans

Cloud Cost Intelligence can recommend:
- **Compute Savings Plans**: Flexible plans that apply to any EC2 instance, regardless of region, instance family, or operating system
- **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: Plans that provide deeper discounts for specific instance families in specific regions
- **Commitment terms**: 1-year or 3-year commitment options, with 3-year terms offering higher discounts

#### Understanding your recommendations

Each savings plan recommendation shows:
- **Recommended hourly commitment**: The dollar amount to commit per hour
- **Estimated monthly savings**: Projected cost reduction compared to On-Demand pricing
- **Coverage percentage**: What portion of your usage would be covered by the plan
- **Payback period**: How long it takes for the commitment to pay for itself
- **Break-even analysis**: The minimum usage required to benefit from the commitment

<Callout variant="tip">
Savings plans offer the most value for stable, predictable workloads. Start with conservative commitments and increase over time as you gain confidence in your usage patterns.
</Callout>

## Using recommendations effectively

### Review recommendations regularly

Check your recommendations dashboard weekly to:
- Identify new cost optimization opportunities
- Track which recommendations you've implemented
- Monitor the impact of previous optimizations

### Prioritize high-impact recommendations

Focus on recommendations that offer:
- High potential savings relative to implementation effort
- Low risk to service performance or availability
- Quick wins that build momentum for larger optimizations

### Implement gradually

Start with:
1. **No-risk recommendations**: Removing idle resources with no current usage
2. **Low-risk optimizations**: Right-sizing development and testing environments
3. **Staged production changes**: Testing right-sizing recommendations in non-production first

### Track your savings

Cloud Cost Intelligence helps you track:
- Total potential savings from pending recommendations
- Actual savings achieved from implemented recommendations
- ROI of your cost optimization efforts over time

## Best practices

- **Review before implementing**: Always verify that recommendations align with your workload requirements
- **Test in non-production**: When possible, test right-sizing recommendations in development or staging environments first
- **Monitor after changes**: Watch performance metrics closely after implementing recommendations
- **Start conservatively with commitments**: Begin with smaller savings plan commitments and scale up as you gain confidence
- **Document your decisions**: Keep records of which recommendations you've implemented and why
- **Involve application owners**: Consult with teams who own the resources before making changes

By leveraging recommendations from Trusted Advisor and CCI's ML models, you can systematically identify and capture cost savings while maintaining the performance and reliability your applications require.
