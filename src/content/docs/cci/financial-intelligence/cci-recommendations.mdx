<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides cost optimization recommendations from three sources to help you identify and act on opportunities across your AWS infrastructure. It analyzes your resource usage patterns to provide actionable insights that reduce cloud spending without compromising performance.

<Callout variant="important">
Cost optimization recommendations are currently available for AWS only.
</Callout>

You can use recommendations to:

- Identify oversized resources, underutilized instances, and commitment opportunities
- View potential savings with monthly and annual projections
- Track and prioritize optimization actions (acknowledge, dismiss, or leave pending)

Recommendations come from three sources: AWS Trusted Advisor and two CCI machine learning models (Right-sizing and Savings plan).

## Recommendation sources

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides recommendations from three sources to help you optimize your AWS costs:

### 1. AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor provides cost optimization recommendations directly from AWS.

#### Prerequisites
To use Trusted Advisor recommendations with Cloud Cost Intelligence, you need to set up and configure access to AWS Trusted Advisor in your AWS account.

#### How to navigate
Once configured, Trusted Advisor recommendations appear in the Cloud Cost Intelligence Recommendations page alongside other recommendations.

### 2. Right-sizing (CCI ML model)

Right-sizing is an internal CCI machine learning model that analyzes your resource utilization to identify oversized instances.

#### How it works
The right-sizing model:
- Analyzes actual CPU and memory usage patterns of your resources
- Compares current instance types with actual utilization metrics
- Identifies instances that can be downsized while maintaining performance

#### What recommendations it provides
Right-sizing recommendations suggest specific instance type changes to reduce costs. Each recommendation includes:
- The current and recommended instance types (for example, "Downsize from im4gn.16xlarge to t2.micro")
- Potential monthly and annual cost savings
- Number of occurrences (how many instances match this recommendation)
- Original instance type and configuration
- Actual CPU usage percentage
- Actual memory usage

### 3. Savings plan (CCI ML model)

Savings plan is an internal CCI machine learning model that identifies opportunities to reduce costs through AWS Savings Plans commitments.

#### How it works
The savings plan model:
- Analyzes your historical usage patterns
- Identifies stable, predictable workloads
- Calculates potential savings from committing to usage through AWS Savings Plans

#### What recommendations it provides
Savings plan recommendations help you:
- Commit to consistent usage levels in exchange for discounted rates
- Optimize your AWS spending through strategic commitments
- Balance flexibility with cost savings

## Viewing recommendations

To access your cost optimization recommendations:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Cloud Cost Intelligence**
2. Click **Recommendations** in the left navigation

### Filter recommendations

You can filter recommendations by cloud provider using the filter buttons at the top of the page:
- **All**: View all recommendations across all cloud providers
- **AWS**: View AWS-specific recommendations

## Overview section

The Overview section displays key metrics about your cost optimization opportunities:

- **Total potential**: The total amount you could save across all pending recommendations
- **Acknowledged**: The total savings amount from recommendations you've acknowledged
- **Dismissed**: The total savings amount from recommendations you've dismissed
- **No action taken**: The total savings amount from recommendations that are still pending
- **Annual potential**: The projected annual savings based on current recommendations

## Summary metrics

The Summary section provides a count-based view of your recommendations:

- **Total**: Total number of recommendations available
- **Acknowledged**: Number of recommendations you've acknowledged
- **Pending**: Number of recommendations awaiting action
- **Dismissed**: Number of recommendations you've dismissed

## Viewing recommendation details

Each recommendation card displays:

- **Recommendation title**: Description of the optimization action (for example, "Downsize from im4gn.16xlarge to t2.micro")
- **Source**: The recommendation source (such as CCI ML Model, Trusted Advisor)
- **Service type**: The cloud service (such as AmazonEC2)
- **Monthly savings**: Potential cost savings per month
- **Generated timestamp**: When the recommendation was generated

Click on a recommendation to view detailed information:

- **Potential savings**: Breakdown of savings per month and annually
- **Cloud Provider Account**: The AWS account ID where the resource is located
- **Resource details**: Information about the current resource configuration and recommended changes
- **Number of Occurrences**: How many instances match this recommendation
- **Original Instance Type**: The current instance configuration
- **Actual CPU Usage Percentage**: Current resource utilization metrics
- **Actual Memory Usage**: Current memory utilization

## Taking action on recommendations

For each recommendation, you can take the following actions:

- **Acknowledge**: Mark the recommendation as reviewed and being acted upon. Use this when you plan to implement or are implementing the recommendation.
- **Dismiss**: Remove the recommendation from your active list if it's not applicable to your use case or business requirements.
- **No action (Pending)**: Leave the recommendation in pending status for later review and consideration.

These statuses help you organize and prioritize your cost optimization efforts, and track your progress in the Overview and Summary sections.
