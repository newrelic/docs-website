<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides cost optimization recommendations from two sources to help you identify and act on opportunities across your AWS infrastructure. It analyzes your resource usage patterns using AWS Trusted Advisor and our proprietary Native Intelligence Engine.

<Callout variant="important">
Cost optimization recommendations are currently available for AWS.
</Callout>

You can use recommendations to:

- Identify oversized and underutilized resources, and commitment opportunities
- View potential savings with monthly and annual projections
- Track and prioritize optimization actions (acknowledge, dismiss, or mark as pending)

## Recommendation sources

### AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor provides cost optimization recommendations directly from AWS.

#### Prerequisites
To use **Trusted Advisor** recommendations with Cloud Cost Intelligence, set up and configure access to AWS Trusted Advisor cost insights in your AWS account.

#### How to navigate
Once configured, **Trusted Advisor** recommendations appear in the **Cloud Cost Intelligence Recommendations** page alongside other recommendations.

<Callout variant="important">
Cloud Cost Intelligence verifies **Trusted Advisor** status during the initial AWS account integration. When **Trusted Advisor** is inactive, Cloud Cost Intelligence skips this integration component.

If **Trusted Advisor** is enabled later, Cloud Cost Intelligence will automatically identify the update and synchronize data within seven days of enablement.
</Callout>

### CCI native optimization engine

CCI's native optimization engine analyzes resource utilization and usage history to identify opportunities for right-sizing instances and reducing costs through AWS Savings Plans commitments.

#### How it works

The engine analyzes usage data in two areas:

  - **Right-sizing**: Checks CPU and memory usage, compares current instance types to performance needs, and identifies instances that can be downsized without affecting performance.
  - **Savings plans**: Reviews usage patterns to find consistent workloads and calculates potential savings from AWS Savings Plans commitments.

#### What recommendations it provides

The engine provides recommendations to reduce costs:
  - **Instance type changes**: Specific instance modifications (e.g., Migrate from im4gn.16xlarge to t2.micro) with current configuration, CPU and memory usage, and number of affected instances.
  - **Savings plan commitments**: Recommendations to commit to consistent usage levels for discounted pricing.
  - **Savings projections**: Monthly and annual cost savings for each recommendation.

## Viewing recommendations

To access your cost optimization recommendations:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Cloud Cost Intelligence**
2. Click **Recommendations** in the left navigation.

### Overview section

The Overview section shows key cost optimization metrics:

  - **Total potential**: Total savings across all pending recommendations
  - **Acknowledged**: Savings from acknowledged recommendations
  - **Dismissed**: Savings from dismissed recommendations
  - **No action taken**: Savings from pending recommendations
  - **Annual potential**: Projected annual savings

### Summary metrics

The Summary section shows recommendation counts:

  - **Total**: All available recommendations
  - **Acknowledged**: Acknowledged recommendations
  - **Pending**: Recommendations awaiting action
  - **Dismissed**: Dismissed recommendations

### Viewing recommendation details

Each recommendation card shows:

  - **Recommendation title**: Optimization action (for example, Downsize from im4gn.16xlarge to t2.micro)
  - **Source**: Recommendation source (such as CCI native model, Trusted Advisor)
  - **Service type**: Cloud service (such as AmazonEC2)
  - **Monthly savings**: Potential monthly cost savings
  - **Generated timestamp**: Generation date and time

Click a recommendation to view:

  - **Potential savings**: Monthly and annual savings breakdown
  - **Cloud Provider Account**: AWS account ID
  - **Resource details**: Current configuration and recommended changes
  - **Number of Occurrences**: Matching instance count
  - **Original Instance Type**: Current instance configuration
  - **Actual CPU Usage Percentage**: Current CPU utilization
  - **Actual Memory Usage**: Current memory utilization

### Taking action on recommendations

For each recommendation, you can:

  - **Acknowledge**: Mark as reviewed and being acted upon (use when you plan to implement or are implementing the recommendation)
  - **Dismiss**: Remove from your active list (use when not applicable to your use case or business requirements)
  - **No action (Pending)**: Leave in pending status for later review
  - **Add notes**: Add and save notes for future reference and cross-team collaborations

These statuses help you organize and prioritize your cost optimization efforts, and track your progress in the Overview and Summary sections.
