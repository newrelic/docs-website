<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cloud Cost Intelligence provides cost optimization recommendations from two sources to help you identify and act on opportunities across your AWS infrastructure. It analyzes your resource usage patterns using AWS Trusted Advisor and our proprietary Native Intelligence Engine.

<Callout variant="important">
Cost optimization recommendations are currently available for AWS.
</Callout>

Use recommendations to:

- Identify oversized and underutilized resources and commitment opportunities
- View potential savings with monthly and annual projections
- Track and prioritize optimization actions (acknowledge, dismiss, or mark as pending)

## Recommendation sources

### AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor provides cost optimization recommendations directly from AWS.

#### Prerequisites
To use **Trusted Advisor** recommendations with Cloud Cost Intelligence, set up and configure access to AWS Trusted Advisor cost insights in your AWS account.

#### How to navigate
Once configured, **Trusted Advisor** recommendations appear in the **Cloud Cost Intelligence Recommendations** page alongside other recommendations.

<Callout variant="important">
Cloud Cost Intelligence verifies **Trusted Advisor** status during the initial AWS account integration. When **Trusted Advisor** is inactive, Cloud Cost Intelligence skips this integration component.

If **Trusted Advisor** is enabled later, Cloud Cost Intelligence will automatically identify the update and synchronize data within seven days of enablement.
</Callout>

### CCI native optimization engine

CCI's native optimization engine analyzes resource utilization and usage history to identify opportunities for right-sizing instances and reducing costs through AWS Savings Plans commitments.

#### How it works

The engine analyzes usage data in two areas:

  - **Right-sizing**: Checks CPU and memory usage, compares current instance types to performance needs, and identifies instances that can be downsized without affecting performance.
  - **Savings plans**: Reviews usage patterns to find consistent workloads and calculates potential savings from AWS Savings Plans commitments.

#### What recommendations it provides

The engine provides recommendations to reduce costs:
  - **Instance type changes**: Specific instance modifications (e.g., Migrate from im4gn.16xlarge to t2.micro) with current configuration, CPU and memory usage, and number of affected instances
  - **Savings plan commitments**: Recommendations to commit to consistent usage levels for discounted pricing
  - **Savings projections**: Monthly and annual cost savings for each recommendation
