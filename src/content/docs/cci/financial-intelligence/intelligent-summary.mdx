The Intelligent summary page helps you to:

  - **View spending**: Monitor spending data across your cloud services, teams, and time periods, including usage metrics and cost allocation.
  - **Anticipate costs**: Access real-time estimates and detailed breakdowns to anticipate potential cost overruns.
  - **Optimize costs**: Identify top cost variances and untagged resources.
  - **Gain customized insights**: Tailor your analysis by viewing costs through multiple filters, such as account, application, or team.

## Cost types

View your cloud expenditures by different cost types. Each type provides a distinct perspective on your expenses:
