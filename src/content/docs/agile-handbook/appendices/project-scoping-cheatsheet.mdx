We use this cheatsheet to help us scope projects in a consistent way.

## What is this [#what_is_this]

* Who is the primary audience?
* Any docs deliverables you already have in mind?

## Dates [#dates]

* What are you working on right now?
* When does this "release" (limited preview, public preview, or general availability)?
* If limited preview, how many customers and do they need docs?

## Scope [#scope]

* Who will write first drafts?
* Do you need any templates?
* Does this need a liaison?

## Resources [#resources]
