<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  If you have questions or feedback, or if you need help during the preview of the .NET agent's <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor, send an email to [dotnet-li-editor-beta@newrelic.com](mailto:dotnet-li-editor-beta@newrelic.com).

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Our <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor allows .NET app users to implement custom instrumentation from the New Relic user interface without requiring a restart of the instrumented application. This editor:

* Allows authorized users to edit custom instrumentation from the New Relic UI instead of the local XML files.
* Validates against the custom instrumentation schema.
* Provides an option for customers who do not have access to either the application code or hosts on which their applications execute.

## Requirements

To use the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor, you must meet the following requirements:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        <DNT>
          **Requirements**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **Comments**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Agent
      </td>

      <td>
        .NET agent version 7.0.2 or higher
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [Account role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles#roles)
      </td>

      <td>
        Owner or Admin
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Security
      </td>

      <td>
        Users of [high-security mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode) cannot use the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor to update instrumentation of their app.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Define custom instrumentation [#defining]

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select a .NET app) > Settings > Instrumentation:**</DNT> The <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor provides an easy way to view or edit your custom instrumentation in the UI. This XML example shows the assembly name, class name, and method name.

<Callout variant="important">
  Deploying live instrumentation causes a brief period of higher overhead. This can noticeably slow application requests for several seconds.
</Callout>

To use the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM**</DNT>. Find your app, then click <DNT>**Settings > Instrumentation**</DNT>.
2. Use the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor to provide XML using the same syntax as described for [editing local .xml instrumentation files](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/create-transactions-xml-net) and [adding instrumentation detail.](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/add-detail-transactions-xml-net) Use any of these options from the UI:

   * Type in XML code directly.
   * Copy the code and paste it in from a clipboard.
   * Click <DNT>**Download Sample XML**</DNT> to create a sample instrumentation file as a starting point.
   * Upload an .xml file by selecting <DNT>**Choose file**</DNT>. For an example, see [Example MyInstrumentation.xml](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/add-detail-transactions-xml-net#sample).
3. The <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor validates your XML code as you type. To perform XML validation outside of the editor, select <DNT>**Download XSD**</DNT>, and use the XSD file with your favorite XML validation tool to diagnose problems.
4. To deploy the changes, select <DNT>**Submit**</DNT>.

## View instrumentation results [#view]

The .NET agent will begin the new instrumentation within a few [harvest cycles](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#harvest-cycle) (typically a few minutes). The <DNT>**Current instrumentation**</DNT> section of the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> UI will show the status of applied changes.

The XML from the <DNT>**Instrumentation**</DNT> editor is combined with the XML that exists in the local instrumentation files on the machine running the agent. The agent periodically looks for changes in the final (combined) XML and picks them up dynamically, without requiring a restart of the agent or application.
