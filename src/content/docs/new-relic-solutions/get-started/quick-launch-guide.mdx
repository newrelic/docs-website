This guide helps you set up New Relic quickly. 

## Read before you start [#before-start]

This guide walks you through a quick and simple setup aimed at letting you use some of the most important and powerful New Relic features. It'll be most useful for small organizations with few users, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic before doing a more in-depth, at-scale rollout. 

Other options for getting started:

* For more in-depth guidance on setting up New Relic, see the [Implementation guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro).
* If you're confident you know what tools you want to install, see [Install New Relic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/install-new-relic#what). You can also add more solutions after you complete this guide.

      <td>
        If your organization doesn't already have a New Relic account, [sign up here](https://newrelic.com/signup). No credit card needed and you get 100 GBs of data per month for free. [Learn more about estimating costs.](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost) 

        Does your organization already have New Relic but you're just adding a new team or project? See [Add a new account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

        Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) auto-discovers your environment, and walks you through a recommended setup. When the infrastructure agent and APM agent are installed, log data is usually also reported (although sometimes manual configuration is necessary). 

        [Watch a video of using the guided install.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-RQIkBJOA).
        
        If you prefer or require a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the options below.

          >

**Infrastructure agent**

Install the infrastructure agent to get host data. Choose the most relevant option:
  * Docker: [Install on a Docker container](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure-monitoring)
  * Kubernetes: 
    * [Install agent via Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm)
    * [Use our Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) to get telemetry data and dashboards
  * All else: [Install the agent on a host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/#install) 

**Cloud platforms**

Connect your cloud platforms to get data from your cloud services:

* Install cloud platforms: [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), [GCP](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations)

**Infrastructure services**

Install [on-host integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/?category=infrastructure-and-os) for popular infrastructure-related services like MySQL, Apache, Cassandra, NGINX, Kafka, and more. 

**Application data** 

Our main options for instrumenting applications: 
* [Install a language-specific APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm)
* [OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction)

        **Step 3. Check out some dashboards**
      </td>

Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages. If you don't see that, revisit the install instructions or see [Not seeing data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data). 

Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more: 
* Video: [An intro to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) (2:20)
* [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
* [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities)
* [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
* [Distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui) 
* [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)

Want to build your own dashboards? To build charts, you'll need to learn to [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).

You're now ready to add the rest of your team to New Relic. Use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) to add users. To learn about the different types of users, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). See [our tutorial on adding users and managing user access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial).
