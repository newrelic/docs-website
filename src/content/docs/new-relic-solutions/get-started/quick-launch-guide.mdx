This guide walks you through a recommended path for setting up New Relic quickly. 

## Before you start [#before-start]

Some important points before you start: 

* There are many ways to set up New Relic, depending on your system and your goals. This guide walks you through a quick setup that many customers find useful. 
* This guide will tend to be most useful for smaller organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic before doing a more in-depth, at-scale rollout.
* If you'd like to instead start adding tools for some specific technologies, see [Install New Relic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/install-new-relic#what). You can also add some after you complete this guide.

        **Step 1. Sign up for New Relic**
      </td>      
      <td>
        If your organization doesn't already have a New Relic account, [sign up here](https://newrelic.com/signup). No credit card needed and you get 100 GBs of data per month for free. [Learn more about estimating costs.](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost) 

        Does your organization already have New Relic but you're just adding a new team or project? See [Add a new account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

        Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) auto-discovers your environment, and walks you through a recommended setup. When the infrastructure agent and APM agent are installed, log data is usually also reported (although sometimes manual configuration is necessary). 

        [Watch a video of using the guided install.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-RQIkBJOA).
        
        If you prefer or require a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the options below.

          >

**Infrastructure agent**

Install the infrastructure agent to get host data. Choose the most relevant option:
  * Docker: [Install on a Docker container](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure-monitoring)
  * Kubernetes: 
    * [Install agent via Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm)
    * [Use our Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) to get telemetry data and dashboards
  * All else: [Install the agent on a host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/#install) 

**Cloud platforms**

Connect your cloud platforms to get data from your cloud services:

* Install cloud platforms: [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), [GCP](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations)

**Infrastructure services**

Install [on-host integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/?category=infrastructure-and-os) for popular infrastructure-related services like MySQL, Apache, Cassandra, NGINX, Kafka, and more. 

**Application data** 

Our main options for instrumenting applications: 
* [Install a language-specific APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm)
* [OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction)

        **Step 3. Check out some dashboards**
      </td>

Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages. If you don't see that, revisit the install instructions or see [Not seeing data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data). 

Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more: 
* Video: [An intro to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) (2:20)
* [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
* [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities)
* [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
* [Distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui) 
* [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)

Want to build your own dashboards? To build charts, you'll need to learn to [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).

You're now ready to add the rest of your team to New Relic. Use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) to add users. To learn about the different types of users, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).
