Whether you're considering New Relic or you're already using our capabilities, this glossary of common terminology can help. And if you don't already have a New Relic account, don't hesitate to sign up at [newrelic.com/signup](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever!

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="account"
    title="account"
  >
    A New Relic organization can have one or more accounts. An account can be considered a workspace: a space to monitor or analyze data relating to a specific project or a specific team. Each account has its own account ID, and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls. For more on why you'd create an account, see [Account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

    We have two different user models, which define how accounts relate to the larger organization structure and to the organization's users. For more on our two user models and their separate set of docs, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-family"
    title="account family"
  >
    A New Relic organization can have one or more [accounts](#account).

    An "account family" refers to a parent account and the children accounts under it. For users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models), "account family" is synonymous with "organization": it's the group of related accounts in an organization. For our original user model, things are a little more complex: see [Original account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-dropdown"
    title="account dropdown"
  >
    The **account dropdown** is our older, deprecated name for the [user menu](#user-menu). 

    If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the [account switcher](#account-switcher).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-switcher"
    title="account switcher"
  >
    <img
      title="The account switcher"
      alt="The account switcher lets you switch between accounts."
      src={accountsAccountSwitcher}
    />

    If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of the [New Relic home page](https://one.newrelic.com) and some other entity list views.

    For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data).

    To find account settings, use the [user menu](#user-menu).

  <Collapser
    id="agent"
    title="agent"
  >
    A New Relic agent is an installable piece of software that integrates with multiple types of technologies (for example, web frameworks, operating systems, and types of databases) and reports data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. We have APM agents, an infrastructure agent, a browser monitoring agent, and mobile monitoring agents. The various technologies that our agents integrate with are just some of [our many integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

    For more information, see:

    * [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability)
    * [Install agents](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agent-api"
    title="agent API"
  >
    Some New Relic agents have **agent APIs** that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent.

    Here are some agent API docs:

    **APM agents:**

    * [Go agent API](/docs/agents/go-agent/api-guides/guide-using-go-agent-api)

    * [Java agent API](/docs/java/java-agent-api)

    * [.NET agent API](/docs/dotnet/the-net-agent-api)

    * [Node.js agent API](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-transaction-naming-api)

    * [PHP agent API](/docs/php/the-php-api)

    * [Ruby agent API](/docs/ruby/ruby-agent-api)

    * [Python agent API](/docs/python/python-agent-public-apis)

    **Browser agent:**

    * [Browser agent API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api)

    **Mobile agents:**

    * [iOS SDK API](/docs/mobile-apps/ios-api)

    * [Android SDK API](/docs/mobile-apps/android-api)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregated-metrics"
    title="aggregated metrics"
  >
    **Aggregated metric** data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your [subscription level](https://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing). For more information, see the documentation about [data retention](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-delay"
    title="aggregation delay"
  >
    The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW `aggreation_method` types.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-function"
    title="aggregation function"
  >
    You can use NRQL query [functions](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions), such as `sum()`, `average()`, or `latest()` to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-method"
    title="aggregation method"
  >
    New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The `aggregation_method` is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified:

    * `EVENT_FLOW`: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics)

    * `CADENCE`: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the `aggregation_delay` setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. `aggregation_delay` is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts.

    * `EVENT_TIMER`: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the `aggregation_timer` setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The `aggregation_timer` is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the `aggregation_timer` reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation_timer"
    title="aggregation timer"
  >
    The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using `EVENT_TIMER` `aggregation_method` type.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-window"
    title="aggregation window"
  >
    Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable.

    Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="AI"
    title="AI"
  >
  This may refer to an acronym for [applied intelligence](#applied-intelligence). 
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert"
    title="alert"
  >
    An **alert** communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerting-new-relic).

    For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-condition"
    title="alert condition"
  >
    An **alert condition** (or **condition**), identified by its unique numeric `condition_id`, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the [threshold](#alert-threshold) that is set for a [metric timeslice](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#timeslice-data) or a [custom metric](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-custom-metrics-alert-condition) over time on a chosen [target](#alert-target).

    For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-evaluation"
    title="alert evaluation"
  >
    Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering.

    The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it.

    If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-policy"
    title="alert policy"
  >
    A collection of one or more [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions), one or more [notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts), and an [**Incident preference**](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) setting.

    If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the **Incident preference** setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy.

    For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="anomaly"
    title="anomaly"
  >
  When a service or application behaves abnormally, applied intelligence flags it as an anomaly. You can find anomalies in the activity feeds throughout New Relic. You can also create custom configurations to get notifications or track anomalies in other types of entities, like hosts and mobile apps.

  For more information, see [proactive detection] (/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex"
    title="apdex"
  >
    **Apdex** is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as **Satisfied**, **Tolerated**, or **Frustrated**, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score.

    For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex_f"
    title="apdex_f"
  >
    The response time above which a transaction are rated **frustrating**. Defaults to four times `apdex_t`.

    * Requests that complete in less than `apdex_t` are rated **satisfied**.
    * Requests that take longer than `apdex_t`, but less than four times `apdex_t` (`apdex_f`), are **tolerated**.
    * Any requests that take longer than `apdex_f` are rated **frustrating**.

    For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex_t"
    title="apdex_t"
  >
    The response time above which a transaction is considered **tolerable**. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can [change this in your Apdex settings](/docs/site/changing-your-apdex-settings).

    * Requests that complete in less than `apdex_t` are rated **satisfied**.
    * Requests that take more than `apdex_t`, but less than `apdex_f`, are **tolerated**.
    * Any requests that take longer than `apdex_f` are rated **frustrating**.

    For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api"
    title="API (application programming interface)"
  >
    New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the [introduction to New Relic's APIs](/docs/apis).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nr-apm"
    title="APM"
  >
    New Relic's [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm) (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several [programming languages](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#apm-install).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application"
    title="application"
  >
    For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application_id"
    title="application ID"
  >
    Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique **application ID**, often shortened to **app ID**. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried.

    For how to determine this, see [Find app ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/app-id-other-product-ids).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application-name"
    title="application name"
  >
    The name that New Relic combines with your <LicenseKey/> to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see [Name your application](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="applied-intelligence"
    title="Applied intelligence"
  >
    Applied intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it's a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies.

    Applied intelligence includes alerts, incident intelligence, and proactive detection.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="attribute"
    title="attribute"
  >
    **Attributes** are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by [querying or searching via the UI](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) or by using the [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary).

    Examples:

    * APM reports a `Transaction` event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a `duration` attribute, which might have a value of `.002`.
    * Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a `ProcessSample` event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a `cpuSystemPercent` attribute, which might have a value of `.01`.
    * Our Telemetry SDK reports a `Metric` data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like `metricName` and `newrelic.source`.

    Some New Relic tools allow you to report [custom attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/collecting-custom-attributes) to enhance your monitoring.

    For more information about attributes in APM, see [Agent attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/agent-attributes).

    New Relic offers **cloud-based integrations** with providers such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), and [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collector"
    title="collector"
  >
    The component that collects data from New Relic [agents](#agent) running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the **collectors** are centrally located in New Relic's data center.

    In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach [New Relic's domains and IP addresses](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks). (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) and by our various REST APIs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cli"
    title="Command line interface (CLI)"

  >
    See [alert condition](#alert-condition).
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="conditions"
    title="conditions"
  >
Use alert conditions to define when and why your team will be notified if your entities aren't working the way you want. With conditions, you establish the criteria for notifications about lag time, code errors, Apdex scores, high CPU usage, and more. 

For more information, see [incidents] (/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident).
  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="container"
    title="container"
  >
  A container is a standard unit of software that carries all the necessary pieces of code and all of its dependencies in order for your application to run smoothly across a variety of computing environments.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cpm"
    title="CPM (calls per minute)"
  >
    The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as [RPM (requests per minute)](#rpm).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cpu_burn"
    title="CPU burn"
  >
    The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-attribute"
    title="custom attribute"
  >
    A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see [custom attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/collecting-custom-attributes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-dashboard"
    title="custom dashboard"
  >
    A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-event"
    title="custom event"
  >
    An [event](#event), in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached [attributes](#attribute). New Relic reports default event types, like `Transaction` and `TransactionError`. You can also create your own events. Events can be [queried](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), and are used in some other features.

    You can generate custom events with [APM agents](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events-new-relic-apm-agents), the [browser monitoring agent](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-via-new-relic-browser), the [mobile monitoring agents](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-events/insert-custom-events-attributes-mobile-data), and via the [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api). Alternatively, you can add [custom attributes](#custom-attribute) to some existing default New Relic events.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-instrumentation"
    title="custom instrumentation"
  >
    **Custom instrumentation** allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your [framework](#framework) is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see [Custom instrumentation](/docs/features/custom-instrumentation).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-metric"
    title="custom metric"
  >
    [Metric timeslice data](#metric) that is manually recorded via an API call. **Custom metrics** allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with `Custom/`. For more information, see [Custom metrics](/docs/features/custom-metrics).

    Not to be confused with [custom instrumentation data](#custom-instrumentation-data).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data-collector"
    title="data collector"
  >
    See [collector](#collector).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data-explorer"
    title="metrics and events"
  >
    Use metrics and events to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience.

    For more on using metrics and events, see [Introduction to metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="degradation-period"
    title="degradation period"
  >
    When a data source enters a violating state, a **degradation period** of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition:

    * If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open.
    * If your alert condition threshold is configured as `at least once in`, the degradation period always lasts a single minute.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dependencies"
    title="dependencies"
  >
  A dependency is the code that your application depends on in order to function. New Relic provides a list of  all the applications, services, databases, and hosts we can tell are connected to an entity. On the **Dependencies** UI page, you can find an entity's upstream and downstream dependencies, and the paths to explore them. 
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="destinations"
    title="destinations"
  >
  Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

  Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dimensional-metric"
    title="dimensional metric"
  >
    A **dimensional metric** is a metric that has multiple [attributes](#attribute), also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the [`Metric` data type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics). For more on other metric data types, see [Metric data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics).

    In New Relic, an **entity** is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers.

    You can identify one or more entities to be [targets for alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition). In the [alerts API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts), the entity being monitored is identified with an `entity_id`.

  <Collapser
    id="event"
    title="event"

   In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, changing a server setting is an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse.

    Some events generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event.

    At New Relic, an **exporter** is a type of [integration](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/) that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see [Exporters](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic#external-data), or search our [integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/).

  <Collapser
    id="external-service"
    title="external service"

    An external service is a [service](#service) that is out-of-process relative to a service that is instrumented and reporting data to New Relic. An external service calls or is called by that instrumented service.
    
    In most places in the New Relic UI, external services are _uninstrumented_ services that do not report telemetry themselves to New Relic, but are  observed from the outside using the data that instrumented services report about incoming or outgoing calls. For example, an external service named "api.stripe.com" is not instrumented and reporting data to New Relic itself, but is known to New Relic when a service instrumented with the New Relic agent makes an HTTP request to the hostname api.stripe.com.

    A facet helps your team compare information that has many variables. You can query New Relic data in NRQL and use facets to segment the displayed data. For example, if you want to know where your CPU data is being used, you can segment your CPU data by the hostname facet:

    ```SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample FACET hostname```

    [New Relic Flex](/docs/introduction-new-relics-flex-integration) is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure [integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations). With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal.

    It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills.

  <Collapser
    id="framework"
    title="framework"

    A **framework** is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions.

    Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar [(generally green, yellow, red, or gray)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/identifying-entities-without-alert-policies) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations.

    In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions:

    * Our REST API (v2) uses `orange` instead of `yellow` for the [application's health and reporting status](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/application-reporting-health-status-v2).
    * [Service maps](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/service-maps) use different [criteria](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/service-maps#identify-external-issues) for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API).

    At New Relic, a **host** means one of the following:

    * A **physical machine** is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on.
    * A **virtual machine** (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU.

    id="organization"
    title="organization"
  >
    At New Relic, "organization" can refer to one or more concepts:

    * We sometimes use "organization" in a general way to refer to a business or non-profit entity.
    * For New Relic account management purposes, a "New Relic organization" refers to all the assets and data belonging to a New Relic customer (for example, their accounts, their users, and their data). For more about this concept, see [Organization and account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

    For accounts on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/transition-guide-new-pricing-plan), this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see [Users](/docs/subscriptions/users-and-roles).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="page-load-timing"
    title="page load timing"
  >
    With **page load timing**, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's [application agents](#agent) dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points:

    * **Navigation start**: The user initiates the transaction.
    * **First byte**: The browser receives the requested page.
    * **DOM ready**: The browser has finished parsing DOM.
    * **Page ready**: Page loading is complete.

    Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see [Page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process).

    New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations that had users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models), but is still relevant for some features for organizations with users on our newer user model. The first account created in a New Relic organization is essentially the parent account: one impact of this is that that account is where the usage and billing data is reported to. 
    
    [Learn more about account structure.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure)

    Parent accounts were previously referred to as "master accounts", and child accounts were previously referred to as "sub-accounts".

    id="root-span"
    title="root span"
  >
    For [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), the **root span** is the first [span](#span) in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it.

    However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace.

    The term **RPM** usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as [CPM](#cpm) (calls per minute).

    Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain **RPM** in the URL; for example, `https://rpm.newrelic.com`. This language use [originally referred to **Rails performance management**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5252561/rails-new-relic-what-does-rpm-mean) because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications.

    A **target** is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been [identified in an alert condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition). When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's [Incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) setting, alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also [**entity**](#entity).

    id="telemetry"
    title="telemetry"
  >
    Basically, when you're using New Relic, you're gathering telemetry data. With New Relic, you monitor your systems and collect data in the form of metrics, events, logs, and traces. New Relic then stores that collected data in our servers, which you can access and analyze through your dashboards.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-threshold"
    title="thresholds"
  >
    **Thresholds** are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example:

    * Passing a certain value for at least x minutes
    * Passing a certain value only once in x minutes

    While the data source passes a certain value, a [degradation period](#degradation-period) starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a [recovery period](#recovery-period) starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings.

    Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's [health status](#health-status) indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open.

    For more information, see [Define thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert). For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic alerts concepts, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).

    * Browser: page views per minute (PPM)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tier"
    title="tier"
  >
    A **tier** can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example:

    * In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your [app's main **Overview** chart](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc.
    * In New Relic [labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/labels-categories-organize-your-apps-servers), `TIER` can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers.

    "Tier" may sometimes be used to refer to our [pricing editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing).
