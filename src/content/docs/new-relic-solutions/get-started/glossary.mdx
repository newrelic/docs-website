Whether you're considering New Relic or you're already using our capabilities, this glossary of common terminology can help. And if you're looking to get started, see [Get started with New Relic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/intro-new-relic).

    id="account"
    title="account"
  >
    A New Relic organization can have one or more accounts. An account can be considered a workspace: a space to monitor or analyze data relating to a specific project or a specific team. Each account has its own account ID, and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls. For more on why you'd create an account, see [Account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

    The word "account" is sometimes used in a more general industry sense. For example, it is sometimes used to refer to a New Relic organization, or a New Relic customer, or to a New Relic user's user record. In technical terms, though, at New Relic an account refers to an account with an account ID.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-family"
    title="account family"
  >
    A New Relic organization can have one or more [accounts](#account).

    An "account family" refers to a parent account and the children accounts under it: in other words, a group of related accounts tied together by billing.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="account-switcher"

      title="The account switcher"
      alt="The account switcher lets you switch between accounts."
      src="/images/accounts_screenshot-crop_account-switcher.webp"
    />

    If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account [organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. It's located in the top right of the [New Relic home page](https://one.newrelic.com) and some other entity list views.

    For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data).

    To find account settings, use the [user menu](#user-menu).

  <Collapser
    id="agent"
    title="agent"
  >
    A New Relic agent is an installable piece of software that integrates with multiple types of technologies (for example, web frameworks, operating systems, and types of databases) and reports data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. We have <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents, an infrastructure agent, a <InlinePopover type="browser"/> agent, and mobile monitoring agents. The various technologies that our agents integrate with are just some of [our many integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

    For more information, see:

    * [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability)
    * [Install agents](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-delay"
    title="aggregation delay"
  >
    For our [alerting feature](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method), this refers to the length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using `aggregation_method` types `CADENCE` or `EVENT_FLOW`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-function"
    title="aggregation function"
  >
    In the context of NRQL alerts, you can use [NRQL functions](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions), such as `sum()`, `average()`, or `latest()` to choose how the data points in an [aggregation window](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method) should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-method"
    title="aggregation method"
  >
    In the context of New Relic alerts, we aggregate data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The [aggregation_method](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method) is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified:

    * `EVENT_FLOW`: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics)

    * `CADENCE`: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the `aggregation_delay` setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. `aggregation_delay` is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts.

    * `EVENT_TIMER`: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the `aggregation_timer` setting. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point's timestamp). The `aggregation_timer` is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the `aggregation_timer` reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation_timer"
    title="aggregation timer"
  >
    In the context of [New Relic alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview), this is the length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using `EVENT_TIMER` `aggregation_method` type.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="aggregation-window"
    title="aggregation window"
  >
    In the context of [New Relic <InlinePopover type="alerts"/>](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview), streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable.

    Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false incidents when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="AI"
    title="AI"
  >
    AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to computer systems that can understand, learn, and perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. At New Relic, when we say AI, we mean the layer of your environment that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a response (or make a decision) based on end-user prompts.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert"
    title="alert"
  >
    An <DNT>**alert**</DNT> communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerting-new-relic).

    For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-condition"
    title="alert condition"
  >
    An <DNT>**alert condition**</DNT> (or <DNT>**condition**</DNT>), identified by its unique numeric `condition_id`, contains the criteria for creating an incident. The condition includes the [threshold](#alert-threshold) that is set for a [metric timeslice](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#timeslice-data) or a [custom metric](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-custom-metrics-alert-condition) over time on a chosen [target](#alert-target).

    For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-evaluation"
    title="alert evaluation"
  >
    In the context of alerts, streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is breaching or recovering.

    The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it.

    If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-policy"
    title="alert policy"
  >
    In the context of alerts, an alert policy is a collection of one or more [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions), one or more [notification channels](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-channels/), and an [<DNT>**Incident preference**</DNT>](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) setting.

    A condition contained within a policy may open an incident depending on the [incident preference settings](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/specify-when-alerts-create-incidents). In this case, all channels attached to the policy will generate notifications.

    For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="anomaly"
    title="anomaly"
  >
    When a service or application behaves abnormally, New Relic's alerting features flag it as an anomaly. You can find anomalies in the activity feeds throughout New Relic. You can also create custom configurations to get notifications or track anomalies in other types of entities, like hosts and mobile apps.

    For more information, see [anomaly detection] \(/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex"
    title="apdex"
  >
    <DNT>**Apdex**</DNT> is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as <DNT>**Satisfied**</DNT>, <DNT>**Tolerated**</DNT>, or <DNT>**Frustrated**</DNT>, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score.

    For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex_f"
    title="apdex_f"
  >
    The response time above which a transaction are rated <DNT>**frustrating**</DNT>. Defaults to four times `apdex_t`.

    * Requests that complete in less than `apdex_t` are rated <DNT>**satisfied**</DNT>.
    * Requests that take longer than `apdex_t`, but less than four times `apdex_t` (`apdex_f`), are <DNT>**tolerated**</DNT>.
    * Any requests that take longer than `apdex_f` are rated <DNT>**frustrating**</DNT>.

      For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apdex_t"
    title="apdex_t"
  >
    The response time above which a transaction is considered <DNT>**tolerable**</DNT>. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can [change this in your Apdex settings](/docs/site/changing-your-apdex-settings).

    * Requests that complete in less than `apdex_t` are rated <DNT>**satisfied**</DNT>.
    * Requests that take more than `apdex_t`, but less than `apdex_f`, are <DNT>**tolerated**</DNT>.
    * Any requests that take longer than `apdex_f` are rated <DNT>**frustrating**</DNT>.

      For more information, see [Apdex: Measure user satisfaction](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api"
    title="API (application programming interface)"
  >
    New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the [introduction to New Relic APIs](/docs/apis).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nr-apm"
    title="APM"
  >
    New Relic [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm) (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. <InlinePopover type="apm"/> supports apps using several [programming languages](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#apm-install).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application"
    title="application"
  >
    For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application_id"
    title="application ID"
  >
    Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique <DNT>**application ID**</DNT>, often shortened to <DNT>**app ID**</DNT>. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried.

    For how to determine this, see [Find app ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/app-id-other-product-ids).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="application-name"
    title="application name"
  >
    The name that New Relic combines with your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see [Name your application](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="attribute"
    title="attribute"
  >
    <DNT>**Attributes**</DNT> are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by [querying or searching via the UI](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) or by using the [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary).

    Examples:

    * APM reports a `Transaction` event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a `duration` attribute, which might have a value of `.002`.
    * Our infrastructure monitoring reports a `ProcessSample` event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a `cpuSystemPercent` attribute, which might have a value of `.01`.
    * Our Telemetry SDK reports a `Metric` data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like `metricName` and `newrelic.source`.

      Some New Relic tools allow you to report [custom attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/collecting-custom-attributes) to enhance your monitoring.

      For more information about attributes in APM, see [Agent attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/agent-attributes).

    New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), and [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collector"
    title="collector"
  >
    The component that collects data from New Relic [agents](#agent) running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in our data center.

    In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach [New Relic domains and IP addresses](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks). (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) and by our various REST APIs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cli"
    title="command line interface (CLI)"
  >
    Our [command line interface](/docs/new-relic-solutions/build-nr-ui/newrelic-cli) (CLI) is a tool that lets you manage New Relic, including managing and controlling your use of New Relic at scale.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="condition_id"
    title="condition ID"
  >
    See [alert condition](#alert-condition).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="conditions"
    title="conditions"
  >
    Use alert conditions to define when and why your team will be notified if your entities aren't working the way you want. With conditions, you establish the criteria for notifications about lag time, code errors, Apdex scores, high CPU usage, and more.

    For more information, see [incidents](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="container"
    title="container"
  >
    A container is a standard unit of software that carries all the necessary pieces of code and all of its dependencies in order for your application to run smoothly across a variety of computing environments.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cpm"
    title="CPM (calls per minute)"
  >
    The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as [RPM (requests per minute)](#rpm).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="cpu_burn"
    title="CPU burn"
  >
    The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-attribute"
    title="custom attribute"
  >
    A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see [custom attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/collecting-custom-attributes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-dashboard"
    title="custom dashboard"
  >
    A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-event"
    title="custom event"
  >
    An [event](#event), in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached [attributes](#attribute). New Relic reports default event types, like `Transaction` and `TransactionError`. You can also create your own events. Events can be [queried](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), and are used in some other features.

    You can generate custom events with [APM agents](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events-new-relic-apm-agents), the [browser monitoring agent](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-via-new-relic-browser), the [mobile monitoring agents](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-events/insert-custom-events-attributes-mobile-data), and via the [Event API](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api). Alternatively, you can add [custom attributes](#custom-attribute) to some existing default New Relic events.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-instrumentation"
    title="custom instrumentation"
  >
    <DNT>**Custom instrumentation**</DNT> allows you to extend New Relic monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your [framework](#framework) is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see [Custom instrumentation](/docs/features/custom-instrumentation).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-metric"
    title="custom metric"
  >
    [Metric timeslice data](#metric) that is manually recorded via an API call. <DNT>**Custom metrics**</DNT> allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with `Custom/`. For more information, see [Custom metrics](/docs/features/custom-metrics).

    Not to be confused with [custom instrumentation data](#custom-instrumentation-data).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data-collector"
    title="data collector"
  >
    See [collector](#collector).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data-explorer"
    title="metrics and events"
  >
    In the <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT> UI, you can access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience.

    For more on this, see [Introduction to metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="degradation-period"
    title="degradation period"
  >
    In the context of alerting, when a data source enters a breaching state, a <DNT>**degradation period**</DNT> of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. An incident will open if the source stays in a breaching state for the entire degradation period. In addition:

    * If the data source enters a non-breaching state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and an incident does not open.
    * If your alert condition threshold is configured as `at least once in`, the degradation period always lasts a single minute.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dependencies"
    title="dependencies"
  >
    A dependency is the code that your application depends on in order to function. New Relic provides a list of all the applications, services, databases, and hosts we can tell are connected to an entity. On the [<DNT>**Dependencies**</DNT> UI page](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/explore-downstream-dependencies-new-relic-one), you can find an entity's upstream and downstream dependencies, and the paths to explore them.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="destinations"
    title="destinations"
  >
    In the context of alerting, [destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations) are where we send notifications about your data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

    Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dimensional-metric"
    title="dimensional metric"
  >
    A <DNT>**dimensional metric**</DNT> is a metric that has multiple [attributes](#attribute), also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the [`Metric` data type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics). For more on other metric data types, see [Metric data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="distributed_tracing_and_trace_groups"
    title="distributed tracing"
  >
    Distributed tracing is a method of monitoring requests as they flow through various cloud environments. Distributed tracing tracks a request by tagging it with a unique identifier. This allows your team to have a real-time understanding of the interactions taking place within your entities.

    In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, changing a server setting is an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse.

    Some events generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event.
    To learn how New Relic uses events, see [New Relic data types](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).

    title="external service"

    An external service is a [service](#service) that is out-of-process relative to a service that is instrumented and reporting data to New Relic. An external service calls or is called by that instrumented service.

    In most places in the New Relic UI, external services are _uninstrumented_ services that do not report telemetry themselves to New Relic, but are observed from the outside using the data that instrumented services report about incoming or outgoing calls. For example, an external service named `api.stripe.com` is not instrumented and reporting data to New Relic itself, but is known to New Relic when a service instrumented with the New Relic agent makes an HTTP request to the hostname `api.stripe.com`.

    A facet helps your team compare information that has many variables. You can query New Relic data in NRQL and use facets to segment the displayed data. For example, if you want to know where your CPU data is being used, you can segment your CPU data by the hostname facet:

With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal.

    It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills.

    A <DNT>**framework**</DNT> is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions.

    * [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api) for reporting custom events

    * [Query and chart data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder)

      For historical reasons, the word "Insights" is still used in some places. For example:

    * For New Relic organizations on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention.

    * Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent [`custom_insights_events` configuration](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Custom_Events).

    For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see [synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics). Synthetic monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world.

    In the context of alerting, the signal is the stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on.  You use a NRQL query to define a signal.

    A unique signal is generated when the condition sees a unique stream of data that matches the NRQL query.  Queries can contain a FACET clause in order for a single condition to generate multiple discrete signals; one for each matching facet.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alert-threshold"
    title="thresholds"

    <DNT>**Thresholds**</DNT> are alert condition settings that define an incident. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger an incident and the time-related settings that define an incident; for example:

    * Passing a certain value for at least x minutes
    * Passing a certain value only once in x minutes

      While the data source passes a certain value, a [degradation period](#degradation-period) starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a [recovery period](#recovery-period) starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings.

      Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's [health status](#health-status) indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and an incident will open.

      For more information, see [Define thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert).

  <Collapser
    id="tier"
    title="tier"

    A <DNT>**tier**</DNT> can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example:

    * In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your [app's main <DNT>**Overview**</DNT> chart](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc.
    * In New Relic [labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/labels-categories-organize-your-apps-servers), `TIER` can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, frontend and backend tiers.
