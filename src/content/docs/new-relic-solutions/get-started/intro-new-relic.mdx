New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system, analyze that data efficiently, and respond to incidents before they become problems. As extensive as the capabilities of New Relic are, you can get started with the platform by following a three-step procedure.

Need some inspiration first? Check out this intro video.

Otherwise, let's get you started:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Sign up for New Relic if you haven't already.

    <InlineSignup/>

    Does your organization already have New Relic but you're just adding a new team or project? See [Add a new account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Ingest some data

    Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) auto-discovers your environment, and walks you through a recommended setup. When the infrastructure agent and <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent are installed, log data is usually also reported (although sometimes manual configuration is necessary).

    [Watch a video of using the guided install.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-RQIkBJOA).

    ### Manual installation:

    If you prefer or require a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the options below.

We offer a fast, scalable <InlinePopover type="logs" /> platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place.

* Enable log management with [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context), our [infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), or other [log forwarding solutions](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/).
* Explore relevant [log data across your platform](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context#response-time-example), including errors, distributed traces, hosts, and more.
* Use our [logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/) to find meaninful patterns in your logs, attributes, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Not only that, you can add alerts conditions, query your log data, and create <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> to share with colleagues.

Understanding “Is it the network?” begins with collecting network telemetry and using the power of the New Relic platform to navigate and explore each unique telemetry type.

Don't know where to start? Check out the [guided deployment wizard](https://one.newrelic.com/network-performance-monitoring).

Already know what telemetry you want to add? Start [here](https://onenr.io/0VjYDqkZ3R0) with Instant Observability.

[Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics) allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to make sure your content is fully functional. Send scripted browser tests to your site from locations all around the world to verify your content is always up, everywhere.

Synthetic monitoring doesn't require installation, except for its [private minions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions) feature.

    ## Check out some dashboards

    Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages. If you don't see that, revisit the install instructions or see [Not seeing data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

    Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more:
    * Video: [An intro to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) (2:20)
    * [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
    * [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-ui-overview)
    * [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
    * [Distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui)
    * [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)

    Want to build your own dashboards? To build charts, you'll need to learn to [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Add more data

    If you need data from other sources, choose from [our hundreds of integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Set up alerting

    Want to get notifications for issues?
    * [Set up your first alert.](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition)
    * [Learn about important alerting concepts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms)

    Note that some of the [quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability) come with alerts already set up.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Add users

    You're now ready to add the rest of your team to New Relic. Use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) to add users. To learn about the different types of users, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). See [our tutorial on adding users and managing user access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial).

If you're on our [Free edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#editions), you don't have access to our global technical support service. To get 24-7 support, [upgrade to a paid edition](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core/plan-management/home?state=7a437d0d-1905-4143-d3a1-68ddfcb6db53). Alternatively, use [our community forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com) to ask questions and see answers.

If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see the complete list at [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/). You'll find integrations bundled into quickstarts, providing you instant access to pre-built dashboards and alerts specific to your technology.

Once you have data coming into New Relic, learn more about the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) or [set up alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/).
