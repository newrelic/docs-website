# How it works [#how-it-works]

The first step in observability requires collecting lots of performance data, known as telemetry data. Our observability platform gathers data from your services using agents. An agent is a file or a few lines of code that collects data on your service and sends it to our platform for analysis. Instrumentation is the process of making something measurable. Agents integrate into a service as part of this process. You might instrument a gas tank by installing a meter that measures how full or empty your tank is. You monitor your tank; when it approaches empty, you know it's time to fill up again.

New Relic does something similar. An agent is a file or piece of code that you attach to a particular service during an installation procedure. Like a gas meter, our agents keep track of the service's performance by monitoring metrics such as response times and error rates. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into the functioning of your service and identify areas for improvement. An agent is first installed in your environment with a default configuration. The process of installation, setup, and instrumentation can vary. It depends on the service you want to collect data from.

These are the agents at New Relic:

* **APM agent**: For server-side applications

* **Browser agent**: For browser applications

* **Infrastructure agents**: For hosts and on-host integrations

* **Mobile agent**: For mobile applications

Besides these agents, we also support open-source integrations. They report data from open standards for instrumentation. These standards include OpenTelemetry and tools like DropWizard, Prometheus, and more.

Query your data to gain insight into your applications, hosts, and business-critical activity. Correlate performance metrics with business KPIs to speed up MTTD and MTTR.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Set up a dashboard

    Although [our quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability) include pre-defined dashboards to monitor your system, you can create and configure your [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/). Our dashboards allow you to create and share interactive visualizations of any data you need to see from anywhere on the New Relic platform. Use dashboards to provide context and visibility into what your system is doing in real-time.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure alerts

    Although [our quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability) include pre-defined alerts to monitor your system, you can [create and configure](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/) your alerts. Use alerts to set thresholds and receive notifications of changes in performance across your system. This will help you stay ahead of performance issues to avoid negative impacts on your users.  Keep your team focused and productive with intelligent incident management.
