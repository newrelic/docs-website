New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system, analyze that data efficiently, and respond to incidents before they become problems. As extensive as the capablities of New Relic are, you can get started with the platform by following a three-step procedure.

## Get started with New Relic [#get-started-now]

1. [Sign up for a free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) if you haven't already.
2. Use our agents and integrations to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools.

3. Check out [our quick launch guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/quick-launch-guide) for next steps.


This guide walks you through a quick and simple setup aimed at letting you use some of the most important and powerful New Relic features. It'll be most useful for small organizations with few users, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic before doing a more in-depth, at-scale rollout. 

Other options for getting started:

* For more in-depth guidance on setting up New Relic, see the [Implementation guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro).
* If you're confident you know what tools you want to install, see [Install New Relic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/install-new-relic#what). You can also add more solutions after you complete this guide.

When the infrastructure agent and APM agent are installed, log data is usually also reported (although sometimes manual configuration is necessary). 

        [Watch a video of using the guided install.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-RQIkBJOA).
        
        If you prefer or require a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the options below.

**Infrastructure agent**

Install the infrastructure agent to get host data. Choose the most relevant option:
  * Docker: [Install on a Docker container](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure-monitoring)
  * Kubernetes: 
    * [Install agent via Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm)
    * [Use our Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) to get telemetry data and dashboards
  * All else: [Install the agent on a host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/#install) 

**Cloud platforms**

Connect your cloud platforms to get data from your cloud services:

* Install cloud platforms: [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), [GCP](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations)

**Infrastructure services**

Install [on-host integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/?category=infrastructure-and-os) for popular infrastructure-related services like MySQL, Apache, Cassandra, NGINX, Kafka, and more. 

**Application data** 

Our main options for instrumenting applications: 
* [Install a language-specific APM agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm)
* [OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction)

Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages. If you don't see that, revisit the install instructions or see [Not seeing data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data). 

Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more: 
* Video: [An intro to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) (2:20)
* [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)

If you're on Standard edition, you may not have access to our global technical support service. To get 24-7 support, [upgrade to Pro or Enterprise edition](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core/plan-management/home?state=7a437d0d-1905-4143-d3a1-68ddfcb6db53). Alternatively, use [our community forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com) to ask questions and see answers.

If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see the larger list at [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/). You'll find integrations bundled into quickstarts, providing you instant access to pre-built dashboards and alerts specific to your technology.

Once you have data coming into New Relic, learn more about the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) or [set up alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts/). If you're curious about pricing, we have a [blog post set up to help you with cost estimation](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost). 

## Analyze your data

With your data [secure](/docs/security/new-relic-security/compliance/data-encryption) at New Relic, our platform can alert you to problems and help you organize, process, and understand your data, whether it's [metrics, events, logs, or traces](https://newrelic.com/platform/telemetry-data-101/):

* [Explore your data visually](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer): Jump into metrics and events to navigate all your data and make connections between your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) without any knowledge of query languages.
* [Query and visualize your data:](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) Use our curated dashboard visualizations or create your own. Use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) (New Relic Query Language) to slice and dice your data and dig deeper into questions.
* [Query your data programmatically:](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor.

## Respond to incidents faster [#respond-faster]

DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently.

* Let [applied intelligence](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai), our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents.
* [Proactive detection](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/proactive-detection-new-relic-ai): Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them.
* [Get notifications:](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts) Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified.
