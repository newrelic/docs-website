import observability from 'images/observability.png'

New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system and how to improve it.

This short video shows twenty of the most common ways to get your data into New Relic (approx. 5:22 minutes):

With New Relic, you can:

* **[Bring all your data together](#bring-your-data):** Instrument everything and import data from across your technology stack using our agents, integrations, and APIs, and access it from a single UI.
* [**Analyze your data**](#analyze-your-data): Get all your data at your fingertips to find the root causes of problems and optimize your systems. Build dashboards and charts or use our powerful query language.
* **[Respond to incidents quickly](#respond-faster)**: Our machine learning solution proactively detects and explains anomalies and warns you before they become problems.

## Get started with New Relic [#get-started-now]

Here's how you can quickly get started capturing and analyzing your data:

1. If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at [newrelic.com/signup](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever!
2. Follow the steps in our [Add your data](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJ0dWNzb24ucGxnLWluc3RydW1lbnQtZXZlcnl0aGluZyJ9) UI page to get data flowing in. For your first install, we recommend the **Guided install** option, which will set up many integrations with a single command.
3. Once you have data coming into New Relic, learn more about the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) or [set up alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts/).

## All the answers in one place [#answers-in-one-place]

New Relic is built for full stack observability. It links all relevant data so that you get the whole picture of everything that enables your systems to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button.

As just one example of what you can do with New Relic, imagine you are a Kubernetes administrator overseeing many clusters and pods of software containers. Where do you start troubleshooting? This short video shows how you can locate a problem cluster and use distributed tracing to find relevant logs:

## Bring all your data together [#bring-your-data]

Capture, organize, and make sense of your data in New Relic, no matter where it comes from. Use our [agents and integrations](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relic-integrations) to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools, or use [our APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis) for data that’s more specific to your business or technology.

If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see a larger list at [New Relic Instant Observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/). There you will find integrations bundled into quickstarts, providing you instant access to pre-built dashboards and alerts specific to your technology.

[New Relic](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) gives you access to a wide range of observability tools, including:

* [Application monitoring](/docs/apm)
* [Browser monitoring](/docs/browser)
* [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure)
* [Log management](/docs/logs)
* [Mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring)
* [Network monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/get-started/npm-introduction/)
* [Serverless monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring)
* [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics)

You can start anywhere, but you'll never get lost. True observability across your entire stack means that you're in control.

## Analyze your data

With your data [secure](/docs/security/new-relic-security/compliance/data-encryption) at New Relic, our platform can alert you to problems and help you organize, process, and understand your data, whether it's [metrics, events, logs, or traces](https://newrelic.com/platform/telemetry-data-101/ "Link opens in a new window."):

* [Explore your data visually](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer): Jump into our data explorer to navigate all your data and make connections between your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) without any knowledge of query languages.
* [Query and visualize your data:](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) Use our curated dashboard visualizations or create your own. Use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) (New Relic Query Language) to slice and dice your data and dig deeper into questions.
* [Query your data programmatically:](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor.

## Respond to incidents faster [#respond-faster]

DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently.

* Let [applied intelligence](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai), our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents.
* [Proactive detection](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/proactive-detection-new-relic-ai): Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them.
* [Get notifications:](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts) Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified.

## Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack [#start-anywhere]

Being fully connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod.

Use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) in [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/) to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but they can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also [create your own entities](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions#entity-definitions). The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.
