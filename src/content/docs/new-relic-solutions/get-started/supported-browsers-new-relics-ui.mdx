## Supported browsers [#requirements]

Our UI supports the two most recent desktop versions for these browsers:

* Google Chrome: Linux, macOS, Windows
* Microsoft Edge: Windows
* Mozilla Firefox: Linux, macOS, Windows
  * Extended Support Release (ESR) versions of Firefox are not supported.
* Safari: macOS

If your browser version is not supported, it may still work. However, to get the best functionality from our site (and others), we encourage you to upgrade to a supported version.

## Limited support

Our UI provides limited support for mobile browsers. To access New Relic from a mobile device, install our [Android app](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-android-app/features/new-relic-android-app) or [iOS app](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-ios-app/features/new-relic-ios-app). The workflows in our mobile apps are specifically designed for phone use cases. The web interface is not actively supported on mobile browsers.
