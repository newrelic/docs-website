*This is the first part of [the New Relic implementation guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro).*

When you first sign up for New Relic, there are some important account- and user-related decisions to make. In this stage of the implementation, you'll: 

* Make some important initial account decisions
* Think about who your New Relic team leads will be
* Think about what system components you need to instrument
* Think about some strategies for organizing your data (for example, tags)

## Initial account setup [#account-setup]

When you [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup), you get a *New Relic organization*. This organization is the container for your organization's data, accounts, and users. Here are some important things to consider when you first create your organization.

### Decide on data center region [#data-center]

When you sign up for New Relic, you must choose which of our two data center regions your organization will be in: US or EU. There are some differences between the regions: for example, they have different API endpoints, and have some feature differences. 

[Learn more about data center regions.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/)

### Think about the edition you'll need [#edition]

A New Relic organization can use New Relic [free, forever](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free). When a New Relic organization starts to pay for New Relic, it can be on one of three editions: **Standard**, **Pro**, or **Enterprise**. You can always upgrade your edition later, but for larger organizations it may make sense to look at the editions to understand the features of each and which you'll likely end up on: [see our pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 

### Decide on security compliance needs [#security-compliance]

New Relic offers a high level of security by default ([read more about our security features](https://newrelic.com/security)). But certain industries require much higher levels of security compliance (for example, healthcare and financial institutions). For these organizations, we offer FedRAMP and HIPAA security compliance. These options require an organization to have Enterprise edition ([learn more about editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing)) and our Data Plus option. Data Plus gives you access to some powerful data features, like increased retention and higher query limits. [Read more about the benefits of Data Plus.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus)

For more on our compliancy features, see the docs: 

* [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints)
* [HIPAA](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic/)

## Decide on team leads [#admin-users]

You'll want to decide which of your team members will be your initial New Relic team leads. These will be the team members who do one or more of the following: 

* Set up and configure instrumentation
* Add and manage New Relic users
* Oversee billing
* Train your users and answer questions

Here are some tips for adding your team leads to New Relic: 

* **User type.** There are three user types: basic users, core users, and full platform users. *Basic users* can get data reporting and use some basic features but lack access to our more advanced observability and administrative features. For more administrative duties, choose *core user* or *full platform user*. [Learn more about user type.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) 
* **Groups.** You'll probably want to add admins to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#default-groups), which gives them access to everything. [Learn more about groups.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#understand-concepts) 
* We recommend using a spreadsheet to plan out your users' New Relic responsibilities.

## Understand billing [#understand-billing]

Your team should have an understanding of what the billing factors are and what you get for free.

## Plan instrumentation [#plan-instrumentation]

To get the most out of New Relic, you'll want to spend some time thinking about what your observability goals are. The larger your organization is, the more important this planning is. 

Some tips for getting more clear about your plans: 

* Brainstorm what your observability goals are and how you'll achieve them. What are the main business units involved? What are the key performance indicators you'll use to measure success? 
* If you've used other monitoring solutions in the past, think about what the pain points have been and how might you improve things this time around. 
* Make a diagram of your system architecture, both hardware and software. What components are on-premises versus in the cloud? Decide what entities (apps, hosts, services, etc.) you'll need to monitor to achieve your goals. 
* Create a spreadsheet that maps out your monitored entities and how those relate to your teams or other business units.
* Do you want to use New Relic for all your observability needs? Or are you planning on using a variety of tools? There can be value in switching to New Relic for everything, so that all your data is in one place. Keep in mind you can also forward data from other services to New Relic.
* These are some things you might want to think about. If you'd like in-depth guidance on achieving optimal observability, check out [our **Observability maturity** series](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/introduction) (for example, [this guide on determining what to instrument](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/service-characterization-optimize-telemetry-data-guide)).

## Think about data organization [#data-organization]

The more organized your New Relic data is, the easier it'll be to: 

* Search and query your data
* Create alerts for your data
* Troubleshoot a problem 

Some important strategies for organizing your data are:

* [**Tags**](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data) help you quickly see relationships between your monitored entities, which helps you more easily troubleshoot problems. It's important to have a strong tagging strategy. For example, it's good practice to have everyone use the same tag naming structure and consistently use the same tags. If you don't already have one, consider creating a tagging strategy for your organization.
* Our [**workloads** feature](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) lets you group related apps, services, hosts, and other entities into business-relevant groupings and see information about them in one dashboard. Spend some time thinking about how you might group related entities into workloads. 
* We'll mention tags and workloads again later in this guide, but if your organization is large, it might help to do some thinking about these things now. 

## Consider multiple accounts [#multiple-accounts]

Using multiple accounts is another potential way to organize your data. 

When you sign up for New Relic, it creates a *New Relic organization* with a single account. You can only have a single account in your organization unless you have Pro or Enterprise edition, which allow for multiple accounts.

You should try to minimize the number of accounts you have. This keeps your account and user structure simple, and gives users easier access to relevant data. Some reasons to add an account: 

* To separate production and staging/testing environments (although this can be also done with tags). 
* To make it easier to separate billing for different departments. 
* To control user access to projects that require firm boundaries. For example, if you want a team to only have access to a specific app's data, you can create an account for that app.

When data is reported to New Relic, it reports to a specific account, as represented by that account's account ID. We recommend using a spreadsheet to plan out the accounts you'll need and track the account IDs: this can be the same spreadsheet you use to map out user access.

[Learn more about adding accounts.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure)

## Understand the available APIs [#apis]

Understanding some basics about our APIs will come in handy later during instrumentation and configuration. Our APIs include: 

* Our **data ingest APIs**: these are our APIs for our four core data types: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Our data-reporting tools send data via these APIs, and the APIs can also be used directly. Our main data ingest key is the license key. The license key is tied to a specific account ID. Our more automated install options include the correct license key for you. 
* **Our GraphQL-format API**, which we call **NerdGraph**. This is used for everything except data ingest, from querying your data to configuring New Relic features. NerdGraph requires a user key, which is a personal key unique to each user. 

[Learn more about our APIs.](/docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis/)

## Plan out and add users [#plan-add-users]

*Note that only Pro and Enterprise editions allow multiple accounts, the ability to add custom groups and roles, and the ability to have more than five full platform users. This means that if you have free tier or Standard edition, planning out your users will likely be less important.*

So far, you've added your New Relic admins but likely haven't added other users yet. 

For organizations with roughly 15 users or more, it's helpful to plan out your users' New Relic access. This is especially the case if you require granular control over which accounts and roles your users will be able to access. But if you'll only have a few users, or if you're planning on giving most or all of your users access to all New Relic features, it's less important to plan out user access.

Some suggested steps: 
* [Read some basics of how our user management system works.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts) 
* Plan out which team members will get access to New Relic, what their [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) will be, and what accounts they'll have access to. 

Ready to add users? Some options:
* Want to use single sign-on or manage your users from your identity provider? [See our user login and management options.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim)
* Want to add users manually from our UI? See [Add users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial#add-users). 
* Want to programmatically manage accounts and users? See [our NerdGraph API docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-user-mgmt). 

Also note that you can always add users later, after you've got data reporting.
