Maintaining a website combines the efforts of multiple teams. When outages happen, developer and engineering teams can resolve issues directly. As a digital marketer, however, you may not have the same access to site administration. While your team's success is just as dependent on site performance, you might not have the tools to identify or address any issue yourselves.

Our website performance monitoring (WPM) tool gives insight into your site's availability and performance. With out-of-the-box alerts and routine checks from our monitors, you'll never be uncertain about how your site performs.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc helps you set up WPM, then walks you through understanding your data. In this tutorial, you will:

* Set up monitoring without an installation 
* Learn about your collected data 

## Set up WPM [#setup]
<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Get data without an installation

    WPM requires no installation or setup. To access WPM, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Choose your URL 

    Once you've chosen pages to monitor, New Relic deploys a set of monitors from different servers around the globe that check each page for website availability, broken links, performance, and SSL certificate expiration. To get started, we recommend choosing these pages:

    * Your homepage
    * Pages with critical assets, like important videos, images, or links
    * Pages critical to your customer funnel such as thank you pages or product pages

New Relic will take a few minutes to deploy the monitors, then you'll start receiving data about your website. Keep in mind that WPM doesn't check all pages across your site, only the ones you've manually added.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add Google PageSpeed API key 

We draw core web vitals from Google's API so that scores in New Relic match what you have in Google. To continue capturing these scores after initial setup, you'll need to create a [Google PageSpeed API key](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started). 

<img
    title="Input your Google PageSpeed API key to capture core web vitals"
    alt="Capture your core web vitals after inputting your Google PageSpeed API key"
    src={pageSpeedAPI}

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Put your data in context

Once your monitors report data to New Relic, your WPM page displays metrics that can help you improve user experience and SEO ranking. WPM gives you four kinds of data: ping checks, user experience tracking, content allocation, and broken links scans. 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="ping"
        title="Check page availability"
    >
<img
    title="View your page availability"
    alt="View page availability"
    src={pingWPM}
/>

The first section of WPM shows you ping data. This kind of data is an availability check, confirming basic site functionalities:

* **Site availability**. This reports whether your page has loaded at all. If it hasn't, there might be an issue with your servers or domain.
* **Page load time**. This collects the median speed for how long it takes your page to load all of its assets. This data gets further broken down by content type and size.
* **SSL Validity**. This tells you whether your SSL certificate is valid, expiring, or expired. It'll include the date you need to renew your SSL certificate as well.
* **Broken links**. After testing all the links on your page, it'll report back which links are broken. 

WPM collects data by capturing site behavior via monitors that interact with your site. This lets you see updated data on a day-to-day basis so you never have to guess when assets or pages fail to load.

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser

    >
<img
    title="View user experience"
    alt="View your data about how user's experience your site"
    src={userExp}
/>

Google PageSpeed reports your core web vitals alongside other metrics collected by New Relic. This data gives you insight into how users experience your site. 

* **First contentful paint**. This captures the time it takes for the first asset to load on a page. In the above screenshot, it took the site 3.22s for something to load on the page. 
* **Largest contentful paint**. Unlike first contentful paint, this captures the time taken for the largest content on the page to fully load. For example, if information about an important campaign appears in a page's largest asset, then this number tells us how long a user waits before seeing it. In the above screenshot, it took 2.79s. 
* **First input delay**. When a user interacts with an element on your site, it takes time to process the user's interaction This number captures that time as a delay between the request (user interaction) and response (how the page changes based on the user request).
* **Cumulative layout shift**. This measures visual stability of different assets on your site. For example, after a user goes to your site's main page, images may shift while loading. This movement is unanticipated.

    alt="Adjust timeslice data"

New Relic contextualizes this data over time. You can click and drag over relevant parts of this chart, which gives you more granular insight about site behavior. When you're finished, click the time stamp button at the top to adjust back to your preferred time period. 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="content"
        title="Compare content size, load times, and sources"
    >
<img
    title="Analyze content size"
    alt="Analyze content size"
    src={contentWPM}
/>

Your webpage is made up of different types of content, like HTML, images, JavaScript, and videos. Our content charts show you how different content types perform relative to one another. For example:

* **Content size** shows you the size in kilobytes of each type. Referring to the above chart, you can see that your JavaScript content type is proportionally smaller than your images on a given page. If your site's performance is down, you can request that your dev team optimizes your site on the code-level.
* **Content sources** breaks down where your content is hosted by size. For example, in the above chart, the bulk of your content is sourced from New Relic, represented by the yellow. If your content is optimized but still broken on your page, then changing where you're sourcing your content could resolve that error. 
* **Content load time** shows how long it takes a given content type to load relative to the entire page's load time.  
* **Network** breaks down how content is delivered to the page and how much time it takes to deliver that content. 

If your page is loading slowly, then you can use the **Content** section to diagnose potential sources of the problem. For example, comparing **Content size** to **Content load time** can give insight into whether CSS is taking up too many resources and loading last, which would cause a delay in largest contentful paint. If content size is optimal but page load is still slow, perhaps it's a network or source issue.

        title="Fix broken links"
    >

<img
    title="Your page's broken links"
    alt=""
    src={brokenLinksWPM}
/>  

If user engagement is down but your site is available and content is optimized, then something else might be at play. With WPM, your monitors routinely ping your chosen pages for broken links and report back. A possible journey to troubleshoot might look like:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.
2. Check the availability of your page. It reads as available. 
3. Your core web vitals are reporting as **Good** across the board.
4. You notice timeslice data shows a steep drop-off in traffic the day before, around the time your team made updates to your landing page.
5. WPM shows that a broken link has been reported. It's a link inside a banner that's used across your site.

At this point, you can coordinate with the relevant teams to fix the broken link and deploy an update for the rest of the site.

## What's next? [#next]

WPM is designed to simplify getting detailed insight about your site. But you can use New Relic to collect data about real user traffic or key user flows. Depending on your organization's structure, you might need to loop in your developer team to set these up. We recommend you start with these features: 

* [Create a codeless step monitor](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics/monitor-create) that mimics a user journey through your site, such as adding an item, logging in, or filling out a form. If you're uncertain, check out our tutorial on [how to create a step monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/#step).
* You can [add a Javascript snippet](https://onenr.io/0gR76llakwo) to your code to start tracking real user data with our browser agent. 
* Want to learn more about how New Relic can improve your website? We have a tutorial about [improving your website's performance](/docs/journey-performance/improve-website-performance).
