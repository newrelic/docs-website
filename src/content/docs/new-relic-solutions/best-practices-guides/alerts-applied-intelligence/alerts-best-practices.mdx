With alerts, you can start detecting issues before they turn critical. Using NRQL, our New Relic query language, you can [create and customize your alerts conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/) that focus on what you're most concerned about. Use <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to be updated about unusual behavior in your data, route notifications to the people who need to see it, and make effective decisions while knowing the root cause of your issue.

Improve your alert coverage by using our recommendations about how to best use alert response, maintenance, quality, and advanced settings. See our [Alert quality management](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/alert-quality-management-guide) guide to know how to measure and improve your alerting quality.

You can follow these recommended actions to improve and get the most out of your alert configuration.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Have an explanatory name for the alert
      </td>

      <td>
        The description and the tags must give you self-descriptive alerts to know which service is wrong, which environment is involved, which team owns it, and if it's impacting to end users. It helps you to answer faster and decide what to do.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Add tags to your alert conditions
      </td>

      <td>
        Your issues and incidents have these tags in their metadata. Use them to do flexible filters in workflows or add them to your notification payload.

        Issues have 3 sources of tags:

        * The [tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#add-via-ui-api) defined on the alert condition.
        * The current values from the [`facet/where` clause](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#syntax) from the alert condition.
        * The tags from the breaching entity if the alerts results are scoped to a unique entity. If the incident isn't scoped to the entity, entity tags won't be brought over.

        These events are stored in NRDB. Don't worry about the nr\* tables consumption because they aren't counted as ingest.

## Alert condition creation and advanced settings [#alert-condition-creation]

If you're new to alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage, pay attention to these recommendations:

* [Get recommended alerts by technology](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability)
* [Let New Relic find your coverage gaps](https://one.newrelic.com/nrai/detection-gaps/home)
* [Get condition recommendations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/condition-recommendations/)

### Understand signal [#understand-signal]

Every alert condition generates a signal or multiple signals if the condition contains a facet clause. Each possible facet value will create a distinct signal.

You can query all signals in [`NrAiSignal`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAiSignal). This allows you to get details about the value that was observed, how many data points were considered, and in the case of anomaly conditions, the expected value and standard deviation. It also gives information about the time delta between New Relic time and your raw data time (if your data is timestamped) which can help you find the most accurate delay setting when creating your conditions.

### Maintaining entity health [#maintaining-entity-health]

We use signals to infer the health and alert coverage of an entity. If the results of an alert condition contain data from only one entity, New Relic will tie it to the health of that entity, and these events will show in context in the New Relic UI.

It's recommended, for most conditions, to maintain the existence of a signal. No signal may result in New Relic showing grey (unknown) health status for some entities as well as adding these entities to the list of not covered entities.

If the `where` clause of your condition excludes all the data, there will be no data left. This is a [loss of signal](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAX8W0000008bEyWAI/relic-solution-how-can-i-figure-out-when-to-use-gap-filling-and-loss-of-signal) for New Relic and the alert condition CAN'T be evaluated against ANY threshold. It means that the result of the NRQL query doesn't have data, but it doesn't mean that New Relic is not receiving data. If you want to receive a notification, you must add a loss of signal threshold.

Use the most generic filters in your `where` section and the most specific ones in your `select` section. Use the filter function to accurately measure what you care about. For example:

```sql
SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE ErrorCode = 123) FROM Transaction 
WHERE AppName = 'Application1' AND Environment = 'Production'
```

### Alert delay or timer duration [#alert-delay]

Try to adjust the [delay/time](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#delay-timer) with your data's behavior. A short delay may trigger false alerts because of incomplete data and a large delay may increase the time you get notified. New Relic doesn't know how much data to expect nor how late that data might reach an endpoint of New Relic. Depending of the log shipper and configuration, log data can be batched and see significant delay for low volumes logs.

### Set your condition thresholds [#condition-thresholds]

Set meaningful [threshold](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/) levels to optimize alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Action
      </th>

      <th>
        Recommendations
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Set threshold levels
      </td>

      <td>
        Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Experimenting with settings
      </td>

      <td>
        You don't need to edit files or restart the software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Adjust settings
      </td>

      <td>
        Adjust your conditions over time.

        * Tighten your thresholds as long as you use New Relic to keep pace with your improved performance.
        * If you're rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Disable settings
      </td>

      <td>
        You can <DNT>**disable any condition**</DNT> in a policy, if necessary. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The color-coded [health status indicator](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#health-status) in the UI of New Relic changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through the UI before having a critical threshold, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There're two incident thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the above-mentioned suggestions.

### Ensure your daily batch jobs run[#batch-jobs]

You can set up an alert condition to receive a notification if your batch jobs fail to run.

Assuming you're sending an event to New Relic as part of your batch job, you can set up an alert condition to notify you if your batch jobs fail to run.

1. Set up a simple count query on the event.

   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM MyBatchEvent
   ```

2. Set Loss of Signal to open a new incident after 24 hours and 30 minutes. You can adjust this, but it's a good idea to allow for a late-running batch job.

3. Make sure to use the [Event Timer](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/choose-your-aggregation-method/#event-timer-detail) streaming aggregation method. Since you'll only ever get 1 data point every 24 hours, you can set the timer to its lowest setting, 5 seconds.

## Use non-null values when there's no signal

By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or [configure gap filling values via NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-loss-signal-gap-filling/#loss-of-signal).

<Callout variant="important">
  Configuring gap-filling doesn't prevent the 'Loss of Signal' from triggering.
</Callout>

## Define your issue creation preferences [#issue-creation]

Decide when you get issue notifications so you can respond to issues when they happen.

If you're new to alerts, learn more about your [issue preferences options](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/specify-when-alerts-create-incidents/).

The default issue preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one issue. Change your default issue preference setting to increase or decrease the number of issues and issue notifications you receive.

Each team within your organization can have different needs. Ask your team 2 important questions when deciding your issue preferences:

* Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong?
* Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once?

When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope, like managing the performance of several entities, increase the number of issues you receive. You can need more notifications because 2 issues can't necessarily relate to each other.

When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope, like managing the performance of one entity, opt for the default issue preference. You need fewer notifications when 2 issues are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem.
