## Problem

You do not see data in the UI after [installing a New Relic agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent).

## Solution

You should start seeing data within a few minutes after installing a New Relic agent and generating traffic for your app. If you don't see data, you can use the [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) utility to automatically identify common issues. For additional troubleshooting tips, see the agent-specific docs. 

### APM agents

Follow the troubleshooting procedures for your APM agent:

* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-go)
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-java)
* [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-net)
* [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-nodejs-installation)
* [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-php)
* [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-python)
* [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-ruby)

In addition, you can try these troubleshooting steps that apply to all APM agents:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="deleted_apps"
    title="Deleted or renamed applications in APM"
  >
    An app needs to stop reporting data for at least an hour before you can reuse that name. It also needs to reconnect with the New Relic collector (be restarted) before new data will be accepted.

    The app remains in the collector's cache for an hour before it is flushed. During that time it is marked as "deleted," so no new data is accepted. Also, the data is associated with an executing app that has been deleted until the agent is restarted.

    For more information, see:

    * [Name your application](/docs/site/naming-your-application)
    * [Use multiple names for an app](/docs/site/using-multiple-names-for-an-app)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data_collection"
    title="No connection to collector"
  >
    Your app will not be affected if the New Relic agent cannot connect to the [collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector). Data continues to be collected, and it is uploaded as soon as the connection is restored.

    While the network is down or the collector unavailable, you may see gaps where data is missing in the APM CPU and memory charts. The agent will continue attempting to reconnect, and when it succeeds, you will again see data appearing in the UI.

    During the time the agent is unable to communicate with the collector, it is still collecting data. Once it is able to connect again, it will upload the data and fill in the missing segment so there will not be any confusion about whether your application was down or just not reporting data. To save memory, the data will be aggregated and averaged over the period, so you will see flat bars and charts over the period when it was unable to communicate with the collector.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
