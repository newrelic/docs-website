Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy. The Diagnostics CLI inspects system information and New Relic product artifacts (logs and config files) that are relevant for performing diagnostic checks that assess New Relic product configuration and operability.

By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).

## License agreements [#diagnostics-licenses]

The use of the Diagnostics CLI is subject to this [license agreement](/docs/licenses/license-information/other-licenses/new-relic-diagnostics-licenses), as well as licensing agreements for open-source software used by the Diagnostics CLI.

## Data uploaded to account [#uploaded-account-data]

The Diagnostics CLI allows uploading of this information to a support ticket over HTTPS if you use a specific command-line argument. You will be prompted before the collection of any files that we expect to have sensitive information.

Before the collected files [contained within `nrdiag-output.zip` and `nrdiag-output.json`](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/interpret-nrdiag-output) are uploaded to New Relic, you will also be prompted. This allows you to review and edit any information that you do not want to provide. (For example, the `nrdiag-output.zip` will include your user name.) You also have the option to cancel the upload altogether.

## Data storage

Any support ticket attachments made using `nrdiag` or containing `nrdiag` data that are less than or equal to 20MB are stored by Zendesk. All of these attachments are stored by New Relic. For more information, see [Zendesk's privacy and data protection policies](https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy-and-data-protection/).
