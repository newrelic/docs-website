To use the Diagnostics CLI:

1. Review the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/diagnostics-release-notes/diagnostics-cli-release-notes/), to make sure you have the latest version.
2. [Download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip), which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
3. Move the executable for your platform into the [location of your application's root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory).
4. Temporarily raise the [logging level](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-agent-logs-troubleshooting) for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application.
5. Run the executable. **Recommendation:** To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run `nrdiag` with a [task suite](#suites) (CLI option).

The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data.

## Platform-specific procedures [#platform]

To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="linux-run"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI:

       * From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the `nrdiag.zip` file is present.

         OR
       * [Manually download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip).
    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/linux` directory, move `nrdiag` into the application's root directory.
    4. Run `nrdiag` (along with any [CLI options](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/pass-command-line-options-nrdiag)

       ```
       ./nrdiag <var>CLI_OPTIONS</var>
       ```

       The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/mac` directory, move `nrdiag` into the application's root directory.
    4. Run `nrdiag` (along with any [CLI options](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/pass-command-line-options-nrdiag)

       ```
       ./nrdiag <var>CLI_OPTIONS</var>
       ```

       The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

    1. Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI:

       * From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the `nrdiag.zip` file is present.

         OR
       * [Manually download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip).
    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/win` directory, move `nrdiag.exe` or `nrdiag_x64.exe` into the application's root directory.
    4. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's **parent** directory, or specify your config file location with the `-c` option.
    5. Run the executable (along with any [CLI options](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/pass-command-line-options-nrdiag) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an admin shell.

       Run via PowerShell if you add any `CLI_OPTIONS`:

       ```
       ./nrdiag.exe <var>CLI_OPTIONS</var>
       ```

       **OR**, for x64 systems:

       ```
       ./nrdiag_x64.exe <var>CLI_OPTIONS</var>
       ```

       The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

    1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, [manually download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip).
    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/`<var>OS</var> directory, run `nrdiag` (along with any [CLI options](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/pass-command-line-options-nrdiag):

       ```
       ./nrdiag -browser-url <var>WEBSITE_URL</var> <var>CLI_OPTIONS</var>
       ```

       The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

    To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the `docker exec` command:

    1. [Download](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip) and unzip the `nrdiag_latest.zip` file.
    2. Copy the binary to the container. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of your docker container:

       ```
       docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag <var>IMAGE_NAME</var>:/bin
       ```
    3. Run the `nrdiag` command in the docker container. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` as above, and replace `APPLICATION_ROOT` with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent:

       ```
       docker exec -it -w <var>APPLICATION_ROOT</var> <var>IMAGE_NAME</var> nrdiag
       ```
    4. (Optional) Remove the `nrdiag` binary when finished:

       ```
       docker exec <var>IMAGE_NAME</var> rm /bin/nrdiag
       ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) [#suites]

A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives.

To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the `-help suites` option:

```
./nrdiag -help suites
```

To run suites with `nrdiag`, provide the `-suites` flag and one or more suite names (for example, `java`) to run as arguments.

**Linux and macOS:**

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag -suites <var>SUITE NAMES</var>
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag_x64 -suites <var>SUITE NAMES</var>
  ```

**Windows:**

To run from PowerShell, add `./` to the start of `cmd`.

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag.exe -suites <var>SUITE NAMES</var>
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag_x64.exe -suites <var>SUITE NAMES</var>
  ```

## Include additional files in the zip [#include-additional-files]

If you have additional files that you would like to share with support, you can include them in the `nrdiag-output.zip` file using the `-include` command line flag. This can be used with a single file or a directory. If a directory is provided, all of its subdirectories are included. The total size limit of the files included is 4GB.

Use this in combination with `-attach` to [upload the files](#attach-account-results) to your New Relic account.

**Linux and macOS:**

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag -include <var>./path/to/file</var> -attach
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag_x64 -include <var>/entire/directory/</var> -attach
  ```

**Windows:**

To run from PowerShell, add `./` to the start of `cmd`.

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag -include <var>Path\To\File</var> -attach
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag_x64.exe -include <var>\Entire\Directory\</var> -attach
  ```

## Upload results to a New Relic account [#attach-account-results]

<Callout variant="important">
  If your system is configured to **not** connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the [output files](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/interpret-nrdiag-output) in an email to New Relic Support. If there is an issue with your license key, you will also need to send your output files in an email to support.
</Callout>

### Automatic Account upload [#automatic]

To upload your results automatically to a New Relic account when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the `-attach` or `-a` command line flag. This will validate any New Relic License Keys found in your environment for upload.

Uploading your results to an account will automatically upload the contents of the `nrdiag-output.json` and `nrdiag-output.zip`. 

**Linux and macOS:**

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag -attach
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  ./nrdiag_x64 -attach
  ```

**Windows:**

To run from PowerShell, add `./` to the start of `cmd`.

* For 32-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag.exe -attach
  ```
* For 64-bit systems:

  ```
  nrdiag_x64.exe -attach
  ```
