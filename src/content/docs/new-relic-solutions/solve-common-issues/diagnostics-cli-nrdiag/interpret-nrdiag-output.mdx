After executing the Diagnostics CLI from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a `Warning` or `Failure` status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation. If you use the `-attach` flag, you can view your results in [the UI](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/interpret-nrdiag-output/#diag-in-nr1)

## File output

The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Diagnostics output files
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.zip`
      </td>

      <td>
        A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing logs from New Relic. Attach this file to your New Relic account. This archive also contains a copy of `nrdiag-output.json`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>

      <td>
        Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to your New Relic account.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-filelist.txt`
      </td>

      <td>
        A list of files found. The `nrdiag-output.zip` file that you attach to your New Relic account automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this `.txt` file separately.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Result status codes [#status-codes]

The Diagnostics CLI returns the following status codes after running:

<table>

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `Success`
      </td>

      <td>
        Task successfully executed with no issues detected.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Warning`

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Failure`
      </td>

      <td>
        Task failed with issues detected.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Error`
      </td>

      <td>
        Task unable to execute. This could be due to a permissions issues.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `None`
      </td>

      <td>
