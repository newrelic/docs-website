<Callout title="Preview">
    This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out!
 </Callout>

We've made some big changes to the New Relic platform UI to make it simpler and customizable so that it works better for you.

* **There's more space.** By clearing away UI from the top and sides, we've given you more space to focus on what matters: your data. You can even collapse the left nav to give yourself even more room.
* **See what you want to see.** The left nav is fully customizable so you can jump more quickly to what you use most. Add the tools, views, and features you use the most, and change it as often as you like.
* **The left nav is stable.** No matter how often you click around within a capability or a feature, the left nav is a steady and stable place for you to return to in the UI.
* **Work in the dark.** Our designers have refined and crafted our dark mode into an elegant experience for those of you who like working in the dark. 

## Turn it on (or off) [#on]

To turn on the new navigation: Click your user menu in the top right corner, and then toggle **New design** to **On**. (If you need to turn it off for any reason, click the user menu in the bottom left corner of the new left nav, then click the toggle to **Off**.)

Thank you for opting in to try it out. Let us know what you think about our new UI!

## How this serves you better [#why]

<img
  title="The new home UI"
  alt="A screenshot of the new home page UI."
  src={home}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

With this update you have a simpler, more stable UI experience that gets out of your way and creates more screen real estate so you can focus on what's most important: the health of your system.

Not only that, you can customize the UI as much and as often as you like, so that it can change as your needs do.

## Browse for any technology you use [#add-more]

<img
  title="The monitor everything UI"
  alt="A screenshot of the new monitor everything page UI."
  src={monitorEverything}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

In the left nav, go to **+ Add data** to see a catalog of hundreds of New Relic-compatible data sources, pre-built dashboards, useful alerting conditions, and other apps and visualizations. If you're using a technology, chances are good we can monitor it for you.

Not only that, our catalog guides you through the installation process by pointing you to interactive installation paths and specific docs so you can get started as quickly and painlessly as possible. 

## Customize your experience [#customize]

<img
  title="The all capabilities page with pinned items"
  alt="A screenshot of the all capabilities page with pins highlighted."
  src={allCapabilities}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

Go to **All capabilities** to see a catalog of all of our tools, views, and features. Click around to discover and learn more about things you aren't using and to try out new solutions to your problems.

Do you use something all the time? Click its pin to stick it the left nav for easy access. Click an active pin to remove that capability from the left nav.

<CollapserGroup>

  We recommend you start by pinning these capabilities:

  * APM &amp; services

  * Detection &amp; AI
  * Recommendations

  As you use our platform, we encourage you to keep customizing the UI, by pinning what's most useful, and unpinning what's not.

## See everything you're monitoring in one place [#see-everything]

<img
  title="The new all entities page"
  alt="A screenshot of the new all entities page."
  src={allEntities}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

Go to **All entities** to see all of your monitored entities in one place.

Here's where you'll find the New Relic Explorer. Use this to see everything you're monitoring and dig deep into the details of what's happening.

## We've moved the user menu [#user-menu]

<img
  title="The new user menu"
  alt="A screenshot of the new user menu location in the bottom left corner."
  src={userMenu}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

Find your user menu in the bottom left corner of the UI. Use it to invite a teammate to New Relic, set your user preferences, switch to dark mode, find or create API keys, and change other settings.

You can also use this menu to switch back to the old UI.

## Leave us feedback wherever you are [#feedback]

<img
  title="The feedback button"
  alt="A screenshot with the feedback button highlighted in the top right corner of the UI."
  src={feedbackButton}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

One thing isn't changing: we want your feedback. The feedback button is still there, in the bottom left corner of the UI.

If you have thoughts to share on our new UI, we'd love to hear it, good or bad.
