<Callout variant="important">
  AI insights for dynamic workloads are in **Public Preview** and have specific availability requirements. See [Requirements and limitations](#requirements) below.
</Callout>

AI insights provide intelligent summaries of your dynamic workload's health and performance using GPT-4o-mini. These summaries help you quickly understand complex workload states, identify trends, and get contextual recommendations without manually analyzing multiple metrics and entities.

## What are AI insights? [#what-are-ai-insights]

AI insights analyze the observability data visible on your dynamic workload page and generate natural language summaries that highlight:

* **Overall health status**: Current state and notable changes in workload health
* **Performance trends**: Patterns in response times, throughput, and error rates
* **Entity highlights**: Which entities are performing well or experiencing issues
* **Anomalies**: Unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior
* **Contextual recommendations**: Suggested areas to investigate based on the data

The AI analyzes only the data that's already visible on your Advanced Workloads page, ensuring insights are based on the same information you see in the UI.

## Requirements and limitations [#requirements]

### Requirements

To use AI insights for dynamic workloads:

* You must have a dynamic workload created (see [Create dynamic workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-dynamic-workload-transaction360))
* Sufficient observability data must be available for the workload entities
* You need permissions to view the workload

### Regional and compliance limitations

<Callout variant="important">
  AI insights have specific infrastructure and compliance requirements during the preview period.
</Callout>

**Regional availability:**
* AI insights are **only available for customers whose New Relic data is stored in AWS infrastructure**
* Customers on Azure infrastructure will see the AI insights button but cannot generate summaries at this time
* Check with your account team if you're unsure about your infrastructure configuration

**Compliance restrictions:**
* AI insights are **not available to FedRAMP customers** due to compliance requirements with New Relic AI (NRAI) services
* If you're subject to FedRAMP requirements, the AI insights feature is automatically disabled

### Data and privacy

* AI insights analyze only data visible on your workload page
* No additional data collection occurs when generating insights
* Insights are generated on-demand and are not stored long-term
* New Relic uses GPT-4o-mini, provided by the AI team's internal APIs

## Generate AI insights [#generate-insights]

AI insights are user-initiated and generated on-demand:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>
2. Select your dynamic workload
3. Look for the <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT> button (typically near the top of the workload summary)
4. Click <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT>

The AI will analyze your workload data and display a summary within a few seconds.

<Callout variant="tip">
  AI insights reflect the current state of your workload. If conditions change, generate new insights to get an updated summary.
</Callout>

## Interpret AI insights [#interpret-insights]

AI-generated summaries typically include several sections:

### Health overview

A high-level assessment of your workload's current state:

```
Your dynamic workload is currently healthy with 12 entities reporting normal
status. Response times are within expected ranges, and error rates remain low
across all services.
```

### Performance trends

Notable patterns in key metrics:

```
Over the past hour, throughput has increased by 23% while maintaining stable
response times. This suggests the system is handling increased load effectively.
```

### Entity highlights

Specific entities that merit attention:

```
- payment-service: Response time increased by 40ms (still within SLA)
- user-db: Connection pool utilization at 78%, approaching threshold
- checkout-api: Error rate below 0.1%, performing optimally
```

### Recommendations

Suggested actions or investigation areas:

```
Consider investigating the database connection pool usage trend. While not
critical, the increasing utilization may require scaling if traffic continues
to grow.
```

## Use AI insights effectively [#best-practices]

### When to generate insights

Generate AI insights when you:

* First look at a workload to get a quick orientation
* Notice alerts or anomalies and want contextual understanding
* Need to brief stakeholders on workload status
* Return to a workload after time away
* Want to identify trends before they become problems

### Combine insights with your analysis

AI insights are designed to accelerate your analysis, not replace it:

1. **Start with AI**: Generate insights for quick context
2. **Verify details**: Review the specific metrics and entities mentioned
3. **Investigate deeper**: Use links and data exploration for root cause analysis
4. **Take action**: Apply your expertise to make informed decisions

### Limitations of AI insights

Be aware that AI insights:

* Analyze only currently visible data (not historical trends beyond the displayed time range)
* Cannot access data from other workloads or accounts
* Provide general observations, not definitive root cause analysis
* May occasionally misinterpret complex patterns
* Are generated by AI and should be validated against the actual data

<Callout variant="caution">
  Always verify AI-generated insights against the actual metrics and use your domain expertise to make operational decisions.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### AI insights button is disabled or missing

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Regional restriction**: Your account uses Azure infrastructure (currently unsupported for AI insights)
2. **Compliance restriction**: You're on a FedRAMP account where AI features are disabled
3. **Feature access**: AI insights may not be available to your account yet during preview

**Resolution:**
* Contact your New Relic account team to verify your infrastructure configuration and feature access
* Check if you're subject to FedRAMP requirements

### Insights generation fails or times out

**Possible reasons:**

1. Insufficient data available for analysis
2. Temporary service connectivity issue
3. Workload has too many entities or complex data

**Resolution:**
* Wait a moment and try generating insights again
* Verify the workload has active entities with recent data
* If the issue persists, contact New Relic support

### Insights seem inaccurate or irrelevant

**Possible reasons:**

1. Workload data is sparse or incomplete
2. Recent changes haven't been reflected yet (data lag)
3. Entities have configuration issues affecting metrics

**Resolution:**
* Verify that all entities in your workload are properly instrumented
* Check that distributed tracing is working correctly
* Wait for the workload membership to update (5-minute refresh cycle)
* Generate fresh insights after ensuring data quality

## Feedback and future enhancements [#feedback]

AI insights for dynamic workloads are in active development. Planned enhancements include:

* Broader regional availability (Azure support)
* Historical trend analysis over longer time periods
* Customizable insight focus areas
* Integration with alert correlation
* Multi-workload comparative insights
