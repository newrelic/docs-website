<Callout variant="important">
  AI insights are in **Public Preview** with specific availability requirements.
</Callout>

AI insights provide AI-powered summaries of your [Intelligent workload's](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads) health, performance trends, and potential issues. Instead of manually analyzing dozens of charts and metrics, get instant, contextual summaries that highlight what matters most.

## What AI insights provide [#what-they-provide]

AI insights analyze all visible data on your workload page to generate:

* **Health overview**: Summary of overall workload status and entity health
* **Performance trends**: Analysis of key metrics over time (throughput, response times, errors)
* **Entity highlights**: Callouts for entities showing unusual behavior or performance changes
* **Recommendations**: Suggested areas to investigate based on observed patterns
* **Contextual observations**: Connections between different metrics and entities

AI insights help you:
* Quickly understand workload state when responding to incidents
* Identify performance degradation before it becomes critical
* Spot correlations between entity performance and workload health
* Get started with workload monitoring without deep New Relic expertise

## Requirements [#requirements]

To use AI insights with your Intelligent workload, you need:

* **Intelligent workload created**: AI insights are only available for [Intelligent workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads)
* **Sufficient observability data**: Workload entities must have recent performance data
* **AWS infrastructure only**: Not available on Azure infrastructure
* **Not available to FedRAMP customers**: Due to AI processing requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're on Azure or need FedRAMP compliance, you can still use [Standard workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads) without AI insights.
</Callout>

## Generate insights [#generate]

AI insights are generated on-demand when you need them:

1. Open your Intelligent workload
2. Review the current workload data and charts
3. Click <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT>
4. Wait 5-15 seconds while the AI analyzes your workload
5. Review the generated summary

Insights analyze only data visible on your workload page at the time of generation. Change the time range or entity filters before generating to focus the analysis.

### When to generate insights [#when-to-generate]

Generate AI insights when you need to:

* **Respond to alerts**: Quickly understand what's happening when notified of issues
* **Start your day**: Get a summary of overnight changes or current system state
* **After deployments**: Verify new releases haven't introduced problems
* **During incident response**: Speed up root cause analysis
* **Share status updates**: Get summaries to communicate with stakeholders

<Callout variant="tip">
  Regenerate insights after significant changes to see updated analysis. Insights are not stored—each generation creates a fresh summary based on current data.
</Callout>

## What insights include [#what-included]

AI insights provide structured summaries with multiple sections:

### Health overview [#health-overview]

High-level assessment of workload health:

```
Your workload is healthy with 12 entities reporting normal status.
Response times are within expected ranges across all services.
No critical alerts are currently active.
```

### Performance trends [#performance-trends]

Analysis of key metrics over the selected time range:

```
Throughput increased 23% in the past hour while maintaining stable
response times. Error rate remains below 0.1% across all entities.
Database query performance shows slight improvement compared to
the previous hour.
```

### Entity highlights [#entity-highlights]

Callouts for specific entities requiring attention:

```
- payment-service: Response time increased 40ms (within SLA but worth monitoring)
- user-db: Connection pool utilization at 78%, approaching the 85% threshold
- checkout-api: Error rate below 0.1%, performing optimally
- inventory-service: Throughput dropped 15%, correlates with lower checkout activity
```

### Recommendations [#recommendations]

Suggested actions based on observed patterns:

```
- Investigate database connection pool trend. While not critical,
  usage may require scaling if traffic continues growing.
- Monitor payment-service response time. If the trend continues,
  consider reviewing recent changes or increasing resources.
- No immediate action required for error rates—all services
  operating within acceptable parameters.
```

## Best practices [#best-practices]

Get the most value from AI insights with these approaches:

### When to use insights [#when-to-use]

* **Start of investigation**: Generate insights first for a quick overview
* **After viewing data**: Review charts and metrics, then get AI analysis
* **During handoffs**: Include insights in status updates to other teams
* **For trend analysis**: Generate insights at regular intervals to track changes

### How to interpret insights [#how-to-interpret]

* **Verify observations**: AI insights suggest areas to investigate—always validate against actual data
* **Consider context**: AI doesn't know about planned maintenance, deployments, or business events
* **Use as starting point**: Insights highlight what to investigate, not definitive answers
* **Cross-reference KPIs**: If you've configured [custom KPIs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis), insights may reference them

### Regenerating insights [#regenerating]

* **After time range changes**: Get analysis for different periods
* **When data updates**: Refresh insights if waiting for recent deployment data
* **During incidents**: Regenerate as situation evolves to see new patterns
* **After filtering**: Generate new insights when focusing on specific entities

## Limitations [#limitations]

Be aware of these current limitations:

### Scope limitations [#scope-limitations]

* **Current data only**: Analyzes only currently displayed data on the workload page
* **Single workload**: Cannot correlate insights across multiple workloads
* **No account-wide context**: Doesn't access data from other workloads or accounts
* **Time range constrained**: Limited to the time range selected in the UI

### Analysis limitations [#analysis-limitations]

* **Observations, not diagnosis**: Provides insights about patterns, not root cause analysis
* **Pattern recognition**: May occasionally misinterpret complex or unusual patterns
* **No predictive analysis**: Focuses on current and recent past, not future predictions
* **Limited domain knowledge**: Doesn't understand your specific business logic or architecture

### Infrastructure limitations [#infra-limitations]

* **AWS only**: Not available on Azure infrastructure
* **FedRAMP unavailable**: Cannot be used in FedRAMP-compliant accounts
* **Processing time**: May take 10-20 seconds for complex workloads

<Callout variant="caution">
  Always verify AI insights against actual data before taking action. Insights are suggestions to guide investigation, not definitive diagnoses.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Button disabled [#button-disabled]

If the <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT> button is disabled:

**Possible reasons:**
* **Azure infrastructure**: AI insights are not supported on Azure
* **FedRAMP account**: AI features are disabled for FedRAMP compliance
* **Feature not available**: Your account doesn't have access to AI insights
* **Insufficient data**: Workload lacks the observability data needed for analysis

**Resolution:**
* Verify your infrastructure type (AWS required)
* Check if your account is FedRAMP-compliant
* Contact your account team to verify AI insights access
* Ensure workload entities are reporting data

### Generation fails [#generation-fails]

If insight generation starts but fails:

**Possible reasons:**
* **Insufficient data**: Not enough observability data to analyze
* **Temporary connectivity issue**: Brief service interruption
* **Complex workload data**: Analysis timed out on very large workloads
* **Service degradation**: Temporary AI service issues

**Resolution:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes and retry
2. Reduce time range to analyze less data
3. Check that entities are reporting recent data
4. If issue persists after multiple attempts, contact support

### Insights don't match expectations [#unexpected-insights]

If insights seem incorrect or miss important issues:

**Possible reasons:**
* **Time range mismatch**: Analysis period doesn't cover the issue
* **Entity filtering**: Important entities filtered out of view
* **Pattern complexity**: AI didn't recognize unusual but normal patterns
* **Context missing**: AI doesn't know about planned events or changes

**Resolution:**
* Adjust time range to cover the period of concern
* Remove entity filters to include all workload entities
* Generate multiple insights at different time ranges
* Add context manually when sharing insights with teams

### Insights take too long [#slow-generation]

If generation takes longer than 30 seconds:

**Possible reasons:**
* **Large workload**: Many entities and extensive data
* **Complex time range**: Long time periods require more analysis
* **Service load**: High demand on AI service

**Resolution:**
* Reduce time range to past hour or day
* Wait for generation to complete (may take up to 60 seconds)
* Try again during off-peak hours
* Contact support if consistently slow
