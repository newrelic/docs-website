<Callout variant="important">
  Advanced workloads are in **Public Preview** and available to select customers.
</Callout>

Advanced workloads automatically discover and track entities based on transaction flows. They use distributed tracing to continuously update membership as your system evolves, eliminating manual maintenance.
