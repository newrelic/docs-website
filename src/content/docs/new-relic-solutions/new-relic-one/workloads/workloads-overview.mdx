Workloads help you organize, monitor, and troubleshoot your entire technology stack by grouping related entities into business-relevant units. Instead of tracking dozens of services, hosts, and applications separately, workloads give you a unified view of everything that powers a specific business function, team, or customer experience.

## Why use workloads? [#value-prop]

Modern applications span multiple services, hosts, databases, and third-party dependencies. Workloads solve the challenge of monitoring complex, distributed systems by:

* **Simplifying observability**: View health and performance across your entire stack in one place
* **Accelerating troubleshooting**: Quickly identify which components are causing issues
* **Improving collaboration**: Share system status with teams without requiring deep technical knowledge
* **Aligning to business outcomes**: Group entities by business function, customer journey, or team responsibility

## What you can include in workloads [#what-included]

Both workload types can include:

* Any New Relic-monitored entity (applications, services, hosts, databases, etc.)
* [Dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards)
* Other workloads (useful for complex team structures)

**Standard workloads** let you manually select these entities or define dynamic queries.

**Intelligent workloads** automatically include all entities participating in the selected transaction flow.

## Types of workloads [#types]

New Relic offers two types of workloads, each designed for different use cases:

      You manually define which entities belong to the workload using queries, tags, or by selecting specific entities. Membership updates when your queries match new entities or you manually add/remove them.

      ### Key capabilities

      * **Entity discovery**: Manual or tag-based queries
      * **Membership updates**: When queries match new entities or manual changes
      * **Setup complexity**: Simple - select entities or write queries
      * **Health status**: Configurable rules
      * **Alerting**: On workload status

    <TabsPageItem id="Intelligent-workloads">

      Automatically discovers and tracks entities based on distributed traces from Transaction 360. Membership updates every 5 minutes as your system evolves, with AI insights and custom KPIs available.

      ### Key capabilities

      * **Entity discovery**: Automatic via Transaction 360
      * **Membership updates**: Every 5 minutes automatically
      * **Setup complexity**: Requires Transaction 360 and distributed tracing
      * **AI insights**: Provides performance analysis and investigation for the workloads (AWS infrastructure only, not available on Azure or for FedRAMP customers)
      * **Custom KPIs**: Define and track custom KPIs based on your unique business needs
      * **Health status**: Configurable rules
      * **Alerting**: On workload status and KPIs
      * **Availability**: Public Preview

      ### Requirements

      To use Intelligent workloads, you need:

      * **Transaction 360**: Must be enabled with [distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) in your New Relic account
      * **Trace data**: Recent distributed traces for the transactions you want to monitor
      * **Permissions**: Ability to create and manage workloads in your account

      **AI insights additional requirements:**
      * **AWS infrastructure only**: Not available on Azure environments
      * **Not available to FedRAMP customers**: Due to AI processing requirements

      ### When to use Intelligent workloads

      Intelligent workloads are ideal for:
      * **Critical business transactions** with dynamic architectures
      * **Complex dependencies** where entity participation changes frequently
      * **Scenarios requiring business outcome tracking** with custom KPIs
      * **Teams needing AI-powered insights** for faster troubleshooting
