Workloads help you organize, monitor, and troubleshoot your entire technology stack by grouping related entities into business-relevant units. Instead of tracking dozens of services, hosts, and applications separately, workloads give you a unified view of everything that powers a specific business function, team, or customer experience.

## Why use workloads? [#value-prop]

Modern applications span multiple services, hosts, databases, and third-party dependencies. Workloads solve the challenge of monitoring complex, distributed systems by:

* **Simplifying observability**: View health and performance across your entire stack in one place
* **Accelerating troubleshooting**: Quickly identify which components are causing issues
* **Improving collaboration**: Share system status with teams without requiring deep technical knowledge
* **Aligning to business outcomes**: Group entities by business function, customer journey, or team responsibility

## Types of workloads [#types]

New Relic offers two types of workloads, each designed for different use cases:

## Choosing the right workload type [#choose]

Use this guide to select the best workload type for your needs:

### Choose Standard workloads when:

* You have a stable architecture with known dependencies
* You want complete control over entity membership
* Your team already uses tags to organize entities
* You need simple, straightforward setup
* You're monitoring infrastructure, static groups, or microservices

**Example use cases:**
* Production environment for a specific application team
* All databases supporting your e-commerce platform
* Infrastructure hosts in a particular region
* Frontend applications and their APIs

### Choose Intelligent workloads when:

* You're monitoring critical business transactions
* Your architecture changes frequently
* You need automatic discovery of new entities
* You want AI-powered insights into performance
* You're tracking complex, distributed workflows

**Example use cases:**
* Complete checkout flow from frontend to payment processing
* User authentication journey across multiple services
* Order fulfillment process from API to warehouse systems
* Data pipeline processing with dynamic scaling

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can use both types! Many organizations use Standard workloads for infrastructure and Intelligent workloads for critical business transactions.
</Callout>

## What you can include in workloads [#what-included]

Both workload types can include:

* Any New Relic-monitored entity (applications, services, hosts, databases, etc.)
* [Dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards)
* Other workloads (useful for complex team structures)

**Standard workloads** let you manually select these entities or define dynamic queries.

**Intelligent workloads** automatically include all entities participating in the selected transaction flow.

## Common workload features [#common-features]

Both workload types provide:

* **Unified health status**: Single view of system health across all entities
* **Customizable alerting**: Configure notifications for workload status changes
* **Activity tracking**: View deployments, incidents, and configuration changes
* **Team collaboration**: Share workload status and context with stakeholders
* **Maps and visualizations**: Understand entity relationships and dependencies
