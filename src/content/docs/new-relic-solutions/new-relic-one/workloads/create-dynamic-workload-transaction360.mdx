<Callout variant="important">
  Dynamic workloads are currently in **Public Preview**. This feature is being gradually rolled out and may not be available to all accounts yet.
</Callout>

Transaction 360 provides powerful ad-hoc views of your transaction flows, but these views are ephemeral. By converting a Transaction 360 view into a dynamic workload, you can monitor the transaction continuously, configure alerts, and track changes over time.

## Before you begin [#prereqs]

Before creating a dynamic workload, ensure:

* You have [distributed tracing enabled](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for the services you want to monitor
* You have access to Transaction 360 views in New Relic
* You have permissions to create workloads in your account

## Create a dynamic workload from Transaction 360 [#create-from-t360]

There are two ways to create dynamic workloads from Transaction 360 views:

### From a Transaction 360 view [#from-t360-view]

When viewing a Transaction 360 flow:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>
2. Select a service and navigate to a transaction
3. In the Transaction 360 view, click <DNT>**Save as dynamic workload**</DNT>
4. In the stacked view that appears:
   * Enter a meaningful name for your workload
   * Review the account where the workload will be saved (auto-populated based on the transaction's account)
   * Optionally add a description
5. Click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>

The system will create a dynamic workload that includes all entities participating in the selected transaction.

### From a standard transaction drilldown [#from-transaction-drilldown]

You can also create dynamic workloads from standard transaction pages:

1. Navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>
2. Select a service
3. In the left navigation, click <DNT>**Transactions**</DNT>
4. Select a transaction from the list
5. Click <DNT>**Save as dynamic workload**</DNT>
6. Complete the workload details and click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>

## View an existing dynamic workload [#view-workload]

After creating a dynamic workload:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>
2. Find your workload in the list (you can filter by **Type: Dynamic**)
3. Click on the workload name to open it

The workload view includes:

* **Summary page**: Shows the Transaction 360 view as the primary summary interface, providing the full transaction flow visualization
* **Entity details**: Lists all entities in the workload with their health status and key metrics
* **Health status**: Overall workload health based on entity status
* **Activity**: Recent events, deployments, and configuration changes

## Navigate from Transaction 360 to an existing workload [#navigate-from-t360]

If you've already saved a Transaction 360 view as a dynamic workload, the button changes to help you navigate:

1. When viewing a Transaction 360 that has been saved as a dynamic workload, you'll see a <DNT>**View dynamic workload**</DNT> button at the top of the page
2. Click the button to navigate directly to the saved workload

This makes it easy to switch between ad-hoc exploration and monitoring your saved workloads.

## How entity membership is updated [#membership-updates]

Dynamic workloads automatically refresh their entity membership:

* **Update frequency**: Every 5 minutes
* **Discovery method**: The system analyzes recent distributed traces for the selected transaction
* **Automatic additions**: New entities that participate in the transaction are automatically added
* **Automatic removals**: Entities that no longer participate are automatically removed
* **Historical tracking**: Changes to membership are logged (feature coming soon)

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you notice entities are missing or shouldn't be included, verify that distributed tracing is properly configured and that the transaction is generating recent trace data.
</Callout>

## Manage dynamic workloads [#manage]

### View membership changes

To see which entities are currently in your dynamic workload:

1. Open your dynamic workload
2. Navigate to the <DNT>**Entity details**</DNT> page
3. Review the list of entities, their types, and health status

### Configure health status

You can configure how workload health is calculated:

1. Open your dynamic workload
2. Go to <DNT>**Health status > Configuration**</DNT>
3. Choose how entity health should roll up to workload health
4. Save your configuration

Learn more about [workload status configuration](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration).

### Create alerts

To create alerts for your dynamic workload:

1. Open your dynamic workload
2. Click <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>
3. Configure your alert based on:
   * Overall workload health status
   * Specific entity metrics within the workload
   * Custom NRQL queries against workload entities

### Edit or delete a workload

To modify or remove a dynamic workload:

1. Go to the workloads list
2. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon next to the workload name
3. Select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT> to change the name or description, or <DNT>**Delete**</DNT> to remove it

<Callout variant="important">
  Deleting a dynamic workload does not affect the underlying entities or the original transaction. It only removes the workload grouping.
</Callout>

## Limitations [#limitations]

When working with dynamic workloads, note:

* **One transaction per workload**: Each dynamic workload tracks a single transaction
* **Update frequency**: Membership updates every 5 minutes (not configurable during preview)
* **Manual entity additions**: You cannot manually add or remove entities from dynamic workloads (they're determined by transaction traces)
* **Cross-account entities**: Entities must be in the same account as the workload

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Missing entities in the workload

If expected entities are missing from your dynamic workload:

1. **Verify distributed tracing**: Ensure distributed tracing is enabled and working for all services
2. **Check trace data**: Confirm the transaction has recent trace data showing the missing entities
3. **Wait for update**: Membership updates occur every 5 minutes; wait for the next refresh cycle
4. **Review entity access**: Ensure you have permissions to view all entities in your account

### Workload membership not updating

If your workload membership seems stale:

1. Verify the transaction is still receiving traffic
2. Check that distributed tracing is collecting recent trace data
3. Review the transaction's trace data to confirm entity participation
4. Contact New Relic support if the issue persists after 15 minutes
