  Dynamic workloads are currently in **Public Preview** and available to select customers. This feature is being gradually rolled out and may not be available to all accounts yet.
</Callout>

Dynamic workloads extend New Relic's workload capabilities by automatically discovering and tracking entities based on real transaction flows through your system. Unlike standard workloads that require manual entity selection or tag-based queries, dynamic workloads continuously update their membership based on the services and infrastructure components participating in critical business transactions.

## What are dynamic workloads? [#definition]

Dynamic workloads are intelligent, self-updating collections of entities that automatically track the full scope of components involved in a specific transaction or business flow. By leveraging distributed tracing data, dynamic workloads provide a living map of your system's dependencies that evolves as your architecture changes.

Key differences from standard workloads:

## Benefits of dynamic workloads [#benefits]

Dynamic workloads help you:

* **Reduce manual maintenance**: Entity membership automatically updates as services are added, removed, or modified
* **Improve visibility**: See the complete transaction flow including downstream dependencies that might be missed with manual configuration
* **Accelerate troubleshooting**: Quickly understand the full scope of components affected by performance issues
* **Monitor business-critical flows**: Focus on the health of specific transactions that matter most to your business
* **Get AI-powered insights**: Generate contextual summaries to understand workload health and trends (preview feature)

## Use cases [#use-cases]

Dynamic workloads are ideal for:

* **High-throughput transactions**: Monitor critical business flows like checkout processes, payment processing, or user authentication
* **Microservices architectures**: Track complex distributed systems where services frequently change
* **Multi-tier applications**: Observe full-stack health from frontend applications through backend services to databases and infrastructure
* **Ephemeral infrastructure**: Monitor systems with frequently changing containers, serverless functions, or auto-scaling components
* **Transaction 360 monitoring**: Convert ad-hoc Transaction 360 views into persistent, monitored workloads

## How dynamic workloads work [#how-it-works]

Dynamic workloads use distributed tracing data to discover entity relationships:

1. **Transaction selection**: You identify a specific transaction to monitor (for example, from Transaction 360 views)
2. **Entity discovery**: New Relic analyzes distributed traces to identify all services, applications, databases, and infrastructure participating in that transaction
3. **Workload creation**: The system creates a workload containing all discovered entities
4. **Automatic updates**: Every 5 minutes, the system re-evaluates transaction flows and updates workload membership
5. **Health monitoring**: Workload health is calculated based on the status of all member entities

## Requirements and limitations [#requirements]

### Requirements

* Distributed tracing must be enabled for the services you want to monitor
* Transactions must have sufficient trace data for entity discovery
* New Relic account with workloads access

### Current limitations

<Callout variant="important">
  During Public Preview, the following limitations apply:
</Callout>

* **Regional availability**: AI-powered insights are only available for customers on AWS infrastructure (not Azure)
* **Compliance restrictions**: AI summary features are unavailable to FedRAMP customers
* **Update frequency**: Workload membership updates every 5 minutes (not configurable)
* **Transaction scope**: One transaction per dynamic workload

## Workload types in the UI [#workload-types]

In the workloads list, you'll see a **Type** column that distinguishes between workload types:

* **Standard**: Traditional workloads with manual or tag-based entity selection
* **Dynamic**: Transaction-based workloads with automatic membership updates

You can filter the workloads list by type to quickly find your dynamic workloads.
