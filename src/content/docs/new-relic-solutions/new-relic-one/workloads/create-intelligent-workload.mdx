<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Intelligent workload automatically tracks all entities in your transaction flow using distributed tracing. Unlike [standard workload](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads), intelligent workload uses distributed tracing to discover entities and updates membership every 5 minutes as your system evolves.

## Before you begin [#prereqs]

Ensure you meet the [Intelligent workload requirements](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're new to workload, review [Workload overview](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview) to understand when to use Intelligent vs. Standard workload.
</Callout>

## Create intelligent workloads [#create]

You can create an intelligent workload in three different ways. Choose the method that's most convenient for your workflow:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="create-from-recommendations"
    title="Create from recommended workloads"
  >

New Relic automatically analyzes your application transactions and recommends high-value Intelligent Workloads to create. This is the fastest way to get started with Intelligent Workloads.

### View recommendations

When you navigate to the Workloads page, you'll see a banner at the top if New Relic has found recommended workloads for you:

```
We found [X] recommended Intelligent Workloads. We made it easy to review our recommendations and set up Intelligent Workloads quickly.
```

Click <DNT>**Review recommendations**</DNT> to open the recommendations modal.

### Review and create from recommendations

The **Recommended Intelligent Workloads** modal shows transactions that would benefit from monitoring:

1. **Filter by category**: Use the tabs to switch between:
   - **Key Transactions**: High-traffic or business-critical transactions
   - **Impacted Transactions**: Transactions with performance issues or errors

2. **Sort recommendations**: Use the dropdown to sort by:
   - Highest error rate
   - Slowest average response time
   - Most time consuming
 

3. **Review transaction details**: Each recommendation shows:
   - **Transaction name**: The focal transaction for the workload
   - **Focal entity**: The primary service handling the transaction
   - **Response Time**: Average latency (e.g., "0.57s")
   - **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests (e.g., "0.6%")
   - **Total Duration**: Combined processing time (e.g., "77.60s")

4. **Create workload**: Click <DNT>**Create**</DNT> next to any recommendation

When you create from a recommendation, New Relic automatically pre-fills the entity and transaction selection, taking you directly to the **Add details** step where you can:
- Name your workload
- Add a description (optional)
- Verify the focal service and transaction
- Complete the setup

<Callout variant="tip">
  Creating from recommendations is ideal when you're new to Intelligent Workloads or want to quickly identify which transactions would benefit most from dedicated monitoring.

The Workload page provides a guided setup wizard to help you create Intelligent workload:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>.
2. Click <DNT>**Create a workload**</DNT>.
3. Select <DNT>**Intelligent Workload**</DNT> type.
4. Click <DNT>**Setup**</DNT> to start the wizard.

  alt="Screenshot showing workload type selection with Standard and Intelligent options"

/>

### Step 1: Select an entity [#select-entity]

Choose the service or entity that contains your critical transaction:

1. Search or browse for the entity by name.
2. Filter by entity type if needed (APM services, browser apps, etc.).
3. Select the entity that processes your key transaction.
4. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Choose an entity that is central to your transaction flow. For example, if monitoring a checkout process, select the checkout service rather than a peripheral logging service.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Pick your transaction [#pick-transaction]

Select the specific transaction you want to monitor:

1. Browse the list of transactions for the selected entity
2. Use search to find specific transaction names
3. Select the transaction that represents your business workflow
4. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>

The workload will track all entities that participate in this transaction based on distributed traces.

### Step 3: Add details [#add-details]

Provide information about your workload:

1. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Checkout Transaction", "User Authentication Flow")
2. **Description** (optional): Add context about what this workload monitors and why it matters
3. **Account**: Select the account where the workload will be created
4. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>

### Step 4: Preview & finalize [#preview-finalize]

Review your workload configuration:

1. Verify the **Focal service** is correct
2. Confirm the **Focal transaction** matches your intended workflow
3. Review the workload **Name** and **Description**
4. Click <DNT>**Create Workload**</DNT>

Your Intelligent workload will immediately begin tracking entities participating in the transaction.

    id="create-from-t360"
    title="Create from Transaction 360"
  >

If you're already viewing a transaction in Transaction 360, you can quickly save it as an Intelligent workload:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>
2. Select a service that's part of your critical transaction flow

<img
  title="Select entity for Intelligent Workload"
  alt="Screenshot showing entity selection step in Intelligent Workload creation"
  src="/images/intelligent-workload-select-entity.webp"
/>


3. Navigate to a specific transaction you want to monitor and click <DNT>**Transaction 360**</DNT>.
4. Click <DNT>**Save as intelligent workload**</DNT>.
5. Enter a descriptive name for the workload.
7. Click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Choose transaction names that represent complete business workflows (e.g., "checkout", "user-authentication") rather than individual API calls.
