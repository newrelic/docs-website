<Callout variant="important">
  Intelligent workloads are in **Public Preview**.
</Callout>

Convert Transaction 360 views into continuously monitored Intelligent workloads that automatically track all entities in your transaction flow. Unlike [Standard workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads), Intelligent workloads use distributed tracing to discover entities and update membership every 5 minutes as your system evolves.

## Before you begin [#prereqs]

Ensure you meet the [Intelligent workload requirements](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workloads#requirements).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're new to workloads, review [Workloads overview](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview) to understand when to use Intelligent vs. Standard workloads.
</Callout>

## Create from Transaction 360 [#create]

Transaction 360 provides a detailed view of a transaction's flow through your system. You can save any Transaction 360 view as an Intelligent workload:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>
2. Select a service that's part of your critical transaction flow

7. Click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>

<Callout variant="tip">
  Choose transaction names that represent complete business workflows (e.g., "checkout", "user-authentication") rather than individual API calls.
</Callout>

### Alternative: Create from Transactions page [#create-from-list]

You can also save a transaction as an Intelligent workload directly from the Transactions list:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>
2. Select a service
3. Click <DNT>**Transactions**</DNT>
4. Find the transaction you want to monitor
5. Click <DNT>**Save as intelligent workload**</DNT>

## View existing Intelligent workloads [#view]

After creating Intelligent workloads, you can access them from the main Workloads page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>
2. Use the <DNT>**Type**</DNT> filter to select **Intelligent**
3. Click a workload to open its dashboard

### Understanding workload pages [#understanding-pages]

Intelligent workloads provide multiple views, each displaying different aspects of your transaction flow. While the pages may appear similar, they contain distinct data:

#### Summary (Transaction 360)

The default view that shows:
* **Transaction flow visualization**: Complete path through all services and dependencies
* **Workload KPIs**: Custom business metrics defined for this workload
* **AI insights banner**: Access to generate AI-powered health summaries
* **Workload metrics**: Health status timeline and overall performance
* **Golden metrics**: Key performance charts scoped to the focal transaction

This page focuses on transaction-level observability, showing how requests flow through your system.

#### Entity Details

Provides entity-centric information:
* **Entity list**: All services, databases, and infrastructure in the workload
* **Entity health**: Individual status for each participating entity
* **Entity metrics**: Performance data specific to each entity
* **Entity relationships**: Dependencies and connections between entities

Use this page when troubleshooting specific services or understanding which entities are impacting workload health.

#### Activity

Shows temporal events and changes:
* **Deployments**: Recent code deployments across workload entities
* **Configuration changes**: Infrastructure or service configuration updates
* **Incidents**: Active and resolved alert incidents
* **Anomalies**: Detected performance anomalies
* **Activity timeline**: Chronological view of all events

This page helps correlate performance changes with deployments, configuration updates, or incidents.

### What you'll see [#workload-view]

When you open an Intelligent workload, you'll see:

<img

### Navigate from Transaction 360 [#nav-from-tx]

When viewing a saved Transaction 360, you'll see a link to open the corresponding Intelligent workload:

* Look for the <DNT>**View intelligent workload**</DNT> button at the top of the Transaction 360 view
* Click it to jump directly to the workload dashboard

## Manage your Intelligent workloads [#manage]

### Configure health status [#configure-health]

Set up rules that determine when your workload is operational, degraded, or disrupted:

1. Open your Intelligent workload
2. Go to <DNT>**Health status**</DNT> tab
3. Click <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT>
4. Choose a health roll-up method:
   * <DNT>**Roll up the worst status**</DNT>: Workload status matches the most critical entity
   * <DNT>**Roll up the best status**</DNT>: Workload is operational as long as one entity is healthy
5. Save your configuration

See [Workload status configuration](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration) for detailed guidance.

### Create alerts [#create-alerts]

Configure alerts to notify your team when the workload becomes unhealthy:

1. Open your Intelligent workload
2. Click <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>
3. Choose what to alert on:
   * **Workload health status**: Alert when workload enters degraded or disrupted state
   * **Entity metrics**: Alert on specific entity performance thresholds
   * **Custom NRQL queries**: Alert on any data across the workload
4. Configure thresholds and notification channels
5. Save the alert condition

See [Workload status notifications](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-views-notifications) for alerting best practices.

### Edit or delete workloads [#edit-delete]

To modify or remove an Intelligent workload:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>
2. Find the workload in the list
3. Click <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> next to the workload name
4. Select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT> or <DNT>**Delete**</DNT>

<Callout variant="caution">
  When you edit an Intelligent workload, you can change its name and description, but you cannot change the transaction it monitors. To track a different transaction, create a new workload.
</Callout>

## How entity membership updates [#updates]

Understanding how Intelligent workloads maintain their entity lists helps you troubleshoot and optimize monitoring:

### Update process [#update-process]

* **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
* **Method**: Analyzes recent distributed traces for the selected transaction
* **Automatic changes**:
  * **Adds** new entities that appear in traces
  * **Removes** entities no longer participating in the transaction
  * **Retains** entities temporarily missing due to intermittent traffic

### What triggers updates [#triggers]

Entity membership changes when:

* You deploy new services that handle the transaction
* You retire or remove services from production
* Your architecture changes (e.g., new databases, caching layers)
* Traffic patterns reveal previously unseen entity participation

<Callout variant="tip">
  Entity changes appear within 5-10 minutes of deployment. If you don't see expected entities after 15 minutes, see the troubleshooting section below.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Missing entities [#missing-entities]

If entities that should be in your workload aren't appearing:

1. **Verify distributed tracing**: Ensure tracing is enabled for the missing service
   ```bash
   # Check if service has recent trace data
   FROM Span SELECT count(*) WHERE service.name = 'YOUR_SERVICE_NAME' SINCE 15 minutes ago
   ```

2. **Check trace data**: Confirm the entity participates in the transaction
   * Open Transaction 360 for the workload's transaction
   * Look for the entity in the trace waterfall

3. **Wait for update cycle**: Entity membership updates every 5 minutes

4. **Verify permissions**: Ensure you have access to all entities in the trace

5. **Confirm entity type support**: Intelligent workloads include entities captured in distributed traces (applications, services, databases, external services)

### Stale membership [#stale-membership]

If the workload isn't updating with recent architecture changes:

1. **Confirm transaction has traffic**: Check that the transaction is actively receiving requests
   ```sql
   FROM Transaction SELECT count(*)
   WHERE name = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_NAME'
   SINCE 15 minutes ago
   ```

2. **Verify trace collection**: Ensure traces are being captured for recent requests
   ```sql
   FROM Span SELECT count(*)
   WHERE transaction.name = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_NAME'
   SINCE 15 minutes ago
   ```

3. **Wait 15 minutes**: Allow time for multiple update cycles to complete

4. **Check entity access**: Verify you have permissions for all entities in the updated architecture

5. **Contact support**: If membership is still stale after 30 minutes, reach out to New Relic support

### Workload creation fails [#creation-fails]

If you can't create an Intelligent workload:

* **Verify Transaction 360 access**: Ensure your account has access to Transaction 360 features
* **Check distributed tracing**: Confirm tracing is enabled and collecting data
* **Validate permissions**: Ensure you have workload creation permissions in your account
* **Review trace data**: Make sure the transaction has recent traces (within the last 24 hours)
