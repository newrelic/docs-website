<Callout variant="important">
  AI insights are in **Public Preview** with specific availability requirements.
</Callout>

AI insights provide AI-powered summaries of your workload's health, performance trends, and potential issues.

## Requirements [#requirements]

* Intelligent workload created
* Sufficient observability data
* **AWS infrastructure only** (not available on Azure)
* **Not available to FedRAMP customers**

## Generate insights [#generate]

1. Open your intelligent workload
2. Click <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT>
3. Review the AI-generated summary

Insights analyze only data visible on your workload page and are generated on-demand.

## What insights include [#what-included]

**Health overview:**
```
Your workload is healthy with 12 entities reporting normal status.
Response times are within expected ranges.
```

**Performance trends:**
```
Throughput increased 23% in the past hour while maintaining stable
response times.
```

**Entity highlights:**
```
- payment-service: Response time +40ms (within SLA)
- user-db: Connection pool at 78%, approaching threshold
- checkout-api: Error rate below 0.1%, optimal
```

**Recommendations:**
```
Investigate database connection pool trend. While not critical,
usage may require scaling if traffic continues growing.
```

## Best practices [#best-practices]

* Generate insights when first viewing a workload or after alerts
* Verify AI observations against actual metrics
* Use insights as starting point, not replacement for analysis
* Regenerate after significant changes

## Limitations [#limitations]

* Analyzes only currently displayed data
* Cannot access other workloads or accounts
* Provides observations, not root cause analysis
* May occasionally misinterpret complex patterns

<Callout variant="caution">
  Always verify AI insights against actual data before taking action.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Button disabled

**Reasons:**
* Azure infrastructure (not supported)

**Resolution:** Contact your account team to verify infrastructure and feature access.

### Generation fails

**Reasons:**
* Insufficient data
* Temporary connectivity issue
* Complex workload data

**Resolution:** Wait and retry. If issue persists, contact support.
