Standard workload lets you manually group related entities using queries, tags, or explicit selection. This doc explains how to create and configure a standard workload. If you need automatic entity discovery based on distributed traces, see [intelligent workload](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads) instead.

The entities you add to a Standard workload depend on your goals and organization structure. You can also read about how workloads align teams in our [Workloads tutorial](/docs/tutorial-peak-demand/organize-data-workloads).

## Accounts and permissions [#accounts]

There are two kinds of accounts that contribute to workloads: the  <DNT>**workload account**</DNT> and the <DNT>**scope accounts**</DNT>. If your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) has more than one account, differentiating between the workload and scope accounts will make managing your workloads easier.

* The <DNT>**workload account**</DNT> is where the workload and its data lives. The account used to create a workload, then, is considered the workload account. This account determines which users can see and manage the workload, based on what account permissions they've been assigned.
* The <DNT>**scope accounts**</DNT> are accounts that the workload fetches telemetry data from. Users without access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see all the data in a workload. For team members who use a workload, ensure you add your team's relevant accounts that workload pulls data from.

Once created, the workload account can't be changed.Scope accounts, however, can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.

## Create Standard workloads [#create]

Standard workloads give you full control over which entities to include. You define membership using entity queries, tags, or by selecting specific entities. Unlike [Intelligent workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-intelligent-workload) that automatically discover entities from traces, Standard workloads update only when your queries match new entities or you manually modify them.

There are a few different ways you can create Standard workloads, though the one you choose is entirely up to you. We recommend choosing the method that's most convenient for aligning your teams.

    </figcaption>

    Here's how to create a Standard workload from the workloads UI:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>, and then click <DNT>**+ Create a workload**</DNT>.
    2. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team.
    3. From the <DNT>**Select an account**</DNT> dropdown, select the [workload account](#accounts) you'd like to use.
    4. Click [Choose the scope accounts](#scope-accounts) to check all of the accounts this workload will use data from.
    5. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload.

       * You can search by entity type, [tags](#tags), or [attributes](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary#attribute) (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region).
       * Click <DNT>**+ Add this query**</DNT> to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes.
       * Click <DNT>**+ Add**</DNT> next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes.
    6. You can add both queries and specific entities to the workload, which work together according to the [query logic](#query-logic).
    7. Click <DNT>**Create a workload**</DNT> to save it.

    If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can [set filters on those dashboard links](#filter-dashboards).

## Define your workloads [#define]

Below are some details and tips about some aspects of defining workloads:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="tags"
    title="Use tags to define the workload content"
  >
    You can query and select workload entities using both [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and [attributes](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary#attribute). Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the [tagging docs](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and watching [this video about using tags to define a workload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXCH_3XjGkQ).

  <Collapser
    id="query-logic"
    title="How the dynamic query logic works"
  >
    You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload.

    * Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator.
    * Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator.
    * You can wrap strings between percent signs (`%`) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, `<team>-<env>-<appName>`), consider using [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, `team:awesome`, `env:production`).
    * We recommend not to use percent signs (`%`) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface.

    id="add-dashboards"
    title="Add dashboards to workloads"
  >
    If you have [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> from your workload.

    To add dashboards to a workload: After you've created a workload, go to the <DNT>**Activity**</DNT> page for a workload and click <DNT>**Add dashboard**</DNT>.
