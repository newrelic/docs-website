</Callout>

Intelligent workload UI provides comprehensive views to monitor transaction flows, track custom KPIs, and understand workload health. This page walks through the UI from a user's perspective, explaining each component and how to use it effectively.

This page describes the UI for [intelligent workload](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads). For [standard workload](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads), see the [standard workload UI](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads) documentation.

## Access intelligent workload [#access]

After creating Intelligent workloads, you can access them from the main Workloads page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**</DNT>
2. Use the <DNT>**Type**</DNT> filter to select **Intelligent**
3. Click a workload to open its dashboard

## Summary page (top to bottom) [#summary-page]

The Summary page is the default view and provides a complete overview of your workload's health and performance. Here's what you'll see from top to bottom:

### 1. AI insights banner [#ai-insights-banner]

At the very top of the Summary page, you'll see a blue banner announcing:

```
AI insights available for this workload [Generate insights button]
```

Click <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT> to view the AI-generated performance analysis, and investigation suggestions based on your workload data.

<Callout variant="tip">
  AI insights are only available on AWS infrastructure and not for FedRAMP customers. If you don't see this banner, check your [infrastructure requirements](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#intelligent-workloads).
</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution">
  Always verify AI insights against actual data before taking action. Insights are suggestions to guide investigation, not definitive diagnoses.
</Callout>

### 2. Workload KPIs [#workload-kpis]

Below the AI banner, you'll find the KPI tiles section showing custom business metrics:

<img
  title="Intelligent Workload summary with KPIs"
  alt="Screenshot showing Intelligent Workload summary page with KPIs, metrics, and AI insights banner"
  src="/images/intelligent-workload-summary-kpis.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**Workload KPIs:**</DNT> Custom business metrics displayed with current values and trend indicators.
</figcaption>

Each KPI tile displays:
* **KPI name**: The descriptive name you assigned (e.g., "Workload P99 latency", "Workload success rate")
* **Current value**: Real-time measurement (e.g., "0.215", "61.7k")
* **Trend indicator**: Percentage change with up/down arrow (e.g., "↑7.7%", "↓1.8%")
* **Actions menu** (...): Options to edit, hide, or create alerts for this KPI

**What you can do**:
* **View all KPIs**: Click <DNT>**View all KPIs**</DNT> in the top right to see your complete KPI catalog
* **Add KPIs**: Click <DNT>**+ Add new KPI**</DNT> to create additional metrics
* **Manage KPIs**: Navigate to Settings > Manage KPI to organize, edit, or delete KPIs

**Note**: You can display up to 8 KPIs on the summary page at once. Default KPIs include P99 Response Time and Success Rate for your focal transaction.

[Learn more about managing KPIs →](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis)

### 3. Workload metrics (Health status) [#health-status]

Below the KPI tiles, you'll find the Workload metrics section showing overall health status. For more on configuring health status, see [Workload status configuration](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration).

### 4. Golden metrics (Scoped to focal transaction) [#golden-metrics]

Three side-by-side charts showing key performance indicators scoped specifically to your focal transaction:

#### Response Time
* Displays latency trends for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Response time documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-response-time).


#### Throughput
* Displays request volume for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Throughput documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-throughput).

#### Errors
* Displays error count for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Errors documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-errors).


**Why these matter**: These charts are automatically scoped to your focal transaction, giving you immediate visibility into the health of your specific business workflow without needing to filter through all entity data.

### 5. Participating entities [#participating-entities-section]

The bottom section shows performance metrics for all entities participating in your transaction:

<img
  title="Participating entities and Dynamic Flow Map"
  alt="Screenshot showing participating entities charts and Dynamic Flow Map visualization"
  src="/images/intelligent-workload-entities-flow-map.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**Participating entities:**</DNT> View performance metrics for all entities in your transaction flow.
</figcaption>

Three charts showing entity-level metrics:

#### Response Time (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Latency for up to 20 services handling your transaction
* **Multiple lines**: Each colored line represents a different service
* **Use case**: Identify which services are slowest and contributing to overall latency

#### Throughput (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Request volume handled by each service
* **Use case**: See which services handle the most requests in your transaction flow

#### Error Rate (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Error rates for each participating service
* **Use case**: Pinpoint which services are generating errors

**Why this matters**: While golden metrics show the focal transaction's performance, participating entities charts reveal which specific services in your distributed system are causing issues. This helps you quickly drill down to the root cause during troubleshooting.


### Errors [#errors]

The Errors page provides a centralized view of all errors occurring across your workload. For more on New Relic error tracking, see [Errors inbox documentation](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox).

When your workload health degrades, check the Errors page first to see if error rates spiked and which services are affected.


## Monitor section [#monitor]

The Monitor section provides different lenses to view your workload data.

### Transaction360 [#transaction360]

Transaction360 visualizes the complete distributed trace for your focal transaction. For more on Transaction360, see [Transaction360 documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/transaction360).

When troubleshooting slow transactions or errors, use Transaction360 to see exactly which service calls are slow or failing.

### Entity details [#entity-details]

The Entity details page lists all entities participating in your workload. For more on entities, see [Learn about entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic).

When you know there's a problem but aren't sure which service is causing it, scan the Entity details page to find unhealthy entities.

### Activity [#activity]

The Activity page provides a timeline of significant events affecting your workload. For more on activity tracking, see [Activity feed documentation](/docs/activity-feed/activity-feed-introduction).

When investigating incidents, use the Activity page to correlate deployments or changes with performance issues.

### Maps [#maps]

The Maps page visualizes service dependencies within your workload. For more on service maps, see [Service maps documentation](/docs/service-maps/service-maps-introduction).

When diagnosing cascading failures or understanding complex dependencies, use the Maps view to see how services interact within your workload.


### Change tracking [#change-tracking]

The Change tracking page logs deployments and configuration changes impacting your workload. For more on change tracking, see [Change tracking documentation](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction).

When performance degrades, check Change tracking to see if recent deployments or config changes might be the cause.
## Reports section [#reports]

The Reports section provides performance tracking and compliance views.

### Service levels [#service-levels]

The Service levels page lets you define and monitor SLOs and SLIs for your workload. For more on service levels, see [Service levels documentation](/docs/service-levels/service-levels-introduction).

## Settings section [#settings]

The Settings section lets you configure workload behavior.

### Configure health status [#configure-health-settings]

Set up health roll-up rules for your workload. For more on configuring health status, see [Workload status configuration](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration).

### Manage KPI [#manage-kpi-settings]

Create and edit custom KPIs for your workload. For more on managing KPIs, see [Manage custom KPIs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis).
