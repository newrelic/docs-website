## Summary page (top to bottom) [#summary-page]

The Summary page is the default view and provides a complete overview of your workload's health and performance. Here's what you'll see from top to bottom:

### 1. AI insights banner [#ai-insights-banner]

At the very top of the Summary page, you'll see a blue banner announcing:

```
AI insights available for this workload [Generate insights button]
```

Click <DNT>**Generate insights**</DNT> to view the AI-generated performance analysis, and investigation suggestions based on your workload data.

<Callout variant="important">
  **Requirements for AI insights:**
  * New Relic AI must be opted-in for your account. [Learn how to enable New Relic AI](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai)
  * AI insights generation incurs additional costs based on your New Relic AI usage
  * Only available on AWS infrastructure and not for FedRAMP customers
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">

</Callout>

<Callout variant="caution">
  Always verify AI insights against actual data before taking action. Insights are suggestions to guide investigation, not definitive diagnoses.
</Callout>

### 2. Workload KPIs [#workload-kpis]

Below the AI banner, you'll find the KPI tiles section showing custom business metrics:

<img
  title="Intelligent Workload summary with KPIs"
  alt="Screenshot showing Intelligent Workload summary page with KPIs, metrics, and AI insights banner"
  src="/images/intelligent-workload-summary-kpis.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**Workload KPIs:**</DNT> Custom business metrics displayed with current values and trend indicators.
</figcaption>

Each KPI tile displays:
* **KPI name and description**: Context about what the metric represents
* **Current value**: Real-time measurement of the metric
* **Time series chart**: Visual trend showing performance over the selected time range
* **Actions menu** (...): Options to edit, hide, or create alerts for this KPI

**What you can do**:
* **View all KPIs**: Click <DNT>**View all KPIs**</DNT> in the top right to navigate to the dedicated [KPIs page](#kpis-page) with detailed charts
* **Add KPIs**: Click <DNT>**+ Add new KPI**</DNT> to create additional metrics
* **Manage KPIs**: Access the full KPI management interface from Settings > Manage KPI


**Note**: You can display up to 3 KPIs on the summary page at once. Default KPIs include P99 Response Time and Success Rate for your focal transaction.

[Learn more about managing KPIs →](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis)

### 3. Workload metrics (Health status) [#health-status]

Below the KPI tiles, you'll find the Workload metrics section showing overall health status. For more on configuring health status, see [Workload status configuration](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration).

### 4. Golden metrics (Scoped to focal transaction) [#golden-metrics]

Three side-by-side charts showing key performance indicators scoped specifically to your focal transaction:

#### Response Time
* Displays latency trends for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Response time documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-response-time).


#### Throughput
* Displays request volume for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Throughput documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-throughput).

#### Errors
* Displays error count for your focal transaction over the selected time range. For more details, see [Errors documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/understand-errors).


**Why these matter**: These charts are automatically scoped to your focal transaction, giving you immediate visibility into the health of your specific business workflow without needing to filter through all entity data.

### 5. Participating entities [#participating-entities-section]

The bottom section shows performance metrics for all entities participating in your transaction:

<img
  title="Participating entities and Dynamic Flow Map"
  alt="Screenshot showing participating entities charts and Dynamic Flow Map visualization"
  src="/images/intelligent-workload-entities-flow-map.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**Participating entities:**</DNT> View performance metrics for all entities in your transaction flow.
</figcaption>

Three charts showing entity-level metrics:

#### Response Time (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Latency for up to 20 services handling your transaction
* **Multiple lines**: Each colored line represents a different service
* **Use case**: Identify which services are slowest and contributing to overall latency

#### Throughput (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Request volume handled by each service
* **Use case**: See which services handle the most requests in your transaction flow

#### Error Rate (Top 20 services scoped to transaction)
* **What it shows**: Error rates for each participating service
* **Use case**: Pinpoint which services are generating errors

**Why this matters**: While golden metrics show the focal transaction's performance, participating entities charts reveal which specific services in your distributed system are causing issues. This helps you quickly drill down to the root cause during troubleshooting.

#### Understanding gaps in service maps [#flowmap-gaps]

You may notice gaps or disconnected services in your service dependency visualizations. Here's what causes them and what you can do:

**Common causes of gaps:**

* **Low sampling rate**: If trace sampling is too low for certain service connections, New Relic may not have enough trace data during your selected time window to display those relationships.
  * **What you can do**: Some APM agents now include enhanced sampling options. Check your agent's latest version and sampling configuration. Additional sampling improvements are planned for future releases.

* **Missing telemetry**: A service in your transaction flow may be participating correctly but failing to send span data to New Relic.
  * **What you can do**:
    * Verify the service is properly instrumented and configured to send data to New Relic
    * Check network connectivity and firewall rules
    * Review agent logs for errors
  * **When you can't fix it**: Some service types (like certain AWS services) may not support span instrumentation. These gaps are expected and don't affect monitoring of services that do send data.

**Disconnected services:**

When a service in the middle of your trace fails to send data, you may see downstream services appear in your workload but disconnected from your focal entity. These disconnected services:
* Show up because they successfully send trace data
* Appear isolated because their parent service is missing from the trace
* May have their own connected child services

Recent improvements filter out most disconnected service fragments, significantly reducing false positives—especially in large, complex environments where many unrelated services exist.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you see persistent gaps or disconnected services, start by checking the sampling configuration and instrumentation health of the missing services. Focus on services that appear between your focal entity and the disconnected fragments.
</Callout>


### Errors [#errors]

The Errors page provides a centralized view of all errors occurring across your workload. For more on New Relic error tracking, see [Errors inbox documentation](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox).

When your workload health degrades, check the Errors page first to see if error rates spiked and which services are affected.


## Monitor section [#monitor]

The Monitor section provides different lenses to view your workload data.

### Transaction360 [#transaction360]

Transaction360 visualizes the complete distributed trace for your focal transaction. For more on Transaction360, see [Transaction360 documentation](/docs/apm/apm-ui-data/transaction360).

When troubleshooting slow transactions or errors, use Transaction360 to see exactly which service calls are slow or failing.

### KPIs page [#kpis-page]
