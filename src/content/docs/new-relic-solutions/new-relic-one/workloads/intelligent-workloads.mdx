<Callout variant="important">
  Intelligent workloads are in **Public Preview** and available to select customers.
</Callout>

Intelligent workloads automatically discover and track entities based on transaction flows from Transaction 360. They use distributed tracing to continuously update membership as your system evolves, eliminating manual maintenance and providing AI-powered insights into workload health.

## What makes Intelligent workloads different [#what-different]

Unlike [Standard workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads), which require manual configuration, Intelligent workloads automatically discover and track entities based on transaction flows, updating membership every 5 minutes. For a detailed comparison, see [Standard vs. Intelligent workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#comparison).

## Key features [#features]

### Automatic entity discovery [#auto-discovery]

Intelligent workloads analyze distributed traces from your selected transaction to identify all participating entities (applications, services, databases, infrastructure). As your architecture evolves, the workload automatically updates entity membership every 5 minutes.

### AI-powered insights (Preview) [#ai-insights]

Generate on-demand AI-powered summaries analyzing workload health, performance patterns, anomalies, and recommendations. AI insights help you quickly understand complex workload behavior without manually analyzing dozens of charts.

### Custom KPIs (Preview) [#custom-kpis]

Define workload-level metrics that connect technical performance to business outcomes (revenue, conversions, user actions, aggregated performance). Custom KPIs automatically scope to current workload entities and update as membership changes.

## How they differ from Standard workloads [#differences]

For a complete comparison of features and capabilities, see the [workload types comparison table](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#comparison) in the Workloads overview.

## Requirements [#requirements]

To use Intelligent workloads, you need:

* **Transaction 360**: Must be enabled with distributed tracing in your New Relic account
* **Trace data**: Recent distributed traces for the transactions you want to monitor
* **Permissions**: Ability to create and manage workloads in your account

### AI insights additional requirements [#ai-insights-requirements]

AI insights have specific infrastructure limitations:

* **AWS infrastructure only**: Not available on Azure environments
* **Not available to FedRAMP customers**: Due to AI processing requirements

## Limitations [#limitations]

<Callout variant="important">
  During Public Preview:
</Callout>

* **Update frequency**: 5 minutes (not configurable)
* **AI insights**: AWS infrastructure only
* **Entity types**: Limited to those captured in distributed traces

## When to use Intelligent workloads [#when-to-use]

Intelligent workloads are ideal for critical business transactions with dynamic architectures, complex dependencies, and scenarios where you need to connect technical metrics to business outcomes. For detailed decision criteria and use cases, see [Choosing the right workload type](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-overview#choose).

## Get started [#get-started]

Ready to create your first Intelligent workload?

1. **Enable distributed tracing**: [Set up distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for your services
2. **Find your transaction**: Use Transaction 360 to identify the transaction you want to monitor
3. **Create the workload**: [Create an Intelligent workload from Transaction 360](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-intelligent-workload)
4. **Configure monitoring**: Set up [custom KPIs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis) and [health status](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration)
5. **Generate insights**: Try [AI insights](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-ai-insights) to understand workload behavior
