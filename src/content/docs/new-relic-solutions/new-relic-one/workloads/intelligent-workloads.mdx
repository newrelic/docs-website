<Callout variant="important">
  Intelligent workloads are in **Public Preview** and available to select customers.
</Callout>

Intelligent workloads automatically discover and track entities based on transaction flows from Transaction 360. They use distributed tracing to continuously update membership as your system evolves, eliminating manual maintenance and providing AI-powered insights into workload health.

## What makes Intelligent workloads different [#what-different]

Unlike [Standard workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-workloads), which require manual configuration, Intelligent workloads:

* **Auto-discover entities**: Automatically include all services, databases, and infrastructure in a transaction flow
* **Stay up-to-date**: Refresh entity membership every 5 minutes based on distributed traces
* **Provide AI insights**: Generate AI-powered summaries of workload health and performance
* **Support custom KPIs**: Define business-specific metrics at the workload level
* **Adapt to change**: Automatically adjust as you deploy new services or modify architectures

## Key features [#features]

### Automatic entity discovery [#auto-discovery]

Intelligent workloads analyze distributed traces from your selected transaction to identify all participating entities:

* Frontend applications and APIs
* Backend services and microservices
* Databases and caching layers
* Message queues and event streams
* Supporting infrastructure

As your architecture evolves, the workload automatically adds new entities and removes ones no longer part of the transaction flow.

### AI-powered insights (Preview) [#ai-insights]

Generate on-demand summaries that analyze:

* Overall workload health and status trends
* Performance patterns and anomalies
* Entity-specific highlights and concerns
* Recommendations for investigation

AI insights help you quickly understand complex workload behavior without manually analyzing dozens of charts. Learn more about [AI insights for Intelligent workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-ai-insights).

### Custom KPIs (Preview) [#custom-kpis]

Define workload-level metrics that connect technical performance to business outcomes:

* Track business metrics (revenue, conversions, user actions)
* Monitor aggregated performance across all entities
* Measure end-to-end transaction metrics
* Alert on workload-level thresholds

Custom KPIs automatically scope to current workload entities and update as membership changes. Learn more about [managing KPIs for Intelligent workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis).

## Requirements [#requirements]

To use Intelligent workloads, you need:

* **Transaction 360 enabled**: Transaction 360 must be enabled in your New Relic account
* **Distributed tracing**: Enabled for all services in the transaction flow
* **Transaction 360 access**: Available in your New Relic account
* **Sufficient trace data**: Recent traces for the transactions you want to monitor
* **Workload permissions**: Ability to create and manage workloads in your account

### AI insights additional requirements [#ai-insights-requirements]

AI insights have specific infrastructure limitations:

* **AWS infrastructure only**: Not available on Azure environments
* **Not available to FedRAMP customers**: Due to AI processing requirements

## Limitations [#limitations]

<Callout variant="important">
  During Public Preview:
</Callout>

* **Update frequency**: 5 minutes (not configurable)
* **AI insights**: AWS infrastructure only
* **Entity types**: Limited to those captured in distributed traces

## When to use Intelligent workloads [#when-to-use]

Intelligent workloads are ideal for:

### Critical business transactions

### Business-critical monitoring
When you need to connect technical metrics to business outcomes:
* SLA compliance tracking
* Revenue-impacting transactions
* Customer-facing workflows
* Regulatory compliance monitoring

## Get started [#get-started]

Ready to create your first Intelligent workload?

1. **Enable distributed tracing**: [Set up distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for your services
2. **Find your transaction**: Use Transaction 360 to identify the transaction you want to monitor
3. **Create the workload**: [Create an Intelligent workload from Transaction 360](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/create-intelligent-workload)
4. **Configure monitoring**: Set up [custom KPIs](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/intelligent-workload-kpis) and [health status](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-configuration)
