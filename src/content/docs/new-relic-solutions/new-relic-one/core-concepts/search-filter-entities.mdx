The entity filter bar helps you quickly find and filter the monitored [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) you want to examine across New Relic's interface.

## Locate the filter bar [#find]

The entity filter bar is prominently displayed at the top of key New Relic pages including:
- <DNT>**[Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs/)**</DNT> page for <DNT>**Applications**</DNT>, <DNT>**Repositories**</DNT>, and <DNT>**Infrastructure**</DNT>.
- All Entities.
- APM service pages.
- <InlinePopover type="browser"/> pages.
- Infrastructure monitoring pages and many more.

## Using the filter bar [#usage]

The current entity filter bar provides several filtering options:

### Search by entity name
Use the <DNT>**Search by entity name**</DNT> field to quickly find entities: Type in a string of characters (for example, an environment) to find any entity that contains this string in its name. All matched results display in the UI.

### Filter dropdowns
Apply specific filters using the dropdown menus:
* <DNT>**Entity Type**</DNT>: The Entity Type dropdown displays entity types that are associated with your current search query, allowing you to select specific types like applications, services, or hosts to further narrow your results.
{/* * <DNT>**AI Tool**</DNT>: The AI Tool filter shows available AI tools and integrations used by the filtered entities. */}
* <DNT>**Team**</DNT>: The Team dropdown displays only teams that have ownership or assignment of entities in your current filtered set, making it easy to focus on entities managed by specific teams within your organization. In order to enable this Team filter you need to enable [Service Architecture Intelligence](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started/) first.
* Additional filter options may appear based on your account configuration and the page in which you are in. To do this,
  1. Click **+**.
  2. From the Filter dropdown, select an attribute.
  3. Select an operator: =, !=, LIKE, or NOT LIKE.
  4. Select a value to complete the filter.
  5. Click **Add**.

For advanced querying and analysis, consider using [the NRQL query builder](https://one.newrelic.com/data-exploration/query-builder). For more information on NRQL queries, refer [How to use NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works).
