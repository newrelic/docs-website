The entity filter bar helps you find and filter the monitored [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) you want to examine across New Relic's interface.

## Locate the filter bar [#find]

The entity filter bar is displayed at the top of key New Relic pages including:
- <DNT>**[Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs/)**</DNT> page for <DNT>**Applications**</DNT>, <DNT>**Repositories**</DNT>, and <DNT>**Infrastructure**</DNT>.
- <DNT>**All Entities**</DNT> page.
- APM service pages.
- <InlinePopover type="browser"/> pages.
- Infrastructure monitoring pages and many more.

## Basic search and filtering [#basic-filtering]

Start with these fundamental filtering methods to quickly locate entities:

### Search by entity name
Use the <DNT>**Search by entity name**</DNT> field to quickly find entities:
1. Click in the search field.
2. Type part of an entity name (for example, "production" or "web-app").
3. View matching results that appear instantly in the list below.

**Tip:** The search matches any part of the entity name, so typing "prod" will find entities with names like "prod-web-server" and "my-production-app".

### Filter by entity type
Narrow your results by selecting specific entity types:
* <DNT>**Entity Type**</DNT>: Choose from applications, services, hosts, containers, and other monitored resource types.
* **Result:** Only entities matching your selected type will display, making it easier to focus on specific infrastructure components.

### Filter by team ownership
Focus on entities managed by your team:
* <DNT>**Team**</DNT>: Select teams that have ownership of entities in your current view.
* **Requirement:** You need to enable [Service Architecture Intelligence](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started/).
* **Result:** View only entities assigned to or owned by the selected team.

## Advanced filtering [#advanced-filtering]

For more complex filtering scenarios, create custom filters:

### Create custom attribute filters
Add specific filters based on entity attributes:
1. Click **+** next to the existing filters.
2. From the <DNT>**Filter**</DNT> dropdown, select an attribute (such as environment, region, or custom tags).
3. Choose an operator:
   - **=** (equals): Exact match
   - **!=** (not equals): Exclude exact matches
   - **LIKE**: Contains the specified text
   - **NOT LIKE**: Excludes the specified text
4. Enter or select a value to complete the filter.
5. Click <DNT>**Add**</DNT> to apply the filter.

**Example:** To find all production web applications, you might filter where `environment = production` AND `entity_type = APPLICATION`.
