Most of the time, the `nr1` CLI commands will just work, requiring no extra configuration. You'll be able to create Nerdpacks, Nerdlets, launchers, and visualizations without a hitch. But sometimes, you need something special for your setup.

In this guide, you'll learn how you can enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the latest version of the `nr1` CLI:

```sh
nr1 update
```

## Extend your webpack configuration

You can use our `.extended-webpackrc.js` file to extend your webpack for configuration. This allows you to add your own aliases, scripts, and configurations when locally serving or deploying your app.

## Add extra certificates

When working with `nr1` behind a corporate proxy, you may see a `RequestError`:

```sh
nr1 create --type nerdpack --name new-nerdpack
[output] {error}RequestError: Error:{normal} self signed certificate in certificate chain
```

Node uses its own certificate chain. So, if you're getting this error, you need to add your corporate certificate to Node's "root" CAs:

```sh
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=[cert]
```
