New Relic gives you many options for [bringing in data from any source](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/intro-custom-data) and creating custom [charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) and [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards). But if you want to go beyond those options, and create your own experiences in New Relic, we give you access to the same tools we use to build apps on our platform. 

New Relic applications are React JavaScript applications that:

* Reside on the [New Relic platform](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), alongside your other <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and data.
* Feature visualizations that you've tailored specifically for your organization.
* Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from another service or API.

Keep reading to learn more about what you can do with New Relic apps. Or, if you want to skip ahead and start building your own apps, first read the [requirements on our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/permission-manage-apps).

## New Relic: a programmable platform [#what-is-it]

We strive to have an automated user experience that provides optimal value for all users. But we also know that some organizations have unique business needs that can't be met with our standard chart and dashboard visualization options.

Now, we give you control over the fundamental building blocks of our platform. Using the same tools our engineers use to build the New Relic platform, you can build custom applications that align with your unique organizational structure and business needs. If you know how to use React, GraphQL, and NRQL (our query language), building an application will take you only a few minutes.

Check out the [guides on our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps) for help building custom applications. Or, for a quick overview of how to get started with building your own app, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:15 minutes).

## Get started [#get-started]

With New Relic, you can solve any data-driven challenge, no matter how complex. For example:

* Use our APIs to [get data into New Relic from any source](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/intro-custom-data).
* [Visualize that data in your custom applications](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps).

  If your visualization needs are relatively simple, consider using [custom charts](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) and [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards).
