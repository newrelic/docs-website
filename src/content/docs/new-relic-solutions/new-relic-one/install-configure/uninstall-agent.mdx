Some [New Relic solutions](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/) require installation of an agent. You can uninstall the agent if you want it to stop reporting data. If you need to uninstall New Relic completely, follow the procedures for your agent.

If you encounter problems, see [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Before you uninstall [#downgrade]

<Callout variant="important">
  For paying New Relic organizations, an alternative to uninstalling is to [downgrade](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account) to a lower edition.
</Callout>

## Uninstall APM [#language-agents]

After uninstalling <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents or making a change to your startup script, you must restart your app (or the app server or web server where it is located). You must do this because New Relic agents typically run in the memory of the process running the app. Simply removing those files will **not** stop the applications that are currently running from sending data to New Relic.
