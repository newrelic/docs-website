<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The new map experience provides a unified and integrated view of your cloud estate, allowing seamless navigation and exploration of services and infrastructure. It integrates tracing, infrastructure, and performance data into a cohesive experience, addressing limitations of service map.

## Add-on features for new map [#add-on-features]

The new map works with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and the Auto-discovery features to connect relationships between entities. While the new map remains functional even if you haven't enabled distributed tracing or auto-discovery, enabling these features is recommended for a more impactful and consistent experience.

* **Distributed tracing**: Provides seamless visibility into service interactions by enabling tracing for all agents, ensuring comprehensive insights.
* **Auto-discovery**: Visualizes relationships between AWS services, allowing you to see relationships within your cloud infrastructure. Without auto-discovery, you see only the relationships between AWS services and other New Relic services, not between AWS services themselves.

By leveraging both distributed tracing and auto-discovery, you can maximize the insights and utility of the Advanced service map, ensuring a more thorough understanding of your cloud estate.

## Map types [#map-types]

The New Map offers four distinct types of maps, each tailored to provide insights into different aspects of your cloud environment. These map types help you visualize service interactions, infrastructure dependencies, team-specific operations, and data flows.

### Service map [#service-map]

The Service map allows you to visualize relationships and dependencies between the services for Mobile, Browser, and APM. By accessing the Service map, you can gain insights into the performance and status of your services, enabling proactive monitoring and troubleshooting. In the service map, only services are visible in default view. You can enable to view the ifrastructure resources associated with the service in a dedicated layer.

To access the map for Mobile, Browser or APM services:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
2. From the capability list, select either <DNT>**APM & services**</DNT>, <DNT>**Mobile**</DNT>, or <DNT>**Browser**</DNT>.
3. From the service list, search and select the service you want to view.
4. To open the map, from the second-left nav, click <DNT>**Maps**</DNT>.

If there are any alerts associated with the service, then you can access the map for that service directly from <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Alerts](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts)**</DNT>.
2. To open the issue page, from the <DNT>**Issues & Actitvity**</DNT> page, select the issue that is associated with a service (Check the <DNT>**Entity name**</DNT> column).
3. To get the service map, from the issue page, scroll to the <DNT>**Impacted entries**</DNT> section.

### Infrastructure map [#infrastructure-map]

The Infrastructure Map is designed to explore infrastructure resources and relationships for Hosts. It offers a detailed view of how infrastructure components support your services, allowing you to inspect AWS and cloud resources directly. This map type helps you understand the underlying infrastructure dependencies that are critical for maintaining service performance and availability. If you have enrolled for the Auto-discovery feature, you can view the internal relationships between AWS services.

To access the Infrastructure map:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts) > All entities**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**All entities**</DNT> page, select the host you want to view.
3. To open the map, on the host page, click <DNT>**Infrastructure**</DNT>.

### Teams map [#teams-map]

The Teams Map provides a view of team-specific services and their interactions. It allows you to explore services and dependencies within the context of your team's operations, facilitating collaboration and efficient management of team-owned resources. By using the Teams map, you can ensure that your team's services are aligned with organizational goals and are operating optimally.

To access the Teams map:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Teams](https://one.newrelic.com/teams)**</DNT>.
2. To get the details of a team, from the <DNT>**Teams**</DNT> page, select a team.
3. To open the map, go to the <DNT>**Map**</DNT> tab.

### Dynamic flow map [#dynamic-flow-map]

The Dynamic Flow Map offers a detailed view of data flow through your services, including interactions with databases and other backend components. It provides insights into performance and potential bottlenecks, allowing for effective troubleshooting. By visualizing the flow of data across your services and resources, the Dynamic flow map helps you optimize application performance and ensure efficient data processing.

To access the Dynamic flow map:

1. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>, open any Service, Infrastructure, or Team map.
2. To open the dynamic flow map, point to a node and click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT>.
