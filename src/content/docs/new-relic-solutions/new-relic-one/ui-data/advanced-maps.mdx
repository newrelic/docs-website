<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The **Advanced service map** offers a unified and integrated visualization of your cloud estate, enabling seamless navigation and exploration. It integrates tracing, infrastructure, and performance data into a cohesive experience, allowing users to understand and act on dependencies, performance issues, and connections within their ecosystem.

<Callout variant="important">While the traditional service map experience is available to **Free**, **Standard**, **Pro**, **Enterprise**, and **Core Compute** customers, the advanced service map experince is available only to **Advanced Compute** customers. To learn more, refer to **[Advanced Compute](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing)**.</Callout>

To enroll in <DNT>**Advanced service map**</DNT>, refer to the **Trial & Preview** section. After enrolling, the advance service map experience replaces the tradional map. If you want to roll back to the traditional service map, perform the following steps:



## Use advanced service map [#using-advanced-maps]

Advanced service map works with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and the Auto-discovery features to connect relationships between entities. While the Advanced service map remains functional even if you haven't enabled distributed tracing or auto-discovery, enabling these features is recommended for a more impactful and consistent experience.

* **Distributed tracing**: Provides seamless visibility into service interactions by enabling tracing for all agents, ensuring comprehensive insights.
* **Auto-discovery**: Visualizes relationships between AWS services, allowing you to see relationships within your cloud infrastructure. Without auto-discovery, you see only the relationships between AWS services and other New Relic services, not between AWS services themselves.

By leveraging both distributed tracing and auto-discovery, you can maximize the insights and utility of the Advanced service map, ensuring a more thorough understanding of your cloud estate.

To access service map:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
2. Select either <DNT>**APM & services**</DNT>, <DNT>**Mobile**</DNT>, or <DNT>**Browser**</DNT>.
2. Select an entity.
3. On the left-hand side, click <DNT>**Service map**</DNT>.

### Map from a specific entity [#advanced-map-specific-entity]

Hover your cursor over an entity and click <DNT>**Map from this entity**</DNT> to view how entities are related from that entity's perspective. The service map will update accordingly.

### Check service health summary [#health-status]

### Group services for better visualization [#group-services]

### Use cluster view [#cluster-view]

### Customize your map [#customize-map]
* config panel
* show/hide servives
* hop view

### Check service relationships and dependencies [#service-relationships]

### Dynamic flow map [#dynamic-flow-map]


### Access the service owner
* Teams map


















### Filter entities [#filter-map]

  alt="A GIF of how service map updates when filtering the health status, timewarp, entity type, and relationship depth."
  src="/images/solutions_screenshot-full_filter-service-map.gif"
/>

You can filter the service map based:

* <DNT>**Health status**</DNT>: Remove the health status color around affected entities.
* <DNT>**Entity types**</DNT>: Hide specific entities from the map.
* <DNT>**Timewarp**</DNT>: Explore how entity health changed in the last three hours.
* <DNT>**Relationship depth**</DNT>:

  * <DNT>**Depth 1**</DNT>: (Default) Displays all entities directly connected to the main entity, regardless of their health status.
  * <DNT>**Depth 2**</DNT>: Focuses on degraded entities (with alerts) that are two hops away from the main entity. Entities with direct connections to the main entity are not included in this view.
  * <DNT>**Depth 3**</DNT>: Similar to depth 2, depth 3 concentrates on degraded entities with alerts but extends the search to entities that are three hops away from the main entity. Direct connections to the main entity remain excluded.

  <Callout variant="tip">
    The purpose of limiting the display of entities to degraded ones in depths 2 and 3 is to prevent the service map from becoming cluttered and overwhelming. As you increase the relationship depth, you are going further into the network of entities, but you are only seeing entities that are experiencing issues. This can help you to focus on the most critical problems in your system.

### View entity performance metrics [#performance-data]

The right-hand pane contains in-depth data about all entity performance.

Taken together, maps help you find the exact moment and place an incident appeared in your system.

## Explore service relationships with GraphQL APIs [#api]

You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with in our NerdGraph explorer, a tool to run GraphQL queries and mutations. To get started, see [NerdGraph tutorial: View entity data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/).

## Troubleshoot [#troubleshoot]

If you are unable to view certain entities in service maps, see [Missing or obfuscated data](/docs/troubleshooting-missing-or-obfuscated-data-new-relic-one).

If you have uninstrumented entites, see [Uninstrumented entities in service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/uninstrumented-entities-service-maps).

## About externals and databases in maps [#externals]

In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types:

* Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, <DNT>**externals**</DNT> are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported.
* Due to their agentless nature, databases cannot have alerts set for them; only service calls made to the database are reported to New Relic.
