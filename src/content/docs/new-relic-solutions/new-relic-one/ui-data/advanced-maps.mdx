## Map entry points [#entry-points]

The New map provides a consistent mapping experience accessible through various entry points. Depending on the type of entity you select to explore, separate views are available to show services, teams, infrastructure resources, or dynamic data flows. This unified approach offers clear insights into service interactions, infrastructure dependencies, team operations, and data flows.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="service-map"
      title="Visualize service interactions"
      >
      The map enables you to visualize relationships and dependencies among services within mobile, browser, and APM environments. In its default view, the map displays only the services, but you can choose to view associated infrastructure resources in a dedicated layer.

      To access the map for mobile, browser, and APM environments:

      1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
      2. From the capability list, select either <DNT>**APM & services**</DNT>, <DNT>**Mobile**</DNT>, or <DNT>**Browser**</DNT>.

      id="infrastructure-map"
      title="Visualize infrastructure resources"
      >
      Through the map you can explore infrastructure resources and their internal relationships. It provides a detailed view of how infrastructure components support your services, enabling you to directly inspect AWS and cloud resources. The map helps you understand the underlying infrastructure dependencies that are critical for maintaining service performance and availability. With [AWS Auto-discovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities), you can also view the internal relationships between AWS services.

      To access the Infrastructure map:

      1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts) > All entities**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="important">
  The new map works with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and the [Auto-discovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities) features to connect relationships between entities. While the new map experience remains functional even if you haven't enabled distributed tracing or auto-discovery, enabling these features is recommended for a more impactful and consistent experience.
</Callout>


## Use the new map experience [#use-new-map]

With the features and components of the new map, you can explore and manage your cloud environment in the following ways:

  <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="health-status"
      title="Manage node visibility using health status"
      >
      The Health status summary provides a quick overview of all nodes. Each health status is represented by a color legend, with a number next to each legend indicating the count of nodes in that status. This allows you to quickly assess and address areas needing attention.
         <img
          title="color-code"
          alt="color-code"
          src="/images/color-code.webp"
          /> 

        ### Instrument the uninstrumented nodes [#node-instrumentation] 

          If there are any uninstrumented nodes in the map, they appear with a dotted border. After you instrument the nodes, the map refreshes to show the updated health status.

          To instrument nodes:
          1. From the health status summary of the map, point to <DNT>**Uninstrumented**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Instrument what's missing**</DNT>.
          2. On the <DNT>**Add more instrumentation**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions to instrument each entity.
            
  
        ### Filter nodes by health status [#node-filtering]

          If you want to focus on some nodes with specific health categories, filter the nodes as follows. 
          1. To open the <DNT>**Map View Settings**</DNT> panel, from the top-right of the map, click **Settings**.
          2. From the <DNT>**Health Status**</DNT> list, select the specific status you want to view. The map view updates to show only the nodes with the selected health status.

        ### Manage clusters with health status [#cluster-health-status]

          If clusters are available in your map view, you can filter nodes in it by health status and display them separately. Point to a cluster and reveal the health status to show nodes with that status outside the cluster. This helps you focus on specific nodes within the cluster.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="group-services"
      title="Group nodes to organize the map view"
      >
      You can group nodes in the map to reduce clutter and highlight relationships, making it easier to identify patterns and manage dependencies. This structured approach provides a clear and organized view of your cloud environment, tailored to your specific needs.

      ### Create groups [#create-groups]

      1. To organize nodes by a specific attribute in the map, go to the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down and select the attribute.
      2. To get the grouping on the map, click <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. Each group displays the number of nodes it contains.
      3. To add another level to the group, from the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down, click <DNT>**+ Create a group**</DNT> > select an attribute > <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. The first level attribute forms the primary group, and the second level attribute forms sub-groups nested in the primary group. You can apply up to five levels of grouping.

      #### Group appearance and naming [#group-appearance]

      Groups are named based on the selected attribute. For example, if you are grouping the nodes by the `Account` attribute, the group name appears as `Account: <account name>`. Groups are color-coded according to the health status of the nodes within them, as follows:
      * **Red**: At least one critical node
      * **Yellow**: At least one degraded node but no critical nodes
      * **Green**: All nodes are operational

      You can expand groups to view the nodes and nested sub-groups within them. As per your requirement you can reorder group levels by shuffling attributes in the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down.


    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="map-navigation"
      title="Navigate on the map to explore node details, relationships, and dependencies"
      >
      The map provides several features to help you explore relationships, dependencies, and metric and team details of an entity. When you point to a node on the map, a pop-over appears with the following interaction options, and three golden metrics. You can use these options to navigate and explore the map further.
      
      
      ### Expand dependency [#expand-dependency]

      To view the dependent nodes of any node on the map, point to the node and click <DNT>**Expand dependencies**</DNT>. That node becomes the focal node, revealing all one depth away dependent nodes with connected edges.

      ### Inspect infrastructure resources [#inspect-resources]

      To view the infrastructure resources associated with a node, point to the node and click <DNT>**Inspect Infrastructure**</DNT>. The infrastructure map opens, displaying the associated infrastructure nodes and their internal relationship two depths away from the APM service. If you have enabled for the [Auto-discovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities) feature, you can view the internal relationships between AWS services.

      ### View dynamic flow [#view-data-flow]

      To view the data flow through your node, including interactions with databases and other backend components, point to a node and click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT>. The dynamic flow map opens, providing a detailed view of data flow through the node, including interactions with databases and other backend components.

      ### Access node owner [#access-node-owner]

      To access the owner of a node, point to the node and click the team name. The team page opens, displaying the team details and the entities owned by the team.

      ### Access the node details [#access-node-details]

      To view and adjust details of a node, point to the node and click the node name. The entity summary page opens, displaying the entity details.




    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="bypass-gateways"
      title="Bypass gateways to reveal actual nodes"
      >
      In the new map experience, gateways can mask the true entities that your focal node connects with. To visualize the actual node instead of the gateway, you can manually establish a bypass call relationship.

      To set up a bypass call relationship:
      1. On the map, select the gateway node that you want to bypass. The name of the gateways may start with, `Gateway:`, `Nerdgraph:`, or `GraphQL:`.
      2. On the right panel, under the <DNT>**Tags**</DNT> section, add the `service_gateway: true` tag.
      3. To apply the changes, refesh the map. The actual node replaces the gateway node, allowing you to view the bypass call relationship between the focal node and the actual node.
    </Collapser>
  </CollapserGroup>
