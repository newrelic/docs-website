## Add-on features for new map [#add-on-features]

The new map works with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and the Auto-discovery features to connect relationships between entities. While the new map remains functional even if you haven't enabled distributed tracing or auto-discovery, enabling these features is recommended for a more impactful and consistent experience.

* **Distributed tracing**: Provides seamless visibility into service interactions by enabling tracing for all agents, ensuring comprehensive insights.
* **Auto-discovery**: Visualizes relationships between AWS services, allowing you to see relationships within your cloud infrastructure. Without auto-discovery, you see only the relationships between AWS services and other New Relic services, not between AWS services themselves.

By leveraging both distributed tracing and auto-discovery, you can maximize the insights and utility of the Advanced service map, ensuring a more thorough understanding of your cloud estate.

## Use the new map [#use-new-map]

With the new map's features and components, you can explore and manage your cloud environment in the following ways:

  <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="health-status"
      title="Manage node visibility using health status"
      >
      The Health status summary provides a quick overview of all nodes. Each health status is represented by a color legend, with a number next to each legend indicating the count of nodes in that status. This allows you to quickly assess and address areas needing attention.
         <img
          title="color-code"
          alt="color-code"
          src="/images/color-code.webp"
          /> 

        ### Instrument the uninstrumented nodes [#node-instrumentation] 

          If there are any uninstrumented nodes in the map, they appear with a dotted border. You can instrument those nodes as follows. After you have instrumented the entities, the map refreshes to show the updated health status.
          1. From the Health status summary of the map, point to <DNT>**Uninstrumented**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Instrument what's missing**</DNT>.
          2. On the <DNT>**Add more instrumentation**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions to instrument each entity.
            
  
        ### Filter nodes by health status [#node-filtering]

          If you want to focus on some nodes with specific health categories, filter the nodes as follows. 
          1. To open the <DNT>**Map View Settings**</DNT> panel, from the top-right of the map, click the **Settings** icon.
          2. From the <DNT>**Health Status**</DNT> list, select the specific status you want to view. The map view updates to show only the nodes with the selected health status.

        ### Manage clusters with health status [#cluster-health-status]

          If clusters are simplifying your map view, you can filter nodes by health status to display them separately. Point to a cluster and reveal the health status to show nodes with that status on the map outside the cluster. This helps you focus on specific nodes within the cluster.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="group-services"
      title="Group nodes to organize the map view"
      >
      You can group nodes in the map to reduce clutter and highlight relationships, making it easier to identify patterns and manage dependencies. This structured approach provides a clear and organized view of your cloud environment, tailored to your specific needs.

      ### Create groups [#create-groups]

      1. To organize nodes by a specific attribute in the map, go to the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down and select the attribute.
      2. To get the grouping on the map, click <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. Each group displays the number of nodes it contains, and the focal node is included in its respective group.
      3. To add another level to the group, from the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down, click <DNT>**+ Create a group**</DNT> > select an attribute > <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. The first level attribute forms the primary group, and the second level attribute forms sub-groups nested in the primary group. You can apply up to five levels of grouping.

      #### Group appearance and naming [#group-appearance]

      Groups are named based on the selected attribute. For example, if you are grouping the nodes by the `Account` attribute, the group name appears as `Account: <account name>`. Groups are color-coded according to the health status of the nodes within them, as follows:
      * **Red**: At least one critical node
      * **Yellow**: At least one degraded node but no critical nodes
      * **Green**: All nodes are operational.

      You can expand groups to view the nodes and nested sub-groups within them. As per your requirement you can reorder group levels by shuffling attributes in the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down.


    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="map-navigation"
      title="Navigate on the map to explore node details, relationships, and dependencies"
      >
      The map provides several features to help you explore relationships, dependencies, and metric and team details of an entity, ensuring you can efficiently manage and understand your cloud environment. When you point to a node on the map, a pop-over appears with the following interaction options, and three golden metrics. You can use these options to navigate and explore the map further.
      
      
      ### Expand dependency [#expand-dependency]

      To view the dependent nodes of any node on the map, point to the node and click the <DNT>**Expand Dependency**</DNT> button. The node becomes the focal point, revealing all one-depth-away dependent nodes with connected edges. To return to the original map with the initial focal node, hover over the focal point and click the button again.

      ### Inspect infrastructure resources [#inspect-resources]

      To view the infrastructure resources associated with a node, point to the node and click the <DNT>**View infrastructure**</DNT> button. The infrastructure map opens, displaying the associated infrastructure nodes and their internal relationship. If you have enrolled for the Auto-discovery feature, you can view the internal relationships between AWS services.

      ### View data flow [#view-data-flow]

      To view the data flow through your node, including interactions with databases and other backend components, point to a node and click the <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT> button. The dynamic flow map opens, providing a detailed view of data flow through the node, including interactions with databases and other backend components.

      ### Access node owner [#access-node-owner]

      To access the owner of a node, point to the node and click the team name. The team page opens, displaying the team details and the entities owned by the team.

      ### Access the node details [#access-node-details]

      To view and adjust details of a node, point to the node and click the node name. The entity summry page opens, displaying the entity details.




    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="bypass-gateways"
      title="Bypass gateways to reveal actual nodes"
      >
      In the map, gateways can mask the true entities that your focal node connects with. To visualize the actual node instead of the gateway, you can manually establish a bypass call relationship.

      To set up a bypass call relationship:
      1. On the map, select the gateway node that you want to bypass. The name of the gateways may start with, `Gateway:`, `Nerdgraph:`, or `GraphQL:`.
      2. On the right panel, under the <DNT>**Tags**</DNT> section add the `service_gateway: true` tag.
      3. To apply the changes, refesh the map. The actual node replaces the gateway node, allowing you to view the bypass call relationship between the focal node and the actual node.
    </Collapser>
