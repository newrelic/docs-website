The New Relic automap feature displays entity-centric maps that help you troubleshoot incidents that cascade through interconnected services. With automap, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the relationships around your affected entity.

To use automap, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

## How it works [#how-works]

Automap displays relationships between entities in your architecture based on direct calls between services. For example, <InlinePopover type="apm" /> services are represented as nodes on the map and direct calls are represented as arrows. The direction of the arrow shows you the direction of the call being made.

With automap, you get deeper insight into the upstream and downstream relationships surrounding your chosen entity. One feature of automap, for example, is the ability to adjust relationship depth so you can see just how far an incident has cascaded. In the following screenshot, you can see an automap view with the relationship depth set to **One**:

  src={solutionsOmnimapView}
/>

Compare how automap expands outward from the source entity an additional level when the depth is set to **Three**.

<img

  alt="A screenshot of automap from the New Relic UI. This map is set to three relationships out from the source entity."
  src={solutionsAutomapViewrel3}
/>

To understand entities and relationships, as well as how the entity platform synthesizes both from telemetry data, see [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) and [relationships](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial/). To learn more about how automap fits in with our other maps experiences, see [Maps in context](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/maps-in-context)

<Callout variant="important">
  Automap auto-expand logic relies on the health status of an entity, which is largely determined by the alert status of that entity. For optimal troubleshooting with automap, ensure that your [alerts are properly configured](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/alerts-applied-intelligence/alerts-best-practices/).

## Open automap [#open-automap]

You can access automap whenever you're in an omnimap-powered maps experience, such as [service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps) or [workloads maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads#maps). The simplest way to access automap is by using the entity tooltip:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then select either **APM & services**, **Mobile**, or **Browser**.
2. Choose your source entity.
3. Select **Service map** under the **Monitor** category.
3. Hover your cursor over the entity, then click **Map from this entity** in the tooltip. An automap pane will open.

Automap is available for the following types of entities:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Entity type

## Timewarp cursor: Go back in time [#timewarp-cursor]

You can use the timewarp feature to explore changes between your entities from the last three hours. Simply move the **Timewarp** cursor to see health status changes. 

<img
  title="Timewarp in automap view"
  alt="A screenshot of where to find the timewarp feature in the automap UI. You can find timewarp by going to the top pane and moving to the right."
  src={solutionsTimewarp}
/>

## Controls: See only what you need to see [#filter-automap]

De-emphasize certain entities on the map with **Health Status**, or hide entities entirely with **Entity types**. Keep in mind that toggling **Health status** will not remove nodes from your map. Instead, it'll remove the entity health outline around the nodes.

  <img
    title="Screenshot showing the top pane, where you can control what you see in automap"
    alt="A screenshot showing two dropdowns that let you control what you see in automap. The screenshot has Not alerting entities and Synthetic monitoring entities de-selected, which alters automap."
    src={solutionsAutomapControls}
  />

## Map symbols [#map-symbols]

Here's a table showing the various health status icons:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Health status
      </th>

      <th style="text-align:center">
        Icon
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

          alt="Screenshot showing the red critical hexagon"
