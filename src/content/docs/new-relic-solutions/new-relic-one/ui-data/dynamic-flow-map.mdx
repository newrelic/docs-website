<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy). 
</Callout>

<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> is a visualization tool that provides a map view of aggregated trace data. It highlights performance signals related to a specific service, called focal service. The map uses tracing data to display relationships between services participating in traces with the focal service, correlating performance changes across upstream and downstream entities. This helps identify performance bottlenecks in applications and services, aiding in pinpointing the root cause.

## Why it matters [#why-it-matters]

<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> helps in reducing the mean time to resolution by allowing you to visualize and identify performance anomalies. By correlating upstream and downstream tracing performance data, it helps you understand how different services interact and affect each other's performance.

To access the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, and get familiar with map components and features, refer [<DNT>**Maps**</DNT>](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/advanced-maps).

<Callout variant="important">
 [<DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) is required for the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> to work, and it is enabled by default for all APM agents. If data is not visible, ensure <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT> is active for the focal and associated entities, and verify that tracing data appears in New Relic.

## Explore the dynamic flow map [#explore-dynamic-flow-map]

To access the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>:

1. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>, open any [service, infrastructure, or team map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/advanced-maps).
2. To open the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, point to a node and click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT>.

You can also access the map from [<DNT>**Transactions 360**</DNT>](/docs/apm/transactions/workload-performance-monitoring/transaction-workloads/). As you can view the map of a particular transaction showing the services involved and the time taken by each service, it is called <DNT>**Trace Flow Map**</DNT>. <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> and <DNT>**Trace Flow Map**</DNT> are similar in features and functionality.


The <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> shows relationships between the focal entity and surrounding entities one depth away. Upstream services are represented with call path arrows pointing towards the focal entity, while downstream services have arrows pointing away from it. You can interact with the map to view performance trends, anomalies, and other details as follows:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="anamolies" title="Analyze anamolies">
 The anamolies are displayed with color-coded call paths and dots next to the service nodes, as follows:
 * **Blue call path**: Latency issues between the services.
 * **Red call path**: Error issues between the services.
 * **Blue and red striped call path**: Both latency and error issues between the services.
 * **Color-coded dots next to a service node**: Performance anomalies in the service.
 <Callout variant="tip">
        A service may show an anomaly without a corresponding color-coded call path. It indicates that the signals for this call path are correlated less strongly than others.
      </Callout>
</Collapser>
<Collapser id="performance-trends" title="View performance trends">
 On the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, to view the performance trends between the focal entity and a surrounding entities, click the surrounding one. The call path between the focal entity and the selected entity gets highlighted, and the performance trends appears in the right panel showing the metrics time series graphs.

 From the right panel, you can analyze the performance trends and manage the entities as follows:
 * Identify patterns between your selected entities.
 * Interact with the time series charts, by selecting the entities under the chart.
 * See all traces between the selected entities.
 * Assign ownership of entity to specific teams.
 * Add tags to the entity.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="investigate-issues" title="Investigate issues">
 On the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, after identifying a entity with correlated performance issues with the focal entity, you can investigate the traces between the entities. To view the traces, from the right panel, click **See all traces**. By analyzing the traces, you can identify the root cause of the performance issues and take necessary actions to resolve them.
