New Relic can detect gaps on your instrumentation by analyzing your telemetry.These gaps can be databases, apps, or basically any other type of entity. For example, one application could be storing information in a non-instrumented Amazon RDS database.

When that happens, you'll see in the form of an "uninstrumented" entity the created gaps. You can check it in the [service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps). You can also see the relationship between this uninstrumented entity and the instrumented one, which in this example is CALLS.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that you'll see the uninstrumented entities slightly different than the instrumented ones. Both are hexagons, but uninstrumented entities have a dotter border instead of a solid one.
</Callout>

Knowing what is not instrumented increases your visibility over your platform and gives you more control over it. To instrument a uninstrumented entity, you need to click on it, choose `instrument`, and you'll see a tutorial on how to perform the instrumentation depending on the type of entity. After this process is finished, the service map displays the entities as usual, using the solid border.
