New Relic can detect gaps on your instrumentation by analyzing your telemetry.These gaps can be databases, apps, or basically any other type of entity. For example, one application could be storing information in a non-instrumented Amazon RDS database.

When that happens, you'll see in the form of an "uninstrumented" entity the created gaps. You can check it in the [service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps). You can also see the relationship between this uninstrumented entity and the instrumented one, which in this example is CALLS.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that uninstrumented and instrumented entities have different appearances. Uninstrumented entities use a dotted border while instrumented entities use a solid one.
</Callout>

To instrument an uninstrumented entity, you need to click on it, choose `instrument`, and follow the guided tutorial on how to perform the instrumentation, which depends on the type of entity. After you finish this process, the service map displays the entities with a solid border.
