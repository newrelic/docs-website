For your monitored applications in our <InlinePopover type="apm" />, <InlinePopover type="browser" />, and mobile monitoring UI, the <DoNotTranslate>**Dependencies**</DoNotTranslate> UI page shows a filterable list of all the applications, services, databases, and hosts that New Relic identifies as a connection to that [entity](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic). It shows upstream and downstream dependencies, and provides paths to explore them.

While [service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one) displays an entity-scoped map of an entity's relationships, the <DoNotTranslate>**Dependencies**</DoNotTranslate> UI page displays your upstream and downstream services in a table. It also uses the same [color coding system used by service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one#alerts) to show you what's performing well and what isn't. 

## Requirements

The <DoNotTranslate>**Dependencies**</DoNotTranslate> UI page is available for entities monitored by our APM agents, our mobile agents, and our browser agents. 

## View dependencies [#access]

To view dependencies for applications, services, databases, and hosts connected to an entity:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DoNotTranslate>, and select either <DoNotTranslate>**APM & services**</DoNotTranslate>, or <DoNotTranslate>**Browser**</DoNotTranslate>, or <DoNotTranslate>**Mobile**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Choose an entity, then click <DoNotTranslate>**Dependencies**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. To drill down further, filter the apps, services, databases, or hosts.

You can filter the dependencies page to view specific things that report to the entity. Dependencies include:

* <DoNotTranslate>**Services**</DoNotTranslate>: [APM](/docs/apm)-monitored applications and services.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Mobile applications**</DoNotTranslate>: your [mobile apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring).
* <DoNotTranslate>**Browser applications**</DoNotTranslate>: your frontend [browser apps](/docs/browser).
* <DoNotTranslate>**External services**</DoNotTranslate>: external services [monitored by APM](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page). External services include out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and any other network calls.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Databases**</DoNotTranslate>: your application's database and cache data. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only the service call is reported to New Relic.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate>: your [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) (servers and hosts).
