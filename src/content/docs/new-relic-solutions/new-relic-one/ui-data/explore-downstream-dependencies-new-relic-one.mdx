For your monitored applications in our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring UI, the **Dependencies** UI page shows a filterable list of all the applications, services, databases, and hosts that New Relic identifies as a connection to that [entity](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic). It shows upstream and downstream dependencies, and provides paths to explore them.

While [service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one) displays an entity-scoped map of an entity's relationships, the **Dependencies** UI page displays your upstream and downstream services in a table. It also uses the same [color coding system used by service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one#alerts) to show you what's performing well and what isn't. 

## Requirements

The **Dependencies** UI page is available for entities monitored by our <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents, our mobile agents, and our browser agents. 

Here are required versions for APM agents:

* [C 1.0.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-sdk-release-notes)
* [Go 1.11 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes)
* [Java 3.9.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
* [.NET 4.2 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes)
* [Node.js 2.0.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes)
* [PHP 4.19.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes)
* [Python 2.38.0.31 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes)
* [Ruby 4.3.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes)

## View dependencies [#access]

To view dependencies for applications, services, databases, and hosts connected to an entity:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com)**, and select either **APM & services**, or **Browser**, or **Mobile**.
2. Choose an entity, then click **Dependencies**.
3. To drill down further, filter the apps, services, databases, or hosts.

You can filter the dependencies page to view specific things that report to the entity. Dependencies include:

* **Services**: [APM](/docs/apm)-monitored applications and services.
* **Mobile applications**: your [mobile apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring).
* **Browser applications**: your frontend [browser apps](/docs/browser).
* **External services**: external services [monitored by APM](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page). External services include out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and any other network calls.
* **Databases**: your application's database and cache data. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only the service call is reported to New Relic.
* **Hosts**: your [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) (servers and hosts).
