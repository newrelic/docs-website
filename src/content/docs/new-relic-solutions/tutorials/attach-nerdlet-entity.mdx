One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the **Apps** page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) in your account.

In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities.

## Before you begin [#begin]

If you haven't already:

* [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup/) for a New Relic account
* [Install and configure the New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==)

## Create a Nerdpack [#create-nerdpack]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Update your CLI:

    ```sh
    nr1 update
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a Nerdpack with the CLI:

    ```sh
    nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet
    ```

    This results in a Nerdpack, called `entity-nerdlet`, which consists of a launcher, called `entity-nerdlet-launcher`, and a Nerdlet, called `entity-nerdlet-nerdlet`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Serve your Nerdpack:

    ```sh
    cd entity-nerdlet
    nr1 nerdpack:serve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Go to [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), and navigate to **Apps**.

    `?nerdpacks=local` is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Under **Your apps**, click your launcher to view your New Relic application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Attach your Nerdlet to entities [#attach-nerdlet]

You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open `nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json`. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add a `context` object with an `entities` array:

    ```json fileName=nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json
    {
        "schemaType": "NERDLET",
        "id": "entity-nerdlet-nerdlet",
        "displayName": "EntityNerdletNerdlet",
        "description": "",
        "context": {
            "entities": [
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add an entity context:

    ```json fileName=nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json
    {
        "schemaType": "NERDLET",
        "id": "entity-nerdlet-nerdlet",
        "displayName": "EntityNerdletNerdlet",
        "description": "",
        "context": {
            "entities": [
                {
                    "domain": "APM",
                    "type": "APPLICATION"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all _application_ entities in the _APM_ domain.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Go to **APM**.

    Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the `?nerdpacks=local` query string.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Choose any of your applications.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application.

    Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure your `entities` context [#configure-entity]

The `context.entities` key in your Nerdlet's `nr1.json` file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to.

### Specify an entity `domain` [#entity-domain]

Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the `domain` as one of the following values:

* `APM`: [Application Performance Monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/)
* `BROWSER`: [Browser](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/)
* `INFRA`: [Infrastructure monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/)
* `MOBILE`: [Mobile monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/)
* `SYNTH`: [Synthetic monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/)

For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the `APM` domain:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "APM"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities _except_ those in a domain:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "!APM"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "APM"},
            {"domain": "BROWSER"}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Specify an entity `type` [#entity-type]

Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the `type` as one of the following values:

* `APPLICATION`
* `HOST`
* `MONITOR`

For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the `APPLICATION` type:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "APPLICATION"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities _except_ those of a specified type:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "!APPLICATION"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "APPLICATION"},
            {"type": "MONITOR"}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Specify entity `tags` [#entity-tags]

Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given [tag](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/).

For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "guid",
                        "values": [
                            "<SOME ENTITY GUID>"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular `accountId` _and_ uses the Python programming language:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "accountId",
                        "values": [
                            "<SOME ACCOUNT ID>"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "language",
                        "values": [
                            "python"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Combine filters [#combine-filters]

When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine `domain`, `type`, and `tags`:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "domain": "APM",
                "type": "APPLICATION",
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "language",
                        "values": [
                            "python"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "domain": "SYNTH",
                "type": "MONITOR"
            },
            {
                "domain": "BROWSER"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to:

* All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the `python` language
* **AND** all Synthetic monitors
* **AND** all Browser entities
