## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Understand service level indicators(SLIs) and service level obectives (SLOs).
* Have created and defined SLIs and SLOs for your front-end experience.
* Have alerts set up to warn of any SLI or SLO breaches so you can react before they impact your users.

## Intro 

[INTRO GOES HERE]

<Steps>
    <Step>
   
    ## Select service level indicators:

    While there are a large amount of SLIs you could use to define your front end experience benchmarks, the following are some we specifically reccomend. Each collapser has an explanation of when you should choose that SLI and a corresponding NRQL query (which you will use in step 2).

    For now, just select one of the following:

    **SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent**:
    Based on `Transaction` events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services:

    <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="service-availability"
        title="Service success"
    >
        Service success is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Bad events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: TransactionError
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error.expected IS FALSE
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="service-latency"
        title="Service latency"
    >
        A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience.

        In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance.

        To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI:

        ```sql
        SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max
        ```

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Good events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web' AND duration < {duration}
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
        * Where `{duration}` is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds.
    </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    **SLIs for APM services instrumented with OpenTelemetry**:
    Based on OpenTelemetry spans, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services:

    <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="otel-availability"
        title="Service success"
    >
        Service success is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Span
        WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer'))
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Bad events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Span
        WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND otel.status_code = 'ERROR'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
    </Collapser>

        WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND duration.ms < {duration}
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
        * Where `{duration}` is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds.

    **SLIs for browser applications**:
    The following SLIs are based on Google's Browser Core Web Vitals.

    <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="browser-availability"
        title="Browser app success"
    >
        It's the proportion of page views that are served without errors.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageView
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Bad events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: JavaScriptError
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstErrorInSession IS true
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="browser-contentful-paint"
        title="Browser app largest contentful paint"
    >
        It’s the proportion of valid page views where the largest content element visible in the viewport was rendered faster than the threshold considered to correspond to a good experience.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND largestContentfulPaint IS NOT NULL
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Good events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND largestContentfulPaint < '{largestContentfulPaint}'
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
        * Where `{largestContentfulPaint}` is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to render the largest content element visible in the viewport that you consider provides a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 4000 ms.

        To determine a realistic number to use for `{largestContentfulPaint}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder:

        ```sql
        SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX
        ```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="browser-first-delay"
        title="Browser app first input delay"
    >
        It’s the proportion of page views where the time between a user's first interacion with the page and the time when the browser responds to that interaction is less than a certain threshold.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstInputDelay IS NOT NULL
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Good events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstInputDelay < {firstInputDelay}
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
        * Where `{firstInputDelay}` is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the browser should respond in to provide a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 300 ms.

        To determine a realistic number to use for `{firstInputDelay}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder:

        ```sql
        SELECT percentile(firstInputDelay, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT MAX FACET deviceType
        ```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="browser-cumulative-shift"
        title="Browser app cumulative layout shift"
    >
        It’s the proportion of page views with a good cumulative layout shift (CLS). CLS is described as the total sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND cumulativeLayoutShift IS NOT NULL
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        If you’d like to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately, add one of these clauses at the end of the field:

        * `and deviceType = 'Mobile'`
        * `and deviceType = 'Desktop'`

        **Good events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: PageViewTiming
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND cumulativeLayoutShift < {cumulativeLayoutShift}
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the browser app GUID.
        * Where `{cumulativeLayoutShift}` is a pre-set value. To provide a good user experience, your site should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. A CLS score of 0.25 or more is considered a poor user experience.

        If you’ve decided to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately when you defined the valid events query, add this clause at the end of the field:

        * `and deviceType = 'Mobile'`
        * `and deviceType = 'Desktop'`

        To determine a realistic number to select for `{cumulativeLayoutShift}` in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 75th percentile of page loads for the last 7 or 15 days, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. Find it by using the query builder:

        ```sql  
        SELECT percentile(cumulativeLayoutShift, 95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE  entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType
        ```
    </Collapser>

    1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Service levels management**. This UI shows all your service levels and allows you to define, monitor, and edit them. 
    2. Select **+ Add a servic level** in the top right of the UI.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Choose the corresponding entity that you want to create a service level for. This could be an entire workload, a specific service, a synthetic monitor, or even a specific transaction. Once you've selected your entity, click **Continue** on the left side of the UI pane.
    </Step>
    
    <Step>

     [UI IMAGE GOES HERE WITH EXAMPLE]   

    Define the SLI you chose in step one in this pane. For example if I chose to define an SLI for browser app success, I would use the following queries:

    **Query for valid events**:
    ```
    FROM: PageView
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
    ```

    **Query for bad events**:
    ```
    FROM: JavaScriptError
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstErrorInSession IS true
    ```

    Select **Continue** in the left pane once you've confirmed your queries are correct.
