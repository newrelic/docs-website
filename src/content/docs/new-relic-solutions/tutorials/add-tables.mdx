Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) you can create tables from [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).

Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic application.

In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic components.

## Before you begin [#begin]

If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the [quick start in New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher). This process also gets you an API key.

In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine.

## Clone and set up the example application [#example]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Clone the [nr1-how-to](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to) example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory.

    The example app lets you experiment with tables.

    ```sh lineNumbers=false copy=false
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git
    cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Edit the `index.js` file and set `this.accountId` to [your Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) as shown in the example.

    ```js lineNumbers=false
    export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component {
        constructor(props){
            super(props)
            this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID;
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Run the demo application [#run-demo]

    Change the directory back to `nr1-how-to/create-a-table`. Before you can load the demo application, you need to [update its unique id](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/guide-to-authentication--data-access--and-permissions) by invoking the New Relic One CLI.

    Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser.

    ```bash
    nr1 update
    nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID
    npm install           # Install dependencies
    nr1 nerdpack:serve    # Serve the demo app locally
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Open the [local New Relic homepage](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) in your browser. Click **Apps**, and then in the **Your apps** section, you should see a **Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it.

    Have a good look at the demo app. There's a `TableChart` on the left side named **Transaction Overview**, with an `AreaChart` next to it. You'll use `Table` components to add a new table in the second row.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Work with table components [#table-components]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file.

    Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example:

    * `Table`
    * `TableHeader`
    * `TableHeaderCell`
    * `TableRow`
    * `TableRowCell`

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    import {
      Table,
      TableHeader,
      TableHeaderCell,
      TableRow,
      TableRowCell,
      PlatformStateContext,
      Grid,
      GridItem,
      HeadingText,
      AreaChart,
      TableChart,
    } from 'nr1';
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add a basic Table component [#basic-table]

    Locate the empty `GridItem` in `index.js`: This is where you start building the table.

    Add the initial `<Table>` component. The `items` property collects the data by calling `_getItems()`, which contains sample values.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={12}>
      <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table>
    </GridItem>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add the header and rows [#add-header-rows]

    As the `Table` component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows.

    Inside the `Table` component, add the `TableHeader` and then a `TableHeaderCell` child for each heading.

    Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many `TableRows` as items returned by `_getItems()`.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    <TableHeader>
      <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell>
      <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell>
      <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell>
      <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell>
      <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell>
    </TableHeader>;
    {
      ({ item }) => (
        <TableRow>
          <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell>
        </TableRow>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Take a look at the application running in New Relic.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Replace standard table cells with smart cells [#replace-cells]

    The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names.

    The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: **Application** (an entity name) and **Size** (a metric).

    Before you can use `EntityTitleTableRowCell` and `MetricTableRowCell`, you have to add them to the import statement first.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false copy=false
    import {
        EntityTitleTableRowCell,
        MetricTableRowCell,
        ... /* All previous components */
    } from 'nr1';

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Update your table rows by replacing the first and second `TableRowCell`s with entity and metric cells.

    Notice that `EntityTitleTableRowCell` are self-closing tags.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    {
      ({ item }) => (
        <TableRow>
          <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} />
          <MetricTableRowCell
            type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX}
            value={item.value}
          />
          <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell>
          <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell>
        </TableRow>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row.

    Add the `_getActions()` method to your `index.js` file, right before `_getItems()`.

    As you may have guessed from the code, `_getActions()` spawns an alert box when you click **Team** or **Commit** cells.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    _getActions() {
        return [
            {
                label: 'Alert Team',
                iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT,
                onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => {
                    alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`);
                },
            },
            {
                label: 'Rollback Version',
                iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO,
                onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => {
                    alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`);
                },
            },
        ];
    }

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Find the `TableRow` component in your `return` statement and point the `actions` property to `_getActions()`.

    The `TableRow` actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an `onClick` callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed.

    ```jsx lineNumbers=false
    <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've built a table into a New Relic application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!
