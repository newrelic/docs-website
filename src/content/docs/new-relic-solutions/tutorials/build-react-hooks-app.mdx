Starting with version 2.49.1 of our `nr1` CLI, you can build New Relic applications and custom visualizations with [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). This guide gives some Nerdlet examples of React hooks in action!

## Before you begin

Developing Nerdpacks requires a New Relic account and the New Relic CLI, `nr1`.

If you haven't already:

- [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup/) for a New Relic account
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Complete the [CLI quick start](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==)

Now, you have a Nerdpack, called `my-awesome-nerdpack`. This Nerdpack has a Nerdlet and a launcher that you named (though, this guide uses the default launcher name, "launcher", and Nerdlet name, "home"). You use this Nerdpack throughout this guide.

Finally, make sure your `nr1` is up-to-date. This guide requires a minimum version of 2.49.1:

```sh
nr1 update
nr1 version
[output] @datanerd/nr1/{purple}2.49.1{normal} darwin-x64 node-v14.15.1
```

If you use VSCode, we have an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=new-relic.nr1) and an [extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=new-relic.new-relic-extension-pack) you can use to build your app.

</Callout>

<Project>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React from 'react';


export default class HomeNerdlet extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, home Nerdlet!</h1>;
  }
}
```

</Project>

## Update and serve your application locally

With `nr1`, you can serve a local build of your Nerdpack to New Relic. This helps you develop your application in a production-like environment before you publish it.

Before you change any code, familiarize yourself with the Nerdpack's directory structure:

<>

```txt lineHighlight=3-10,12
my-awesome-nerdpack/
├───README.md
├───launchers/
│   └───launcher/
│       └───nr1.json
├───nerdlets/
│   └───home
│       ├───index.js
│       ├───nr1.json
│       └───styles.scss
├───node_modules/
├───nr1.json
├───package-lock.json
└───package.json
```

</>

The _launchers_ and _nerdlets_ directories contain the logic of your application. It's in these directories that you update most of your code. The _nr1.json_ files throughout the Nerdpack hold metadata about your Nerdpack, Nerdlets, and launchers.

<Callout variant="tip">

Read [our documentation](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/nerdpack-file-structure/) to learn more about the Nerdpack file structure.

</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>

In _my-awesome-nerdpack/nerdlets/home/index.js_, change the _HomeNerdlet_ class to a function:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React from 'react';

function HomeNerdlet () {
    return <h1>Hello, home Nerdlet!</h1>;
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Next, return a Billboard chart instead of a header:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React from 'react';
import { BillboardChart} from 'nr1'

function HomeNerdlet () {

  const clickCount = {
    metadata: {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Count',
        viz: 'main',
    },
    data: [
      { "y": 10 }
    ]
  }
  return <BillboardChart data={[clickCount]}/>
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

<br />

For now, you're showing a static value in your Billboard chart, but in later steps, you supply a dynamic value using the function's local state.

</Step>

<Step>

If you're not already, serve your application from the root directory of your Nerdpack:

```bash

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Use the url at the bottom of the output to open your launcher:

[output]  {blue}ℹ  {plain}You can use "npm start -- --mode=prod" to run the development server in prod mode.
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Here, you see your Nerdlet with your Billboard chart showing the number "10":

<img
  title="Static billboard chart in the browser"
  alt="Static billboard chart in the browser"
  src={staticBillboard}
/>

</Step>

</Steps>

Leave your server running, as it will automatically reload your Nerdlet when you modify its files.

## Use the `useState()` hook in your Nerdlet

Previously, you used a static value for your Billboard chart. Now, you use your function's local state to store a dynamic value and show that value in the chart.

<Steps>

<Step>

In _my-awesome-nerdpack/nerdlets/home/index.js_, call `useState()` in your function component:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { BillboardChart} from 'nr1'

function HomeNerdlet () {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const clickCount = {
    metadata: {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Count',
        viz: 'main',
    },
    data: [
      { "y": 10 }
    ]
  }
  return <BillboardChart data={[clickCount]}/>
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

<br />

Here, you call `useState()`. This hook returns two values, which you capture in an array:

- `count`: The current value in local state. Its default value is 0, the argument you passed to `useState()`.
- `setCount`: A function you use to update `count`

</Step>

<Step>

Change your Billboard chart data to use `count`:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { BillboardChart} from 'nr1'

function HomeNerdlet () {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const clickCount = {
    metadata: {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Count',
        viz: 'main',
    },
    data: [
      { "y": count }
    ]
  }
  return <BillboardChart data={[clickCount]}/>
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

<br />

Right now, the value of count will be `0` on every render because you never update the state. You need a way to do that.

</Step>

<Step>

Alongside your chart, render a button to increment `count`:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { BillboardChart} from 'nr1'

function HomeNerdlet () {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const clickCount = {
    metadata: {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Count',
        viz: 'main',
    },
    data: [
      { "y": count }
    ]
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <BillboardChart data={[clickCount]}/>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

<br />

Here, you added a button to your Nerdlet that increments the count by 1 every time you click it.

</Step>

<Step>

Move to your browser that's running the Nerdlet to see your changes:

<img
  title="Increment count with button click"
  alt="Increment count with button click"
  src={buttonIncrement}
/>

Click the button a few times to increment the count.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Use the `useEffect()` hook in your Nerdlet

Your Nerdlet now has a Billboard chart and a button. The chart shows the number of times you clicked the button. Use `useEffect()` to automatically increment `count`.

<Steps>

<Step>

In _my-awesome-nerdpack/nerdlets/home/index.js_, create an effect:

<>

```jsx fileName=index.js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
import { BillboardChart} from 'nr1'

function HomeNerdlet () {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount(() => count + 1);
    }, 1000);
  });

  const clickCount = {
    metadata: {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Count',
        viz: 'main',
    },
    data: [
      { "y": count }
    ]
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <BillboardChart data={[clickCount]}/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomeNerdlet
```

</>

<br />

`useEffect()` automatically increments the `count` value every 1 second. Since you automated the count, you also removed the increment button.

</Step>

<Step>

Move to your browser to see the updates:

<img
  title="Auto increment with Effect Hook"
  alt="Auto increment with Effect Hook"
  src={autoIncrement}
/>

</Step>

</Steps>
