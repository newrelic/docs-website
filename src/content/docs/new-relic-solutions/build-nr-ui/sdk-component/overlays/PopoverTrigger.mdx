Child element of the `<Popover>` component.

Controls the opening/closing of the Popover overlay.

### Usage

```js
import { PopoverTrigger } from 'nr1'
```

### Props

      <td>
        `children` <h5>REQUIRED</h5> <h5>node|function</h5>
      </td>

      <td>
        This component can render in two ways, by directly passing a children React element, or by passing a render callback (function as children).When passing a React element directly, you can either use some of the compatible NR1 SDK Components like `<TextField>`, `<Button>`... or use your own Component.When using a render callback, you will receive an object of the following shape as an argument `{ opened: boolean, controlled: boolean }`.No matter if you're passing components directly or using a render callback, when rendering your own component as trigger, it should always expose a `focus` method in order to work properly.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
