</Callout>

Before you build your New Relic application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services:

* A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions.
* A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data

To spin up your demo services, you first need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Spin up your demo services [#spin]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Clone the [coursework repository](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course) from GitHub:

    <>
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course
      ```
    </>

    This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Change to the demo directory, called `ab-test-app`:

    <>
      ```sh
      cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app
      ```
    </>

    This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using `docker-compose`:

    <>
      ```sh
      NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY docker-compose up -d
      ```
    </>

    <Callout variant="important">
      Make sure you replace `YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` with your actual [license key](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key/).
    </Callout>

    Once it's finished, view the website at `localhost:3001`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Visit [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com), and navigate to **APM** in the top navigation menu. Select **Newsletter** from the list of instrumented services.

    You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to receive data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    To spin down your demo services, run `docker-compose down` from your `ab-test-app` directory:

    <>
      ```sh
      docker-compose down
      ```
    </>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now you're ready to build your New Relic application!
