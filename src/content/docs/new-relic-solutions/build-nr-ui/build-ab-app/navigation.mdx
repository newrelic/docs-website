<Callout variant="course">

This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the [course introduction](/ab-test).

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, [_Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet_](/build-apps/ab-test/platform-state-context), before starting this one.

</Callout>

</HideWhenEmbedded>

In the last lesson, you used `PlatformStateContext` from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: `navigation`.

The `navigation` component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use `navigation` for other Nerdlets and launchers.

<Steps>

<Step>

Change to the _add-navigation/ab-test_ directory of the [coursework repository](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course):

<>

```sh
cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test
```
</>

This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next.

</Step>

<Step>

In _newsletter-signups.js_, create a new method, called `NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity()`:

<>

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js lineHighlight=7,13-15
import React from 'react';
import {
    HeadingText,
    LineChart,
    NrqlQuery,
    PlatformStateContext,
    navigation,
} from 'nr1';

const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567  // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>

export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component {
    openAPMEntity() {
        navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID)
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <HeadingText className="chartHeader">
                Newsletter subscriptions per version
            </HeadingText>
            <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                {
                    (platformState) => {
                        return <NrqlQuery
                            accountIds={[ACCOUNT_ID]}
                            query="SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES"
                            timeRange={platformState.timeRange}
                            pollInterval={60000}
                        >
                            {
                                ({ data }) => {
                                    return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />;
                                }
                            }
                        </NrqlQuery>
                    }
                }
            </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
        </div>
    }
}
```
</>

<Callout variant="important">

Make sure you replace `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id).

</Callout>

This method uses `navigation.openStackedEntity()` to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice `openApmEntity()` requires your `ENTITY_GUID`. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant.

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to **APM**:

![APM navigation](../../../images/ab-test/select-apm.png)

See metadata for your **Newsletter** service:

![Entity options](../../../images/ab-test/entity-metadata.png)

Copy the entity's GUID:

![Entity GUID](../../../images/ab-test/entity-guid.png)

Create an `ENTITY_GUID` constant:

<>

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js lineHighlight=11
import React from 'react';
import {
    HeadingText,
    LineChart,
    NrqlQuery,
    PlatformStateContext,
    navigation,
} from 'nr1';

const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567  // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>
const ENTITY_GUID = "<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>"

export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component {
    openAPMEntity() {
        navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID)
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <HeadingText className="chartHeader">
                Newsletter subscriptions per version
            </HeadingText>
            <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                {
                    (platformState) => {
                        return <NrqlQuery
                            accountIds={[ACCOUNT_ID]}
                            query="SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES"
                            timeRange={platformState.timeRange}
                            pollInterval={60000}
                        >
                            {
                                ({ data }) => {
                                    return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />;
                                }
                            }
                        </NrqlQuery>
                    }
                }
            </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
        </div>
    }
}
```
</>

<Callout variant="important">

Make sure you replace `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` and `<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>` with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively.

</Callout>

Now, `openApmEntity()` knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method.

</Step>

<Step>

Create a button to show your APM entity:

<>

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js lineHighlight=3,24-26
import React from 'react';
import {
    Button,
    HeadingText,
    LineChart,
    NrqlQuery,
    PlatformStateContext,
    navigation,
} from 'nr1';

const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567  // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>
const ENTITY_GUID = "<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>"

export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component {
    openAPMEntity() {
        navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID)
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <HeadingText className="chartHeader">
                Newsletter subscriptions per version
            </HeadingText>
            <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}>
                App performance
            </Button>
            <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                {
                    (platformState) => {
                        return <NrqlQuery
                            accountIds={[ACCOUNT_ID]}
                            query="SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES"
                            timeRange={platformState.timeRange}
                            pollInterval={60000}
                        >
                            {
                                ({ data }) => {
                                    return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />;
                                }
                            }
                        </NrqlQuery>
                    }
                }
            </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
        </div>
    }
}
```
</>

<Callout variant="important">

Make sure you replace `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` and `<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>` with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) and entity GUID, respectively.

</Callout>

Here, you've created a button and configured it to call `openApmEntity()` when it's clicked.

</Step>

<Step>

Import `Stack` and `StackItem`:

<>

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js lineHighlight=8-9
import React from 'react';
import {
    Button,
    HeadingText,
    LineChart,
    NrqlQuery,
    PlatformStateContext,
    Stack,
    StackItem,
    navigation,
} from 'nr1';

const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567  // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>
const ENTITY_GUID = "<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>"

export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component {
    openAPMEntity() {
        navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID)
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <HeadingText className="chartHeader">
                Newsletter subscriptions per version
            </HeadingText>
            <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}>
                App performance
            </Button>
            <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                {
                    (platformState) => {
                        return <NrqlQuery
                            accountIds={[ACCOUNT_ID]}
                            query="SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES"
                            timeRange={platformState.timeRange}
                            pollInterval={60000}
                        >
                            {
                                ({ data }) => {
                                    return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />;
                                }
                            }
                        </NrqlQuery>
                    }
                }
            </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
        </div>
    }
}
```
</>

<Callout variant="important">

Make sure you replace `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` and `<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>` with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) and entity GUID, respectively.

</Callout>

You'll use `Stack` and `StackItem` to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the `HeadingText` is on.

</Step>

<Step>

Lay out the `Stack`:

<>

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js lineHighlight=23-34
import React from 'react';
import {
    Button,
    HeadingText,
    LineChart,
    NrqlQuery,
    PlatformStateContext,
    Stack,
    StackItem,
    navigation,
} from 'nr1';

const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567  // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>
const ENTITY_GUID = "<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>"

export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component {
    openAPMEntity() {
        navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID)
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <Stack fullWidth>
                <StackItem grow={true}>
                    <HeadingText className="chartHeader">
                        Newsletter subscriptions per version
                    </HeadingText>
                </StackItem>
                <StackItem>
                    <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}>
                        App performance
                    </Button>
                </StackItem>
            </Stack>
            <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                {
                    (platformState) => {
                        return <NrqlQuery
                            accountIds={[ACCOUNT_ID]}
                            query="SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES"
                            timeRange={platformState.timeRange}
                            pollInterval={60000}
                        >
                            {
                                ({ data }) => {
                                    return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />;
                                }
                            }
                        </NrqlQuery>
                    }
                }
            </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
        </div>
    }
}
```
</>

<Callout variant="important">

Make sure you replace `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` and `<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>` with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) and entity GUID, respectively.

</Callout>

Here, you used a full-width `Stack` to set up the layout for the row. To make the `HeadingText` fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the `StackItem.grow` prop.

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at _nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test_.

</Step>

<Step>

Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack:

<>

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
```
</>

Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account.

</Step>

<Step>

[Serve your application locally](/build-apps/publish-deploy/serve):

<>

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```
</>

</Step>

<Step>

Go to [https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local), and view your application under **Apps > Your apps**.

Click **App performance**:

![Your New Relic application with an App performance button](../../../images/ab-test/performance-button.png)

Now you see the stacked entity:

![APM stacked entity](../../../images/ab-test/stacked-entity.png)

<Callout variant="tip">

If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem.

**Make sure you:**

- Copied the code correctly from the lesson
- Generated a new UUID
- Replaced all instances of `<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>` and `<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>` in your project with your actual New Relic [account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) and entity GUID, respectively

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view.

On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view.

You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic application development.
