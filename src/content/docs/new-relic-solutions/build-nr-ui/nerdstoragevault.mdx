To help you build a New Relic application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you'll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution.

## Using NerdStorageVault in your apps [#using]

Use NerdStorageVault to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as:

* personal access tokens
* license keys
* API keys
* other third party secrets

<Callout variant="tip">
  NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption.
</Callout>

## Usage considerations [#usage]

* This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack.
* NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack.
* You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault.
* You can explore the fields and response types via the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
* The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user.

## Component library [#component]

Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of [Nr1 Community component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/nr1-community/v/1.3.0-alpha.5) and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality.

## NerdGraph queries [#nerdgraph]

Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault.
