  This procedure is a part of course that teaches you how to build a quickstart. If you haven't already, checkout the [course introduction](/docs/new-relic-solutions/build-nr-ui/contribute-nr-io/contribute-quickstart).

  As this procedure builds on top of the last ones in the lab, make sure you[create a dashboard](/docs/new-relic-solutions/build-nr-ui/contribute-nr-io/create-a-dashboard) and [create alerts](/docs/new-relic-solutions/build-nr-ui/contribute-nr-io/create-alerts/) before proceeding with this one.

Before you proceed with creating a quickstart, you need to understand its directory structure.

To get started, navigate to GitHub repository of New Relic quickstarts and fork it. Then, clone your own repository to your local machine using `git clone` and open it in the IDE of your choice.

At the root of your cloned project, the directories within the `\_template` folder mirror the directories in the top level of the repository and contains the templates for the respective observability building blocks in the quickstart.

With the recent update to the structure of quickstarts, the `\_template` directory now has the following structure:

```
alert-policies/
    example-alert-policy/
        baseline-alert.yml
        static-alert.yml

dashboards/
    example-dashboard/
        example-dashboard.json
        example-dashboard.png

data-sources/
    example-data-source/
        config.yml
        logo.svg

quickstarts/
    example-quickstart/
        config.yml
        logo.svg
```

Each of these directories contain templates that you can use to create entities for your quickstart. The structure of new contributions should match the structure seen here. You refer the associated dashboardas and alerts in quickstarts `config.yml`.

In order to build a quickstart, you first need to add it's entities like dashboard and alerts to quickstart.
