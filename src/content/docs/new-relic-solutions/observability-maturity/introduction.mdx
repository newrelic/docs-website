New Relic's **Observability maturity** practice is about making our customers successful in one or more of the value drivers shown in the diagram on the right. This practice aims to identify common customer needs, articulate them, and define a path forward to meet them. In this section of docs you'll find:

* Use case implementation guides. Each implementation guide defines KPIs to measure and improve as well as how to improve them. The value realization section in each guide outlines the value of the use case to practitioners and to the business.
* Reference guides. These are referenced within the implementation guides. They explain industry concepts in greater detail or cover how to do something, such as improve a specific KPI.
* Links to self-paced training and hands-on labs.

The content in these resources comes from industry best practices, our experiences consulting with customers, as well as our own experiences as software engineers, operations engineers, and SREs. It's open source, and we'd love to include your contributions. We're always looking for new use cases and new visualizations. We'd love you to help us build out [new best practices](/docs/style-guide/writing-docs/article-templates/om-implementation-guide).
