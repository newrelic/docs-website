# Overview

This rule provides a score based on the presence of team tags within your systems estate. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your tagging strategy.

# Description

The score is based on the most recent entity scan and fails if the target entity does not have a value for their “team” tag.

# Interpretation

The use of metadata or semantic conventions, specifically the team tag, can significantly improve how groups organize and coordinate their alerting strategies. This is especially important in environments where multiple teams are responsible for delivering business services.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review and Document Tagging Approach:*** Assess your environments based on geographical, functional, or end-user audience-specific segmentations. Ensure these are well represented in your tagging strategy.
- ***Edit Rule for Tagging Semantics:*** Modify the rule to align with the tagging semantics your organization chooses to employ for teams. Consider including operational support teams, business ownership teams, scrum teams, tribes, etc.
- ***Agent Deployment Options:*** Review agent deployment options favored by your organization. Include agent-defined tags through environment variables or agent configuration extensions.
- ***Evaluate Sources of Tags:*** Explore sources of tags and metadata for potential synchronization tooling, such as ServiceNow, or cloud integrations.
- ***Create a Tagging Strategy:*** Develop a comprehensive tagging strategy for your organization. This should cover the importance of consistent tagging and how it can aid in better system management and alert coordination.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your tagging strategy to align with your organizational structure and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Tagging strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your team tagging compliance and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
