# Overview

Your recent scorecard evaluation has provided a score based on the detection of uninstrumented entities within your service delivery estate. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to achieve full coverage.

# Description

The score is based on the unknown relationships reported for HTTPSERVICE and DATABASE entity types. If there are more than one unknown related entities, the rule fails for the given entity.

# Interpretation

This rule identifies entities that may benefit from supplemental instrumentation to fully develop their relationship graph. The goal is to achieve sufficient visibility between dependent systems to manage the volatility of service behavior due to limitations in dependent systems.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Prioritize Non-compliant Entities:*** Rank non-compliant entities by their criticality to your business and the complexity of technical implementation. Focus initial review efforts on the most critical entities.
- ***Identify Recurring Uninstrumented Entities:*** Create a list of entities that consistently lack representation by entity telemetry in New Relic.
- ***Develop Instrumentation Strategy:*** Formulate a strategy to deploy additional agents or acquire representative telemetry from unknown entities.
- ***Feasibility of Custom Telemetry Collection:*** Assess the feasibility of creating bespoke telemetry collection for unknown entities. Consider using synthetics for testing, Flex to query the state of missing dependencies if available, or developing a novel agent.
- ***Deploy and Assess New Telemetry Options:*** Implement new telemetry capture solutions and conduct a before/after assessment to demonstrate improvements to your organization.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your instrumentation strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Instrumentation strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your entity instrumentation coverage and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
