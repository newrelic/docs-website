# Overview

This rule provides a score based on the presence of environment tags within your systems estate. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your tagging strategy.

# Description

The score is based on the most recent entity scan and fails if the target entity does not have a value for their “environment” tag.

# Interpretation

A low score on this rule may indicate that your organization hasn't fully implemented metadata or semantic conventions for your systems estate. The environment tag is crucial for improving organizational clarity within the observability platform, helping to distinguish between different operational contexts such as production, staging, or geographical regions.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review and Document Tagging Approach:*** Assess your environments based on geographical, functional, or end-user audience-specific segmentations. Ensure these are well represented in your tagging strategy.
- ***Edit Rule for Tagging Semantics:*** Modify the rule to align with the tagging semantics your organization chooses to employ. Include multiple tags or specific expected tag values (e.g., production, staging, eu, aws, cloud) for the candidate environment and adjacent tags.
- ***Agent Deployment Options:*** Review agent deployment options favored by your organization. Include agent-defined tags through environment variables or agent configuration extensions.
- ***Evaluate Sources of Tags:*** Explore sources of tags and metadata for potential synchronization tooling, such as ServiceNow, or cloud integrations.
- ***Account Organization:*** Ensure like systems are effectively grouped. Create workloads featuring environment tags to review the completeness of segments of identified environments.
- ***Create a Tagging Strategy:*** Develop a comprehensive tagging strategy for your organization. This should cover the importance of consistent tagging and how it can aid in better system management and organizational clarity.


# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your tagging strategy to align with your organizational structure and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Tagging strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your environment tagging compliance and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
