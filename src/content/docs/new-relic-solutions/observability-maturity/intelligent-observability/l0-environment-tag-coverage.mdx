This rule provides a score based on the presence of environment tags within your systems estate. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your tagging strategy.

## Description

The score is based on the most recent entity scan and fails if the target entity does not have a value for their “environment” tag.

## How to interpret your score

Your environment tag coverage score reflects the percentage of entities in your system that have proper environment tagging. Here's how to understand your results:

- **High score (80-100%)**: Most entities are properly tagged, indicating mature tagging practices
- **Medium score (50-79%)**: Moderate coverage with opportunities to improve consistency
- **Low score (0-49%)**: Limited environment tagging that may hinder system organization and troubleshooting

A low score often indicates that your organization hasn't fully implemented metadata standards or semantic conventions across your infrastructure. This can make it difficult to:
- Quickly identify which environment an issue affects
- Apply environment-specific monitoring and alerting rules
- Organize and filter your observability data effectively

<Callout variant="important">
  Environment tags are critical for operational clarity. Without them, incidents in production might be confused with staging issues, leading to delayed response times and potential business impact.

## Recommended actions

Use these strategies to improve your environment tag coverage score:

### 1. Review and document your tagging approach

Start by establishing clear tagging standards:
- Define your environment categories (e.g., production, staging, development, testing)
- Consider geographical segments (e.g., us-east, eu-west, asia-pacific)
- Account for functional divisions (e.g., customer-facing, internal, experimental)
- Document your tagging conventions and share them with your teams

### 2. Customize the rule for your organization

Adapt the scorecard rule to match your specific requirements:
- Modify the rule to include your organization's specific tag values
- Add validation for multiple environment-related tags if needed
- Include adjacent tags that provide context (e.g., region, cluster, team)
- Set up rules that expect specific tag formats or naming conventions

### 3. Implement consistent agent deployment practices

Ensure tags are applied systematically across your infrastructure:
- Use environment variables to set tags during agent deployment
- Configure agent extensions to automatically apply environment tags
- Implement infrastructure-as-code practices that include tagging
- Create deployment templates that enforce consistent tagging

### 4. Leverage external data sources

Explore automated tagging from your existing systems:
- Integrate with cloud provider tagging (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Sync tags from configuration management databases like ServiceNow
- Use Kubernetes labels and annotations for containerized environments
- Connect with CI/CD pipelines to automatically tag deployed services

### 5. Organize and validate your tagging strategy

Create processes to maintain tag quality over time:
- Group similar systems using workloads that filter by environment tags
- Regularly audit tag completeness across different environment segments
- Create dashboards to monitor tagging compliance
- Establish team responsibilities for maintaining tags in different environments

### 6. Develop a comprehensive tagging strategy

Build organizational alignment around tagging:
- Create tagging guidelines that cover naming conventions and required tags
- Train teams on the importance of consistent tagging practices
- Establish processes for tag governance and quality control
- Document how tags support incident response and system management

## Important considerations

Keep these factors in mind when working with your environment tag coverage score:

**Customize for your organization**: Scorecard rules provide general guidance, but your specific environment structure may differ. Evaluate results based on your operational needs, organizational structure, and deployment patterns.

**Focus on continuous improvement**: Tagging strategies should evolve with your infrastructure and organizational changes. Regularly review your approach to ensure tags remain relevant and useful as your systems grow and change.

**Balance standardization with flexibility**: While consistency is important, allow for environment-specific needs. Some services may require additional tags that others don't need, and that's acceptable as long as core environment tags are present.

**Consider automation**: Manual tagging is error-prone and doesn't scale. Invest in automated tagging solutions that integrate with your deployment pipelines and infrastructure management tools.

## Next steps

To improve your environment tag coverage:

1. **Start small**: Begin with your most critical production services and ensure they have proper environment tags
2. **Automate where possible**: Integrate tagging into your deployment processes to ensure consistency
3. **Monitor progress**: Use the scorecard to track improvements over time
4. **Expand gradually**: Once core services are tagged, extend to development and staging environments

Consistent environment tagging creates a foundation for effective observability, faster incident response, and better system organization across your entire infrastructure.
