# Overview

Intelligent observability is foundational to all of New Relic’s business outcome value drivers. To put it in as simple terms as possible, it’s about the deployment, configuration, and management practices that will allow you to be successful with your observability program goals. It attempts to ensure you have comprehensively acquired telemetry from all elements of your service delivery estate and developed naming and organizational principles that ensure consistency.

# Maturity progression model

As indicated above, "intelligent observability” is our foundational maturity level. Outcomes are related to deployment, characterization, and observability estate meta-data management. Getting proficient with the management capabilities at this foundational step will greatly improve your success as you transition to more sophisticated observability objectives. The rules below are captured in the related scorecard to help measure and improve your fundemental observability design. 

## Level 0: Intelligent observability 

- ***[Team tag coverage](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/intelligent-observability/l0-team-tag-coverage):*** Ensuring entities are well tagged with an owning team or function within your organization.
- ***[Environment tag coverage](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/intelligent-observability/l0-environment-tag-coverage):*** Ensure entities are well tagged with a related environment or system component that they are representative of. 
- ***[Uninstrumented entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/intelligent-observability/l0-uninstrumented-entities):*** Evaluates service entities for unknown relationships, allowing you to reduce blindspots in your systems estate. 
- ***[Distributed trace coverage](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/intelligent-observability/l0-distributed-trace-coverage):*** Evaluates if you’re using distributed tracing to model the related  end-to-end behaviour of service delivery systems. 
- ***[Synthetic coverage](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/intelligent-observability/l0-synthetic-coverage):*** Evaluates if service delivery entities are being routinely checked to ensure uptime and quality of service. 


# Observability practices

Observability practices related to the foundational level of intelligent observability form the actionable components of the maturity model, enabling organizations to realize the potential value of the New Relic platform. These practices include:

- ***[Service characterization (SC)](/docs/tutorial-reporting-data/capture-the-right-data):*** capture the right web telemetry to resolve poor customer experiences.
- ***[Data ingest governance (DG)](/docs/tutorial-optimize-telemetry/intro-to-optimal-telemetry):*** ensure overall value for the telemetry data you collect with New Relic.
- ***[Observability as code (OaC)](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/observability-as-code-guide):*** automate the configuration of your tools for consistency and value.

The New Relic Observability platform provides a structured approach to the practices that you will need to adopt to deliver an effective observability program. Starting with foundational visibility and moving through the reactive, proactive, and mastery levels of maturity model, foundational practices such as service characterization, data ingest governance, and observability as code will help to improve your observability program outcomes.


# Next steps 

Organizations are encouraged to explore New Relic's resources and guides to tailor their observability journey according to their specific needs. Selecting an observability value driver such as business observability, engineering efficiency, or digital experience is an excellent way to identify your program goals and begin to progress through the maturity levels indicated therein.
