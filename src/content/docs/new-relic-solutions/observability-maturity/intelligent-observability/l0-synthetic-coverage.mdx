# Overview

This rule evaluates the percentage of APM entities covered by synthetics, which is crucial for preventing blind spots in telemetry coverage and assessing service delivery outcomes. Use this rule to help close critical gaps in Synthetics coverage, optimize your monitoring strategy, and improve user experience and outage preparedness.


# Description

The rule is successful if it detects an APM service with web transactions using New Relic synthetics to test the availability of endpoints.

# Interpretation

This rule determines the percentage of APM entities with coverage from synthetics. If an APM entity exposes a URI, it should be considered for potential testing to ensure quality and consistency of service delivery. The inclusion of synthetics provides an opportunity for setting service delivery expectations and performing cohort analysis. Without this telemetry, there is a notable blind spot in the overall telemetry coverage for a web-based service.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Conduct Criticality/Complexity Assessment:*** Prioritize the most important APM services within your estate by assessing their criticality and complexity. Ensure synthetics tests bias towards the most critical services.

- ***Identify Services for Endpoint Testing:*** Determine which services would benefit from endpoint testing using synthetics to ensure user experience and provide advance warning of potential outages.

- ***Tag and Augment Rule for Specific Services:*** Consider tagging the cohort of services that synthetics should apply to and modify the scorecard rule to reflect this population of services.


# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your synthetics strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Synthetic testing and monitoring strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your distributed tracing coverage and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
