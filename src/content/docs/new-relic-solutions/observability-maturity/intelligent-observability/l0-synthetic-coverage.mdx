# Overview

Your recent scorecard evaluation has provided a score based on the presence of span data from APM entities. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to optimize distributed tracing within your systems.

# Description

The score evaluates the percentage of APM entities exhibiting distributed trace data. The rule is successful if span data is detected from these entities.

# Interpretation

This rule helps determine the extent to which your APM entities are providing distributed trace data. While the goal may not be to include all entities as sources, focus should be on those with significant service-to-service dependencies.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Conduct Criticality/Complexity Assessment:*** Collaborate with your team to identify services and transactions core to your business operations. Ensure these services are well-described with distributed trace data.
- ***Prioritize Distributed Trace Configuration:*** Focus on configuring distributed tracing for critical services with known and complex dependencies.
- ***Evaluate Span Capture:*** Assess whether spans are being effectively captured with all available context attributes.
- ***Prepare Coverage Report:*** Document the coverage of critical services and their dependencies. Highlight any gaps that may require additional agent deployments.
- ***Tagging and Rule Modification:*** Consider tagging the cohort of services where distributed tracing should be applied. Modify the Scorecard Rule to target this specific cohort.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your distributed tracing strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Distributed tracing strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your distributed tracing coverage and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
