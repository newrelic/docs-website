**Data ingest governance** is a practice of getting optimal value for the telemetry data collected by an organization. This is especially important for a complex organization that has numerous business units and working groups. This is the second part of a four-part guide to optimizing your New Relic data ingest. 

For this stage of your data ingest governance practice, it's necessary to get a high level view of all of the telemetry currently being generated by your organization. The unit focuses on breaking down ingest stats into various groups such as account, telemetry type, and application. These figures will be used to inform the [Optimize your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-optimizing) and [Forecast your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-growth) stages.

You'll learn how to generate a structured breakdown report for the following dimensions:
* Organization
* Specific accounts in your organization
* Billable telemetry type

In addition you'll learn how to create highly granular breakdowns including:
* Application (APM | browser | mobile)
* Kubernetes cluster
* Infrastructure integration

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]

Understand exactly which groups within your organization are contributing which types of data and how much.

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

All billable telemetry is tracked with our `NrConsumption` and `NrMTDConsumption` events. This guide focuses on how to query `NrConsumption`, which provides more granular, real-time data than `NrMTDConsumption`. The `NrConsumption` attribute `usageMetric` denotes the telemetry type.

Using `NrConsumption`, you can ask questions like "How much browser monitoring data has each account ingested in the last 30 days?" and "How has the ingest changed since the previous 30 days?" Here's a query returning that data:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE usageMetric = 'BrowserEventsBytes' SINCE 30 days AGO COMPARE WITH 30 days AGO FACET consumingAccountName
```

The response shows you how many GBs of browser monitoring data you've ingested by account.

```shell
Banking platform, 75 GB, +2.9%
Marketing platform, 40 GB, -1.3%
```

Below is a breakdown of the different `usageMetric` types, the constituent events (event types where the data is stored), and the type of agent or mechanism responsible for creating the data ingest.

For the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), which is usage-based, telemetry data and users both contribute to your usage and cost. This guide is focused on maximizing the value of telemetry data. The mention of users in this section is to help you understand different options for balancing users and data.

There are three general types of usage plans. Your usage plan may affect how you set ingest targets for your organization.

### Annual pool of funds 

If you have an [annual pool of funds](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) agreement, you'll likely have a monthly target budget for data ingest. For example, you may have set a target of 5TB per day and 100 full platform users. In this type of plan data, users can be "traded off" but it's best to discuss this with other stakeholders in your organization to ensure you're getting the right mix for your observability goals. Although some customers will plan for variability in their consumption during the year, let's assume for now our monthly consumption budget is your total annual pool of funds amount divided by 12.

If you know the number of full platform users and core users you need, you can use this formula:

```sql
(monthly_target_spend - (num_fso_users*per_fso_cost) - (num_core_users*per_core_cost))/<var>YOUR_INGESTED_DATA_COST</var>
```

Not sure of your data cost? See [Ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices). 

### Pay-as-you-go

In a [pay-as-you-go plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#usage-plans) you'll not have a predetermined yearly commit however, you'll likely have an understood limit to your monthly spend. In this model, you'd do the following to determine your target ingest:

```sql
(monthly_target_spend - (num_fso_users*per_fso_cost) - (num_core_users*per_core_cost))/<var>YOUR_INGESTED_DATA_COST</var>
```

Not sure of your data cost? See [Ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices). 

### Free option on Standard edition

For our Standard edition, you can get up to 100GB data ingest per month for free. If you're currently working in a free account, you can consider 100GB your monthly ingest target. In a free account any additional data ingested over 100GB per month is billed at $0.25 per GB.

For more on these topics, see [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing).

Use the `rate` operator when you need to take a sample of data pulled from a certain time period and produce a given rate. For example, take a daily sample of data and compute a 30 day rate based on that.
</Callout>

_Compute rate based on a given sample of data_

See what your daily average ingest has been for the past month.

```sql
SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS 'Daily Ingest Rate (GB)' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' LIMIT MAX SINCE 30 days AGO
```

Our simple response for the entire organization is

```shell
Daily ingest rate: 30.4 k
```

This query shows that the daily ingest rate was approximately 30 TB per day for the last month.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="the-month-of-operator"
        title="MonthOf"
      >
<Callout
  variant="IMPORTANT"
  title="When to use"
>
Use this when it's important to constrain an ingest calculation to specific calendar months. For example, ingest for an integration may have increased in late January and continued through mid February. This operator will help facet the ingest to the specific calendar months used for billing.
</Callout>

_Facet by calendar month_

```sql
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) AS 'Daily Ingest Rate (GB)' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' FACET monthOf(timestamp) LIMIT MAX SINCE 56 weeks AGO
```

The resulting table shows fairly high variability. Note that things were fairly `hot` in August and September. Some of that is our organization seasonality but also was related to some increasing the breadth of our telemetry coverage.

```shell
|MONTH OF TIMESTAMP|GB INGESTED|
|---|---|
|December 2021*|636 k|
|November 2021|901 k|
|October 2021|873 k|
|September 2021|1.05 M|
|August 2021|1.08 M|

|June 2021|887 k|
|May 2021|881 k|

</Callout>

Telemetry is inherently noisy. Real world phenomena happen in spurts leaving many random peaks and troughs in the signal. This is good in a way as it lets us view the full complexity of a phenomenon. However, when we're seeking to see trends, we can be distracted by detail. NRQL provides a powerful way to smooth out any time series by combining each data point with slightly older points. This let's us focus on the overall temporal trend rather than one extreme `increase` or `decrease`.

Note the jaggedness of the raw timeseries for 1 day ingest rate:

```sql
FROM NrConsumption SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 26 weeks AGO TIMESERIES 1 DAY
```

<img
    src={slidingwindowjaggedexample}
    alt="Daily rate time series without smoothing."
    title="Daily rate time series without smoothing."
/>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>

Now if we use a [sliding window](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/create-smoother-charts-sliding-windows/) of four days to reduce the impact of single day events we'll see a clearer picture. Four days is a good choice since it will blur the impact of `weekends`, so data for a Sunday will be combined somewhat with data for a Friday, etc.

```sql
FROM NrConsumption SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' since 26 weeks ago TIMESERIES 1 DAY SLIDE BY 4 days
```

<img
    src={slidingwindowsmoothexample}

</Callout>

NRQL provides us with some tools to assess the rate of change. This is useful because, as we see in the previous example, we had a very large increase over the past several months in browser metrics. This rate of change analysis uses the `derivative` operator and it gives us some confidence that the main growth happened back in early September. It seems as though our growth rate based on the 7 day derivative is somewhat negative so we may have reached a new plateau at the moment in BrowserEventsBytes ingest.

```sql
SELECT derivative(sum(GigabytesIngested) , 7 day) FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'  and usageMetric = 'BrowserEventsBytes'  LIMIT MAX SINCE 3 MONTHS AGO UNTIL THIS MONTH TIMESERIES 1 MONTH slide by 3 days COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO

  Use the `entityType()` operator when you need to have event level granularity in your query and when you are unfamiliar with what custom events are present in your account.
</Callout>

Often times we'll use a query that selects multiple events. This one of the primary means we have to determine how much data a given agent or integration is sending us.

The following query tells us how much data the Kubernetes integration is sending us:

```sql
FROM
K8sApiServerSample,
K8sClusterSample,
K8sContainerSample,
K8sControllerManagerSample,
K8sDaemonsetSample,
K8sDeploymentSample,
K8sEndpointSample,
K8sNamespaceSample,
K8sNodeSample,
K8sPodSample,
K8sReplicasetSample,
K8sSchedulerSample,
K8sServiceSample,
K8sStatefulsetSample,
K8sVolumeSample
SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 AS 'Gigabytes'
SINCE 1 DAYS AGO
LIMIT MAX
```

It's powerful in itself, but it'll only return a single aggregate value:

```shell
42.341 Gigabytes
```

When we need to drill deeper to know how much data specific event is consuming, we can use `entityType()` in a facet clause to get that result.

Adding the clause `FACET entityType()` to the previous query gives us:

    src={entitytypeexample}
    alt="Listing of ingest by K8s event type"

      >
<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="When to use"
>
  Use `SHOW EVENT TYPES` when you're uncertain of the events that exist in your account.
</Callout>

`SHOW EVENT TYPES` lists all event types in an account for a given time period. For more detail, see [SHOW EVENT TYPES](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#show-event-types). Using a specific time window can be useful to better understand when a given event started to come into the system.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="facet-metric-name"
        title="FACET metricName"
      >
<Callout
  variant="IMPORTANT"
  title="When to use"
>
  Use `FACET metricName` when you need metric-name-level granularity in your query.
</Callout>

The best way to really explore metrics and get a sense of the relative volume of data coming from each is to use `FACET metricName` on a `SELECT FROM Metric` query. It's possible to incorporate WHERE clauses to narrow the list down. For example, to view the relative ingest volume for metrics with the text `kube_pod` in `metricName` run a query like this:

```sql
SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'Gigabytes' from Metric facet metricName where metricName like '%kube_pod%' since 1 day ago limit max
```

We'll describe these steps in more detail below. 

### Install the data ingest governance baseline dashboard [#install-dashboard]

To install the dashboard: 
1. Navigate to the [data ingest governance quickstart](https://onenr.io/0PoR8zpDYQG).
2. Click `Install this quickstart` in the upper right portion of your browser window.
3. If applicable: select your primary or top-level account in the account dropdown.
4. Click `Done`.
5. When the quickstart is done installing, open the `Data ingest governance baseline` dashboard.

That will bring you to the newly installed dashboard.

#### Dashboard overview [#dashboard-overview]

The main overview tab shows a variety of charts including some powerful time series views.

        <img
            src={orgwidebaselineview}
            alt="Organization wide baseline ingest time series"
            title="Organization-wide baseline ingest time series"
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>

The second tab provides a baseline report by sub-account and usage metric.

        <img
            src={orgwidetabularview}
            alt="Organization wide baseline tabular view"
            title="Organization wide baseline tabular view"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Organization wide baseline tabular view
        </figcaption>

The remaining tabs provide detailed views of specific telemetry types such as browser data, APM data, logs, and traces. For example, this screenshot shows the browser detail page:

        <img
            src={baselinebrowserdetail}
            alt="Baseline Browser ingest"
            title="Baseline Browser ingest"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Example of an ingest detail focused on a single telemetry type (in this case browser data).
        </figcaption>

Detail tabs include:

* APM: `ApmEventsBytes`
* Tracing: `TracingBytes`
* Browser: `BrowserEventsBytes`
* Mobile: `MobileEventsBytes`
* Infra (host): `InfraHostBytes`
* Infra (process):`InfraProcessBytes`
* Infra (integration): `InfraIntegrationBytes`
* Custom events: `CustomEventsBytes`
* Serverless: `ServerlessBytes`
* Pixie: `PixieBytes`

### Add ingest target indicators to your dashboard [#add-target-indicators]

In the prerequisites section we discussed the concept of a monthly usage target. You may actually have several targets to help keep you on track:
* An overall organizational target on daily rate or monthly ingest.
* Targets per data type to ensure the optimal breakdown (for example 1 TB per day for logs and 2 TB per day for metrics).
* Targets for specific sub-accounts or business units.

In our example we have an organization that targets their total organizational ingest to `<` 360 TB per month. This was a new target after having reduced ingest down from over 20TB per day (600 TB per month).

To make the target easier to measure against we added a threshold line chart by adding the static number `360000` to our `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT 360000, rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 30 day) AS '30 Day Rate' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' since 30 days ago limit max compare with 1 month ago TIMESERIES 7 days
```

        <img
            src={thirydayratetargetline}
            alt="Thirty day ingest target line"
            title="Thirty-day ingest target line"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use NRQL to render a line representing our target thirty-day ingest **target**.
        </figcaption>

We can also apply a daily rate target line. Let's just divide 360000 by 30 and we'll use 12000 as our daily rate target. Update the `Daily ingest rate (compare with 3 months prior)` chart:

```sql
SELECT 12000, rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS avgGbIngestTimeseries FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' TIMESERIES AUTO since 9 months ago limit max COMPARE WITH 3 months ago
```

        <img
            src={dailyratetargetline}
            alt="Daily ingest target line"
            title="Daily ingest target line"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use NRQL to render a line representing our daily ingest **target**.
        </figcaption>

### Generate a tabular 30-day ingest report [#generate-report]

To create a 30-day ingest report: 
1. Open the previously installed data ingest governance baseline dashboard.
2. Click on the **Baseline report** tab.
3. Click on `...` in the upper right of the "Last 30 days" table and choose `Export as CSV`
4. Import the CSV into Google Sheets, or the spreadsheet of your choice.

Alternatively, if you didn't install the dashboard, you may simply use this query to create a custom chart in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder):

```sql
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) AS 'gb_ingest_30_day_sum', rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS 'gb_ingest_daily_rate', derivative(GigabytesIngested, 90 day) as 'gb_ingest_90_day_derivative' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' since 30 days ago facet consumingAccountName, usageMetric  limit max
```

Below is an example of a sheet we imported into Google Sheets.

        <img
            src={baselinetabularspreadsheet}
            alt="Baseline tabular spreadsheet"
            title="Screenshot of a baseline report example"
        />
        <figcaption>
            A spreadsheet exported from the baseline dashboard tabular page
        </figcaption>

The screenshot shows the table sorted by 30 day ingest total.

Feel free to adjust your timeline and some of the details as needed. For example, we chose to extract a 90-day derivative to have some sense of change over the past few months. You could easily alter the time period of the derivative to suit your objectives.

### Customize your report [#customize-report]

Add useful columns to your report in order to facilitate other phases of data ingest governance, such as **Optimize**, and **Forecast**. The following fields will help guide optimization and planning decisions:
* Notes: Note any growth anomalies and any relevant explanations for them. Indicate any major expected growth if foreseen.
* Technical contact: Name of the manager of a given account or someone related to a specific telemetry type.

### Detect ingest anomalies [#detect-anomalies]

Here are some steps for detecting ingest anomalies. 

#### Alert on ingest anomalies [#on-ingest-anomalies]

Use [this ingest alerts guide](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts) to make sure that an increase in data consumption doesn't catch you by surprise.
At a minimum, create:
* A threshold alert to notify if you exceed monthly targets for data ingest beyond seasonal increases
* A baseline alert to notify you of a sudden sharp increase ingest data

In addition to using alerts to identify consumption anomalies, you can use New Relic Lookout to explore potential ingest anomalies.

#### Lookout view [#lookout]

Lookout allows you to provide nearly any NRQL query and it will search for anomalies over a given period of time. The view below is based on this query:

```sql
SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS avgGbIngest FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' FACET usageMetric 
```

        <img
            src={lookoutviewusagemetric}
            alt="Lookout view usage metric"
            title="Lookout view usage metric"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use Lookout to find anomalies in our ingest by **usageMetric**.
        </figcaption>

Change the facet field to `consumingAcountName` to get this view:

        <img
            src={lookoutviewconsumingaccont}
            alt="Lookout view consuming account"
            title="Lookout view consuming account"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use Lookout to find anomalies in our ingest by **consumingAccountName**.
        </figcaption>

### Install the entity breakdown dashboard (optional) [#install-entity-breakdown-dashboard]

In a previous section you installed the ingest `baseline` dashboard that uses `NrConsumption` as its primary source. In addition to that high level view you can create other visualizations that use `bytescountestimate()` to estimate ingest for nearly any event or metric. A detailed overview of `bytescountestimate()` was discussed [in the prerequisites section](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#baseline-query-examples).

To install the entity breakdown dashboard: 
1. Go to the [same quickstart](https://onenr.io/0PoR8zpDYQG) you used for the baseline dashboard.
2. Click `Install this quickstart` in the upper right section of your browser window.
3. You should install it into any account that contains APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, or Kubernetes clusters using the [import dashboard function](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import). (If you have a partnership: don't install this dashboard into a partnership owner account, or POA.) You can install this dashboard into multiple accounts. If you have a parent/child account structure: you can install the dashboard into a parent account and modify the dashboard so you have account-specific charts all in one dashboard.
4. Click `Done`.
5. When the quickstart is done installing, open the `Data governance entity breakdowns` dashboard.

    <img
        src={entitybreakdowndash}
        alt="Entity breakdown dashboard"
        title="Entity breakdown dashboard"
    />
    <figcaption>
        The entity breakdown dashboard uses **bytecountestimate()** to facet ingest by useful attributes such as application or cluster name
    </figcaption>

You can refer back to [this section](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#understand-nr-consumption-metrics) to see exactly which event types are used in these breakdowns.

<Callout variant="tip">
  These queries consume more resources because they don't work from a pre-aggregated data source like `NrConsumption`. You may need to adjust the time frames by using additional `WHERE` and `LIMIT` clauses to make them work better in some of your environments.
</Callout>

### Install the cloud integration dashboard (optional) [#install-cloud-integration-dashboard]

New Relic's cloud integrations can often be a significant source of data ingest growth. Without good visualizations it can be very difficult to pinpoint where the growth is coming from. This is partly because these integrations are so easy to configure and they aren't part of an organization's normal CI/CD pipeline. They may also not be part of a formal configuration management system.

Fortunately this powerful set of dashboards can be installed [directly from New Relic Instant Observability](https://onenr.io/0EPwJJO9Ow7).

Individual dashboards installed by this package include:
* AWS integrations
* Azure integrations
* Google Cloud Platform integrations
* On-host integrations
* Kubernetes

<figcaption>
    This [quickstart](https://onenr.io/0EPwJJO9Ow7) contains a highly granular set of dashboards breaking down data by nearly every cloud integration, on-host integration, and the Kubernetes integration.

## Exercise [#exercise]

Answering the following questions will help you develop confidence in your ability to interpret baseline data and make correct inferences. These questions can be answered using the [data ingest baseline](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#install-dashboard) and [data ingest entity breakdown](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#install-entity-breakdown-dashboard) dashboards. Install those dashboards as described and see how many of these questions you can answer.
