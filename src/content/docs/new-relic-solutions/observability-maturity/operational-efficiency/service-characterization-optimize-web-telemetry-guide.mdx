Make sure you have the web telemetry you need to detect and resolve poor user experience. This guide will help you do that by showing you how to check that you're getting the right data and that Browser is configured for you to make the most of it. 

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* Your web application is instrumented with New Relic Browser
* Your web application is configured for Pro + SPA

In this guide, you will check and tune the following:     
* [Browser application naming and sub-account placement](#browser-app-naming) 
* [JS errors](#js-errors) 
* [Page views](#page-views)
* [AJAX](#ajax-grouping)
* [Distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing) 
* [Deployments](#deployments)
* [Custom attributes](#custom)


## Tune Browser application naming and sub-account placement [#browser-app-naming] 
How's your naming and data organization?   

1. Web application instrumentation from different environments (dev/qa/production) should report into different Browser applications.  
2. Developers, operations, and product owners can work out the following using sub-account names and Browser application names:
* Which environment a Browser application supports (Such as Dev, QA, and production environments).
* The purpose of a Browser application (customer facing, internal facing, website, website component, region or regions, etc).

Need to make a change? 
1. If you have data from multiple environments reporting into one Browser application, you can [create new Browser apps](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/) and update the JavaScript snippet in your pages to report the right app. 
2. You can change the name of your browser application following the [renaming guide](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/rename-browser-apps/)

## Tune JS errors [#js-errors] 
JavaScript errors negatively impact user experience and SEO by disrupting the page load process, displaying errors, and preventing the user from completing an action. Make sure you have the data you need to track and resolve JavaScript errors. 

1. Make sure JavaScript errors are being captured.  

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-error-ui"
    title="Via the UI"
  >

  Open your web application in Browser. Open the Errors view under the left hand menu and verify that you can see JavaScript errors. If your application doesn't get a lot of traffic you may need to go back 24 hours or longer to see errors.
  <img src={omaOeScBrowserErrors} alt="Browser JavaScript Errors" title="Browser JavaScript Errors" />
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="js-error-nrql"
    title="Via NRQL"
  >
  Run the following query: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = 'MyApp' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO 
```
  A 0 count means that no JavaScript errors have been captured. 

  You can check all your web applications in a sub account by running the following: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError FACET appName LIMIT MAX SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```
  Web applications not present in the results have not reported JavaScript errors.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


You can resolve missing JavaScript errors by:
* Making sure your Browser agent is up to date. Newer Browser versions may capture JavaScript errors previously overlooked for one reason or another. 
* Making sure the Browser agent is places in the `<HEAD/>` tag of your pages. You can use Chrome developer tools to verify this. 
* Following [these instructions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/angularjs-errors-do-not-appear/) for missing AngularJS errors.
* Checking to see if your site uses an error handler that’s handling errors before the Browser agent gets the chance to see them.
* Reviewing [what's supported](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/#js-unavailable-errors) for JavaScript errors. 
* Using the [noticeError API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/noticeerror/) to capture missing errors.


2. Check that your JavaScript errors have event logs. The event log shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a JS error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-errorlog-ui"
    title="Via the UI"
  >
  To check you are capturing event logs, go to the JS Errors tab. Drill down into several different errors to verify event logs appear. 
  <img src={omaOeScBrowserErrorLog} alt="Browser JavaScript Error Logs" title="Browser JavaScript Error Logs" /> 

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Follow [these instructions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/#troubleshoot-event-log) to troubleshoot missing event logs. 

3. Make sure your JavaScript errors have stack traces.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-ui"
    title="Via the UI"
  >
  Drill down into several errors via the JS Errors tab. Stack traces will appear under the error event log. 

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-nrql"
    title="Via NRQL"
  >
  Run the following query: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND stackTrace IS NOT NULL AND stackTrace NOT LIKE '' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO 
```
  A 0 count means that no JavaScript errors have been captured. 

  You can check all your web applications in a sub account by running the following: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE stackTrace IS NOT NULL AND stackTrace NOT LIKE '' FACET appName LIMIT MAX SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```
Web applications not present in the results do not have JavaScript errors with stack traces. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Follow [these instructions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/#stack-trace) to troubleshoot missing stack traces. Or, follow [these instructions](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/upload-source-maps-api/) if you can see stack tracks but can't un-minify them. 

## Check Page view grouping [#page-views]

Page URLs in the Page views UI are automatically grouped to help you manage page performance better. The algorithm that determines the automatic grouping runs when your web app is instrumented for the first time. If your web traffic today is much different from when the app was first instrumented, you may be seeing too few groups. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-ui"
    title="Via the UI"
  >
  Check the Page views UI for your app by selecting it from the left hand menu. If what you see looks a lot the screen shot below, make a note and follow the instructions in this guide on how to address it. 
 <img src={omaOeScBrowserGroupedPageViews} alt="Browser Page URL Grouping" title="Browser Page URL Grouping" />  

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-nrql"
    title="Via NRQL"
  >
  Run the following query: 
```
SELECT count(*) from PageView WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND browserTransactionName LIKE '*.*.*%/%' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/*/%' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/*' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/%' FACET pageUrl limit 100 SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```
  The results show you which page URLs may be over grouped for your app. 

  You can check all your web applications in a sub account by running the following: 
```
SELECT count(*) from PageView WHERE browserTransactionName LIKE '*.*.*%/%' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/*/%' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/*' or browserTransactionName LIKE '%.%.%/*/*/%' FACET browserTransactionName, pageUrl limit 100 SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```
  The results will give you the same data for multiple apps. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Use [Segment allow lists](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/) to tune how your page view URLs are being grouped. 

## Check AJAX call grouping [#ajax-grouping]
AJAX calls are grouped to make it is easier to navigate them at scale. Sometimes there are so many AJAX calls that navigating them by individual request URL is too cumbersome. Follow these steps to check whether or not you need to adjust AJAX grouping. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-ui"
    title="Via the UI"
  >
  Check AJAX grouping for your app by selecting it from the left hand menu and grouping by _groupedRequestUrl_. If what you see looks a lot the screen shot below, make a note and follow the instructions in this guide on how to address it. 
 <img src={omaOeScBrowserGroupedAjaxRequests} alt="AJAX Grouping" title="AJAX Grouping" />  

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="js-stack-trace-nrql"
    title="Via NRQL"
  >
  Run the following query: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = _your app name_ AND stackTrace IS NOT NULL AND stackTrace NOT LIKE '' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO 
```
  A 0 count means that no JavaScript errors have been captured. 

  You can check all your web applications in a sub account by running the following: 
```
SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE stackTrace IS NOT NULL AND stackTrace NOT LIKE '' FACET appName LIMIT MAX SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```
Web applications not present in the results do not have JavaScript errors with stack traces. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Use [Segment allow lists](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/) to tune how your AJAX Requests are being grouped. 

## Enable distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing]
[Distributed tracing in Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing/) helps you improve AJAX performance by tracing requests to the backend all the way to the final endpoint. Tracing information is useful for understanding which applications are impacting user experience. You can use this information to address services issues yourself or delegate to the team responsible. 


## Set up deployments [#deployments]
Use NerdGraph to [track changes in your web application](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-graphql/) so you can see the impact of change against performance KPIs, conversions, and user engagement.

## Add Custom attributes [#custom]
Use [custom attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-custom-event-data/#ways) to filter and group data. Custom attributes are optional but provide a lot of value. Below are the most commonly recommended attributes. Many customers add more. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="user-attribute"
    title="user"
  >
  Recommended for all sites that have identifiable users. Follow the convention described in the [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/error-users-impacted/#attributes) documentation to be able to identify the number of users impacted by errors and know which ones.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="customer-attribute"
    title="customer"
  >
  Measure the experience of a specific customer to meet SLAs or dig into support requests.

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Additional custom attributes for retailers
<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="cart-value"
    title="cart value"
  >
 Track conversion revenue real time. Measure the impact of cart abandonment or issues during checkout.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="item-count"
    title="item count"
  >
 Track items purchased real time. Measure the impact of cart abandonment or issues during checkout.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="promo-id"
    title="promotion"
  >
  Capture how many users come to your site as the result of an ad campaign or a promotion. Measure the impact of a promotion on conversions. 
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="store-id"
    title="store"
  >
  Capture store to gather information about click-to-collect performance. Measure the performance of in-store shopping web applications. 
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="product-id"
    title="product"
  >
  Useful if the product id is not already captured in the page URL. Use this information to know which product pages are not performing well. Know which product pages receive the most traffic and which receive the least.  
  </Collapser>
