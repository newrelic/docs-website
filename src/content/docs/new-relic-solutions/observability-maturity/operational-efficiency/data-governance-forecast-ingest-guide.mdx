**Data ingest governance** is the practice of getting optimal value for the telemetry data collected by an organization. This is especially important for a complex organization that has numerous business units and working groups. 

**This is a placeholder for the fourth part of a four-part guide to optimizing your New Relic data ingest. This will be coming soon.**

In this stage you will:
* Use your baseline data to understand growth trends.
* Identify and prioritize observability objectives.
* Coordinate stakeholders in your organization to develop consensus ingest targets.
* Publish forecast and work with NR account team to steer toward the targets.

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]

Use the analysis produced in the baselining stage along with the observability value goals from the optimizing stage to produce future looking estimates for ingest for the coming months, and even years.
