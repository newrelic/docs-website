# Overview

Engineering Excellence is a business value package designed to empower engineering teams with unparalleled visibility, optimized workflows, enhanced security, and streamlined collaboration, all aimed at fostering faster innovation. By focusing on efficient resource usage and robust security practices, this package helps organizations monitor CPU and memory usage, integrate change tracking, and detect vulnerabilities. These efforts collectively enhance infrastructure efficiency, operational effectiveness, and system security. This document outlines a maturity progression model that leverages observability practices to drive engineering excellence.

# Maturity Progression Model

The maturity progression model guides organizations through a structured journey from basic resource monitoring to advanced security practices. Each level is characterized by specific practices and metrics that help measure and improve engineering excellence.

## Level 1: Reactive approach

At the reactive level, organizations use observed systems performance information as the impetus for optimizing CPU and memory usage to ensure efficient infrastructure operations. The following rules are used to evaluate the opportunity to improve outcomes through reactive engagement with:

- ***[CPU Utilization](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/engineering-excellence/l1-cpu-utilization):*** Ensures infrastructure entities are making efficient use of compute resources based on a well defined expectation of CPU usage attainment. Entities failing to stay above the expected compute attainment objective are scored as a failure. 

- ***[Memory Utilization](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/engineering-excellence/l1-memory-utilization):*** Ensures infrastructure entities are making efficient use of compute resources based on a well defined expectation of memory usage attainment. Entities failing to stay above the expected compute attainment objective are scored as a failure. 


## Level 2: Proactive approach

At the proactive level, organizations integrate software deployment lifecycle events into their observability program to anticipate the negative effects of change and ensure there is an evidence based approach to timely detection and remediation. To this end we evaluate the following rule:

- *** [Change Tracking](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/engineering-excellence/l2-change-tracking):*** Assesses whether APM entities are emitting changes events as part of the ongoing software release process at your organization. Better integration with release management practices help maintain effective oversight and improve service delivery.

## Level 3: Mastery

At the mastery level, organizations achieve direct business benefits from their observability practices, transcending mere incident remediation. The focus is on risk deferral by improved vulnerability management practices:

- ***[Service Vulnerabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/engineering-excellence/l3-service-vulnerabilities):*** Assesses the percentage of APM entities with detected vulnerabilities using SecurityRX. To strengthen security, distribute and review the detailed vulnerability lists to your architecture with security and application development teams. These steps help identify and address potential risks, ensuring your systems remain secure.

## Observability Practices

Observability practices are the actionable components of the maturity model, enabling organizations to realize the potential value of the New Relic platform. These practices include:

consistently improving your observability practices.

- ***[Development quality](/docs/tutorial-innovation-and-growth/development-quality-mgmt/): improve the quality of your code base.
- ***[Release quality](/docs/tutorial-innovation-and-growth/release-quality-mgmt/): improve the quality of your releases.
- ***[Error tracking optimization](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/error-optimization/): improve your error rates, error detection, and overall customer experience.

The New Relic Observability platform provides a structured approach to achieving engineering excellence through a maturity progression model. By advancing from resource utilization to change tracking and service vulnerabilities, organizations can achieve significant improvements in infrastructure efficiency, operational effectiveness, and system security. Observability practices play a crucial role in this journey, ensuring that organizations focus on the right metrics and actions to empower engineering teams.




## Next Steps

Organizations are encouraged to explore New Relic's resources and guides to tailor their observability journey according to their specific needs. By leveraging the maturity progression model and observability practices, businesses can unlock the full potential of the New Relic platform and achieve their engineering excellence goals.
