# Overview

This rule checks the 95th percentile of memory usage for infrastructure entities to ensure they are used efficiently according to best practices. Use this rule to identify hosts with memory usage below 80%, which may suggest opportunities to reduce memory capacity or redesign services for improved resource utilization. Setting efficiency standards and adjusting memory thresholds can enhance infrastructure efficiency.

# Description

The rule evaluates the 95th percentile of memory usage for a given infrastructure entity. It passes if the value is greater than 80% memory utilization.

# Interpretation

This rule helps determine if infrastructure hosts are being utilized efficiently according to New Relic and cloud computing best practices for memory consumption. Hosts with less than 80% utilization may be candidates for reducing memory capacity or redesigning services to better leverage available resources.  Integrating New Relic Cloud Cost Intelligence and infrastructure metrics into your financial operations further supports cost-effective resource management.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Establish Compute Efficiency Standards:*** Interview your team to determine if compute efficiency standards have been established for your infrastructure and services. Document these standards accordingly.
- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Ensure the rule is capturing the correct cohort of infrastructure resources. Verify that the entities being evaluated are representative of your operational goals.
- ***Adjust Memory Consumption Targets:*** Determine if more aggressive memory consumption targets are desired. Adjust the rule to reflect these targets and optimize infrastructure efficiency.
- ***Group Infrastructure Resources:*** Use workloads to group infrastructure resources into “team” or “division” based cohorts to better isolate organizational ownership. Consider reproducing the rule to target these specific cohorts.
- ***Explore Cloud Cost Intelligence:*** Introduce your team to [New Relic Cloud Cost Intelligence](/docs/cci/financial-intelligence/cloud-cost-insights) to gain insights into cost optimization opportunities.
- ***Integrate Infrastructure Metrics with FinOps Practices:*** Discuss the potential of integrating New Relic Infrastructure metrics into your financial operations (FinOps) practices to enhance cost management and resource efficiency.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your resource utilization strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Resource utilization strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can enhance your infrastructure memory utilization and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and efficiency goals
