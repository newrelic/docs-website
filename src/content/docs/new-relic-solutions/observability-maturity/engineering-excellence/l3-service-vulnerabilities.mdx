# Overview

This rule checks the percentage of APM entities with detected vulnerabilities to maintain the security of your services. If SecurityRX identifies vulnerabilities in libraries used by your APM services, focus on addressing these risks. Use SecurityRX to provide detailed vulnerability lists to your architecture and security teams and regularly monitor mitigation progress to strengthen your security and protect your systems from threats.

# Description

The rule evaluates the percentage of APM entities with a detected vulnerability.

# Interpretation

SecurityRX has indicated there is a potential vulnerability in a dependent library for a given APM service. Customers should prioritize verifying their exposure to the vulnerability and subsequently eliminating or acknowledging these potential risk surfaces to safeguard their services.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Overview of SecurityRX Capabilities:*** Provide an introduction to and overview of SecurityRX capabilities to your teams to understand how vulnerabilities are detected and reported.

- ***Distribute Vulnerability Lists:*** Provide a detailed list of potential vulnerabilities to your architecture and security teams for assessment and action.

- ***Monitor Mitigation Progress:*** Periodically check in to determine if vulnerabilities are being mitigated effectively and assess the progress of remediation efforts.

# Important Considerations

- ***Custom Evaluation:*** Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your vulnerability management strategy to align with your security objectives and operational goals.
- ***Continuous Improvement:*** Security strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and adapts to new threats.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can enhance your vulnerability detection and management processes, ensuring they align with your broader security objectives and protect your systems from potential threats.
