# Overview

This rule checks for change tracking events across all APM entities in your account to integrate software deployment lifecycle events into your observability program. Use this rule to identify entities missing change events, emphasizing the need for systematic change oversight to improve service delivery and reduce incidents. By collecting telemetry on systems with active deployments and refining change methods, you can enhance operational efficiency. Engage stakeholders in change management practices that utilize New Relic's capabilities for better oversight and response to change-driven incidents.

# Description

The rule evaluates the presence of change tracking events on the complete cohort of APM entities within an account.

# Interpretation

A lack of recorded change tracking events for the given cohort of entities may indicate that the software deployment lifecycle is not fully integrated into the observability program. Change events are crucial for assessing whether service delivery is improving over time, as changes often lead to significant incidents. A well-executed process for systematically overseeing changes and remediating faulty changes can enhance operational efficiency.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Evaluate Telemetry Collection:*** Ensure your account is collecting telemetry on systems with active build, release, or canary deployment patterns.

- ***Isolate Change Introduction Methods:*** Identify the approach used to introduce changes into the environment and ensure New Relic change events are injected effectively.

- ***Review Change Validation Process:*** Determine if there is an active process for reviewing and validating the effectiveness of introduced changes.

- ***Engage Change Management Stakeholders:*** Identify stakeholders involved in change management and demonstrate New Relic change views and telemetry review options to them.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your change tracking strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Change management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can enhance your change tracking processes and ensure they align with your broader business objectives and operational efficiency goals.
