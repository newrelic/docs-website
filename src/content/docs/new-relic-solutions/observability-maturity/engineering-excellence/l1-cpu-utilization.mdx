# Overview

This rule provides a score based on the CPU usage efficiency of your infrastructure entities. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to optimize resource utilization.

# Description

The score evaluates the 95th percentile of CPU usage for a given infrastructure entity. The rule passes if the value is greater than 80% CPU utilization.

# Interpretation

This rule helps determine if infrastructure hosts are being utilized efficiently according to New Relic and cloud computing best practice efficiency benchmarks. Hosts with less than 80% utilization may be candidates for reducing compute capacity or redesigning services to better leverage available resources.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Establish Compute Efficiency Standards:*** Interview your team to determine if compute efficiency standards have been established for your infrastructure and services. Document these standards accordingly.
- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Ensure the rule is capturing the correct cohort of infrastructure resources. Verify that the entities being evaluated are representative of your operational goals.
- ***Adjust CPU Consumption Targets:*** Determine if more aggressive CPU consumption targets are desired. Adjust the rule to reflect these targets and optimize infrastructure efficiency.
- ***Group Infrastructure Resources:*** Use workloads to group infrastructure resources into “team” or “division” based cohorts to better isolate organizational ownership. Consider reproducing the rule to target these specific cohorts.
- ***Explore Cloud Cost Intelligence:*** Introduce your team to New Relic Cloud Cost Intelligence to gain insights into cost optimization opportunities.
- ***Integrate Infrastructure Metrics with FinOps Practices:*** Discuss the potential of integrating New Relic Infrastructure metrics into your financial operations (FinOps) practices to enhance cost management and resource efficiency.

# Important Considerations

- ***Custom Evaluation:*** Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your resource utilization strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
- ***Continuous Improvement:*** Resource utilization strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your infrastructure CPU utilization and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and efficiency goals.
