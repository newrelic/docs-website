#  Overview

This rule checks the percentage of APM services reporting errors to identify issues affecting user experience or business process stability. Use this rule to highlight services with these errors and address them to prevent user dissatisfaction. Ensure errors reflect real user-impacting conditions, prioritize error rates for critical services, and track defects in systems like JIRA. Document remediation activities to manage and reduce errors, enhancing the reliability of your web applications. Integrating Change Tracking can help pinpoint software and system changes that reduce error rates.

# Description

The rule evaluates the percentage of APM services that report 5xx errors as HTTP request responses.

# Interpretation

5xx series HTTP errors can indicate significant problems within a web application. Whether isolated or recurring, the potential causes of these error conditions should be evaluated and remediated whenever possible to maintain user satisfaction and application reliability.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Validate Error Conditions:*** Determine whether the service errors included are representative of true user-affecting errors (i.e., not redirects or false positives). Adjust the query to reflect actionable user-impacting error conditions.

- ***Prioritize Critical Service Errors:*** Focus on service error rates for the most critical and complex services. Identify areas of potential end-user dissatisfaction due to these errors.

- ***Track Defect Resolution:*** Identify if there is a defect tracking ticket (e.g., JIRA) for the reported error. Implement a tracking method to ensure it is in the engineering backlog and being actively addressed.

- ***Document and Report Remediation Activities:*** Record errors that have been detected and report on remediation activities. Consider integrating Change Tracking to isolate software and system changes that decrease error rates.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your error management strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Error management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and improves user experience.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can enhance your APM service error detection and management processes, ensuring they align with your broader business objectives and provide a reliable user experience.
