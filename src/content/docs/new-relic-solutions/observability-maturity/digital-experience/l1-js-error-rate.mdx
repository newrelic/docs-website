# Overview

This rule checks the percentage of Browser entities with JavaScript errors to ensure a positive frontend user experience. Use this rule to identify entities with unresolved errors, highlighting the importance of addressing them promptly. By reviewing Error Inbox details and preparing lists of unresolved errors for triage, you can target Browser applications with significant user exposure. Regularly assess error remediation progress to enhance reliability and quality, ensuring error conditions are prioritized in the release management process.

# Description

The rule evaluates the percentage of Browser entities that exhibit JavaScript errors.

# Interpretation

Errors within the frontend/browser user experience can lead to negative user perceptions. Efforts should be made to address entities with unresolved JavaScript errors to improve user satisfaction and application reliability.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Error Inbox Details:*** Examine Error Inbox details for JavaScript errors and prepare a list of unknown or unresolved errors for your architecture and operations teams to collaboratively triage.

- ***Target High-Exposure Browser Applications:*** Consider augmenting the rule to focus on Browser applications with the most end-user experience exposure, particularly in cases of false positives.

- ***Assess Prioritization in Release Management:*** A lower score may indicate a lack of prioritization of error conditions in the release management process. Ensure errors are addressed appropriately during releases.

- ***Periodic Error Evaluation:*** Regularly review error evaluation to determine if progress is being made in remediating issues or disregarding false positives.

# Important Considerations

- ***Custom Evaluation:*** Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your error management strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
- ***Continuous Improvement:*** Error management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and improves user experience.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can enhance your Browser application error detection and management processes, ensuring they align with your broader business objectives and provide a positive user experience.
