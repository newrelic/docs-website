# Overview

This rule checks if the 75th percentile of an entity's Interaction to Next Paint (INP) exceeds 5 seconds, which is crucial for assessing user interface responsiveness and web performance. INP measures how quickly a website responds to user actions like clicks or key presses, affecting user experience. Use this rule to identify Browser entities with slow INP, analyze the impact on users, and escalate issues to engineering teams for improvement. Regularly evaluate these metrics as part of your observability program to continuously enhance user interaction quality.

# Description

The rule evaluates whether the 75th percentile attainment for an entity's pageview timing of Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is greater than 5 seconds.

# Interpretation

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a web performance metric that measures user interface responsivenessâ€”specifically, how quickly a website responds to user interactions such as clicks or key presses. Slow INP times can negatively affect user experience and satisfaction.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Problematic INP Instances:*** Identify Browser entities that are demonstrating a problematic INP and assess the severity of the issue.

- ***Assess User Impact:*** Determine the number of users or unique sessions encountering the INP issue to understand its impact on user experience.

- ***Escalate to Engineering:*** Facilitate escalation to engineering resources for review as a Browser application defect, ensuring timely resolution.

- ***Evaluate Improvement Opportunities:*** Assess whether improvements can be made to the INP flow to enhance responsiveness and user interaction quality.

- ***Recurring Evaluation:*** Implement a recurring evaluation of these web vital measures as part of ongoing observability program execution to maintain optimal performance.

# Important Considerations

- ***Custom Evaluation:*** Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your INP performance strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
- ***Continuous Improvement:*** Web performance strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and enhances user experience.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can improve your Browser application's INP performance, ensuring it aligns with your broader business objectives and provides a responsive user experience.
