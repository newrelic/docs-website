# Overview

This rule checks if the 75th percentile of an entity's Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) exceeds 5 seconds, which is crucial for understanding and improving page stability and user experience. CLS measures the largest burst of layout shifts during a page's lifecycle, affecting visual stability. Use this rule to identify Browser entities with high CLS, assess the impact on users, and escalate issues to engineering teams for improvement. Regularly evaluate these metrics as part of your observability program to continuously enhance layout stability and user satisfaction.

# Description

The rule evaluates whether the 75th percentile attainment for an entity's pageview timing of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is greater than 5 seconds.

# Interpretation

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifecycle of a page. A layout shift occurs anytime a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. High CLS scores can negatively impact visual stability and user experience.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Problematic CLS Instances:*** Identify Browser entities that are demonstrating a problematic CLS and assess the severity of the issue.

- ***Assess User Impact:*** Determine the number of users or unique sessions encountering the CLS issue to understand its impact on user experience.

- ***Escalate to Engineering:*** Facilitate escalation to engineering resources for review as a Browser application defect, ensuring timely resolution.

- ***Evaluate Improvement Opportunities:*** Assess whether improvements can be made to the CLS flow to enhance visual stability and user satisfaction.

- ***Recurring Evaluation:*** Implement a recurring evaluation of these web vital measures as part of ongoing observability program execution to maintain optimal performance.

# Important Considerations

- ***Custom Evaluation:*** Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your CLS performance strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
- ***Continuous Improvement:*** Web performance strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and enhances user experience.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can improve your Browser application's CLS performance, ensuring it aligns with your broader business objectives and provides a stable user experience.
