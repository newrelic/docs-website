# Overview

This rule checks if the 75th percentile of an entity's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) exceeds 5 seconds, which is crucial for optimizing user experience and SEO performance. LCP measures the loading speed of the largest element on a webpage. Use this rule to identify Browser entities with slow LCP, assess the impact on users, and escalate issues to engineering teams for improvement. Regularly evaluate these metrics as part of your observability program to continuously enhance user experience.

# Description

The rule evaluates whether the 75th percentile attainment for an entity's pageview timing of the Largest Contentful Paint is greater than 5 seconds.

# Interpretation

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how quickly the largest element within the viewport of a webpage loads. As a Core Web Vital metric, LCP is essential for user experience and SEO. It is measured from the user's initial page load to when the largest content element is rendered.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Problematic LCP Instances:*** Identify Browser entities that are demonstrating a problematic LCP and assess the severity of the issue.

- ***Assess User Impact:*** Determine the number of users or unique sessions encountering the LCP issue to understand its impact on user experience.

- ***Escalate to Engineering:*** Facilitate escalation to engineering resources for review as a Browser application defect, ensuring timely resolution.

- ***Evaluate Improvement Opportunities:*** Assess whether improvements can be made to LCP rendering to enhance loading times and user experience.

- ***Recurring Evaluation:*** Implement a recurring evaluation of these web vital measures as part of ongoing observability program execution to maintain optimal performance.

### Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your LCP performance strategy to align with your business objectives and operational goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Web performance strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements and enhances user experience.

By understanding and applying this rule, you can improve your Browser application's LCP performance, ensuring it aligns with your broader business objectives and provides a positive user experience.
