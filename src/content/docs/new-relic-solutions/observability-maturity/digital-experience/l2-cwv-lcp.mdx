# Overview

This scorecard rule identifies when your web pages are loading too slowly, directly impacting user experience and business performance. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how quickly the main content of your page becomes visible to users - Google considers this a critical factor for both user satisfaction and search rankings.

The rule triggers when the 75th percentile of your LCP measurements exceeds 2.5 seconds, indicating that a significant portion of your users experience slow page loading. Use this rule to proactively identify performance issues, understand their impact on your user base, and drive systematic improvements to page load speed.

## Why LCP matters for your business

**User experience impact:**
- Pages with good LCP (≤2.5 seconds) keep users engaged and reduce bounce rates
- Slow loading content leads to user frustration and abandoned sessions
- Fast LCP contributes to higher conversion rates and user satisfaction

**SEO and visibility:**
- Google uses LCP as a ranking factor in search results
- Poor LCP scores can negatively impact organic search visibility
- Core Web Vitals compliance is essential for competitive search performance

**Performance measurement:**
- LCP represents real user experience, not synthetic testing
- Provides actionable insights into content delivery optimization
- Enables data-driven decisions for frontend performance improvements

# Rule definition

This scorecard rule evaluates whether the 75th percentile of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measurements for a browser entity exceeds 2.5 seconds, based on Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds.

## LCP measurement criteria

**Google's official LCP thresholds:**
- **Good:** ≤2.5 seconds
- **Needs Improvement:** 2.5-4.0 seconds  
- **Poor:** >4.0 seconds

**What LCP measures:**
LCP identifies the loading time of the largest content element visible in the viewport during the initial page load. This element is typically:
- Images (including background images)
- Video poster images
- Block-level text elements
- Inline text elements containing text nodes

**Measurement timing:**
- Starts when the user initiates page navigation
- Ends when the largest content element finishes rendering
- Updates dynamically as larger elements load
- Stops measuring when user interacts with the page

## Understanding LCP optimization

Improving LCP requires optimizing how quickly your page's main content loads and renders. Focus on these key areas:

### Resource loading optimization
- **Critical resource prioritization:** Ensure the LCP element loads early in the page lifecycle
- **Resource hints:** Use preload, preconnect, and dns-prefetch to speed up critical resources
- **Efficient resource delivery:** Optimize images, fonts, and other assets that contribute to LCP

### Server response optimization  
- **Reduce server response time:** Target Time to First Byte (TTFB) under 600ms
- **Implement caching strategies:** Use CDNs and browser caching for faster content delivery
- **Optimize database queries:** Reduce backend processing time for dynamic content

### Rendering optimization
- **Eliminate render-blocking resources:** Minimize CSS and JavaScript that delays content rendering
- **Optimize critical rendering path:** Prioritize above-the-fold content rendering
- **Reduce layout shifts:** Ensure stable rendering to maintain LCP timing accuracy

## How to improve LCP performance

If your LCP scores indicate poor loading performance, follow these optimization steps:

### 1. Identify your LCP element

1. **Use New Relic Browser monitoring** to identify which elements are causing slow LCP across different pages
2. **Analyze LCP patterns** by device type, connection speed, and geographic location
3. **Review Chrome DevTools** to see which element is identified as the LCP candidate
4. **Prioritize high-traffic pages** with the worst LCP performance for immediate attention

### 2. Optimize images and media

**Image optimization:**
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Implement responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes
- Compress images without sacrificing visual quality
- Use appropriate image dimensions to avoid unnecessary scaling

**Lazy loading strategy:**
- Avoid lazy loading above-the-fold images that might be LCP candidates
- Use native lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Implement intersection observer for custom lazy loading solutions

**Content delivery:**
- Use a CDN for faster global image delivery
- Implement image optimization services (like New Relic's partner solutions)
- Consider progressive JPEG for large images
- Optimize video poster images and thumbnails

### 3. Optimize server and network performance

**Server-side optimization:**
- Reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB) through server performance tuning
- Implement efficient caching strategies at multiple levels
- Use compression (gzip, Brotli) for text-based resources
- Optimize database queries and API response times

**Network optimization:**
- Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for improved multiplexing
- Implement resource prioritization with fetch priority hints
- Minimize redirects that delay content loading
- Use preconnect for external domains hosting critical resources

### 4. Eliminate render-blocking resources

**CSS optimization:**
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Use media queries to load non-critical CSS asynchronously
- Minimize and compress CSS files
- Remove unused CSS rules

**JavaScript optimization:**
- Defer non-critical JavaScript execution
- Use code splitting to load only necessary scripts
- Implement proper script loading strategies (async/defer)
- Minimize JavaScript execution during initial page load

### 5. Implement performance monitoring

**Real user monitoring:**
- Use New Relic Browser to track LCP performance continuously
- Set up alerts for LCP degradation
- Monitor LCP across different user segments and devices
- Track correlation between LCP and business metrics

**Performance testing:**
- Implement automated performance testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Use synthetic monitoring to catch regressions early
- Test on various devices and network conditions
- Validate optimizations with A/B testing

## Implementation guidance

### Setting up LCP monitoring

1. **Configure New Relic Browser monitoring** with Core Web Vitals collection enabled
2. **Establish baseline measurements** across your key pages and user segments
3. **Set up LCP dashboards** to track performance trends and identify problem areas
4. **Create alerts** for LCP degradation that align with your user experience goals

### Creating actionable alerts

Set up meaningful alerts for LCP performance:
- **Good threshold:** Alert when 75th percentile exceeds 2.5 seconds
- **Poor threshold:** Critical alert when 75th percentile exceeds 4.0 seconds
- **Trend monitoring:** Alert on significant week-over-week degradation
- **Segment-specific alerts:** Monitor mobile, desktop, and geographic performance separately

### Building optimization workflows

1. **Regular performance reviews:** Schedule monthly assessments of LCP data
2. **Prioritization framework:** Focus on high-traffic pages with poor LCP scores
3. **Testing protocols:** Implement A/B testing for optimization changes
4. **Cross-team collaboration:** Establish clear processes for engineering escalation and resolution

## Important considerations

**Custom evaluation:** These guidelines provide a solid foundation, but every website is unique. Consider your specific user base, content types, and business objectives when setting LCP targets. Factor in your typical user devices, network conditions, and critical user journeys.

**Holistic optimization:** LCP works best as part of a comprehensive performance strategy. Balance LCP improvements with other Core Web Vitals (CLS and INP) and ensure optimizations don't negatively impact other user experience metrics.

**Continuous monitoring:** Web performance is dynamic. User behavior, content changes, and external dependencies can impact LCP over time. Maintain ongoing monitoring and be prepared to adjust your optimization strategy as needed.
