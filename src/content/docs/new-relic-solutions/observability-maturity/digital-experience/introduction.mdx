# Overview

The Digital Experience rules aim to ensure a positive frontend user experience by monitoring key metrics such as JavaScript errors, HTTP 5xx errors, and Core Web Vitals like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). These rules help identify and address issues that can negatively impact user satisfaction and application reliability. By regularly reviewing error conditions and performance metrics, organizations can prioritize improvements in their release management process and enhance overall service delivery. The reactive and proactive approach to digital experience metrics and events informs a broader service level management goal, to better plan for and deliver digital experiences. 

# Maturity progression model

The maturity progression model is designed to guide organizations through a structured journey from reactive to proactive and ultimately mastery levels of observability. Each level is characterized by specific practices and metrics that help measure and improve digital experience.

## Level 1: Reactive approach

At the reactive level, organizations respond to incidents as they occur, often without prior warning. The focus is on establishing basic alert mechanisms to ensure that end-user experience challenges are detected promptly. The following rules are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a reactive approach:

- ***[JavaScript Error Rate](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/digital-experience/l1-js-error-rate):*** Ensures browser based JavaScript errors are evaluated and triaged to ensure maximum benefit to end user experience.

- ***[Service Error Rate](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/digital-experience/l1-service-error-rate):*** Ensures server side errors that might be user impacting, have been acknowledged and triaged to ensure maximum benefit to end user experience. 

## Level 2: Proactive approach

The proactive level involves anticipating potential issues before they impact business operations. Organizations at this stage use observability practices to continuously improve digital experience. The following rules and metrics are evaluated:

- ***[Core Web Vitals | LCP](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/digital-experience/l2-cwv-lcp):*** Evaluates web page Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) to determine if it aligns with core web vital best practice guidance. 

- ***[Core Web Vitals | CLS](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/digital-experience/l2-cwv-cls):*** Evaluates web page Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) to determine if it aligns with core web vital best practice guidance. 

- ***[Core Web Vitals | INP](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/digital-experience/l2-cwv-inp):*** Evaluates web page Interaction to Next Paint (INP) ) to determine if it aligns with core web vital best practice guidance. 


## Level 3: Mastery

At the mastery level, organizations achieve direct business benefits from their observability practices, transcending mere incident remediation. For digital experience this requires understanding and encoding the expectations of service delivery into end-user informed service level indicators:

- ***[Service Level Attainment](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/business-uptime/l3-service-level-attainment):*** Evaluates the latest service level compliance score for each defined SLI. A success rate above 95% is considered successful, indicating high reliability and uptime.

# Observability practices

Observability practices are the actionable components of the maturity model, enabling organizations to realize the potential value of the New Relic platform. These practices include:

- ***[Quality foundation (QF)](/docs/tutorial-improve-customer-experience/intro-to-customer-experience/): measure and improve the performance of your customers' digital experience.

- ***[Bottom-of-the-funnel analysis (BotFA)](/docs/tutorial-improve-customer-experience/bottom-funnel-analysis/): improve your conversions by focusing on the end of user journey performance.

- ***[Service level management (SLM)](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/slm-implementation-guide/)***: Standardizes data into a universal language, improving communication between IT and business stakeholders. SLM enhances reliability by reducing business-impacting incidents and their duration.


## Next Steps

Organizations are encouraged to explore New Relic's resources and guides to tailor their observability journey according to their specific needs. By leveraging the maturity progression model and observability practices, businesses can unlock the full potential of the New Relic platform and achieve their digital experience.
