# Overview

The Service Level Attainment rule has produced a score based on the attainment of service level objectives (SLOs) for each defined service level indicator (SLI). This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to optimize your service delivery program.

# Description

The score evaluates the latest service level compliance score for each defined SLI. The default success rate is set at 95%, with compliance above this level considered successful.

# Interpretation

This score is limited to the SLIs that have been defined, offering a snapshot of SLI attainment at a given point in time. It reflects how the SLI program is adapting to service delivery expectations. Ideally, SLIs should drive ongoing improvement in your service delivery program. This maturity rule helps assess whether you are consistently meeting your service level expectations.

Drawing from Google's SRE practices and New Relic's Service Level Management documentation:

* SLIs and SLOs: SLIs should accurately reflect critical aspects of user experience and service performance. SLOs should be realistic, achievable, and aligned with business objectives.
* Continuous Improvement: The goal is to foster a culture of continual improvement, using SLI and SLO metrics to identify areas needing enhancement and to drive reliability and performance.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Identify Underperforming SLIs:*** Determine if any SLIs are regularly missing their attainment goals. Escalate these as potential areas of improvement in service delivery.
- ***Evaluate Rule Threshold:*** Review the success threshold to ensure it captures realistic expectations for your organization. Modify the 95% success rate if it is too high or too low for your operational context.
- ***Continuous Evaluation:*** Regularly assess the compliance of service level attainment. Aim for improvement over time, indicating a healthy and evolving service delivery program.
- ***Enhance Service Delivery Practices:*** Leverage insights from SRE practices to refine SLIs and SLOs. Focus on metrics that drive meaningful improvements in reliability and user satisfaction.
- ***Engage in SLM Workshops:*** Conduct workshops to review SLM practices and strategies. Encourage ongoing education and adaptation of service level management principles.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your SLI and SLO strategies to align with your business objectives and service delivery goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Service level management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your service level objective attainment and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
