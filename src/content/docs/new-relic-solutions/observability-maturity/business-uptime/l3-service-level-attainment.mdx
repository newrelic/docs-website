Service level attainment measures whether your services consistently meet their defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs), demonstrating operational excellence and the business value of your observability practices. This represents the pinnacle of mature observability programs.

## About this scorecard rule

This service level attainment rule is part of Level 3 (Mastery) in the [business uptime maturity model](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/business-uptime/introduction). It evaluates whether your services are meeting their reliability targets, indicating that your observability practice delivers measurable business outcomes.

**Why this matters:** Consistent SLO attainment demonstrates that your observability investments translate into reliable services that customers can depend on. This level of performance excellence drives customer satisfaction, business growth, and competitive advantage.

## How this rule works

This rule evaluates the latest service level compliance score for each defined SLI in your account. It measures whether your services are meeting their SLO targets over the defined time periods.

## Understanding your score

- **Pass (Green):** Services consistently meet their SLOs with 95% or higher compliance rates
- **Fail (Red):** One or more services fall below the 95% SLO compliance threshold
- **Target:** All critical services achieving 95%+ SLO compliance, demonstrating reliable service delivery

**What this means:**
- **Passing score:** Your services deliver consistent, reliable performance that meets user expectations and business requirements
- **Failing score:** Service reliability issues are impacting user experience and potentially affecting business outcomes

## Understanding the 95% threshold

The 95% SLO compliance threshold represents a balance between reliability and operational efficiency:

### Why 95%?
- **Industry standard:** Aligns with common industry practices for high-availability services
- **Error budget concept:** Allows for 5% failure rate, providing flexibility for maintenance, deployments, and unexpected issues
- **Business impact:** Typically represents the reliability level where customer satisfaction remains high
- **Operational sustainability:** Achievable without excessive operational overhead or costs

### When to adjust the threshold
- **Higher requirements (99%+):** Mission-critical systems, financial services, healthcare applications
- **Lower requirements (90-94%):** Internal tools, experimental features, cost-sensitive applications
- **Variable thresholds:** Different targets for different service tiers or user segments

## How to improve service level attainment

If your score shows SLO compliance issues, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Identify underperforming services

**Analyze SLO violations:**
1. **Review compliance trends:** Look at which services consistently miss SLO targets
2. **Identify patterns:** Determine if violations occur at specific times, during deployments, or under certain conditions
3. **Assess impact:** Understand which SLO misses have the greatest business or user impact
4. **Prioritize improvements:** Focus first on services with highest business criticality and largest SLO gaps

**Use data-driven analysis:**
- **Error budget burn rate:** Track how quickly services consume their allowed failure budget
- **Time-series analysis:** Identify trends in SLO performance over time
- **Correlation analysis:** Look for relationships between SLO violations and other events (deployments, traffic spikes, infrastructure changes)

### 2. Investigate root causes

**Technical factors:**
- **Infrastructure issues:** Capacity constraints, hardware failures, network problems
- **Application bugs:** Performance regressions, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms
- **Deployment problems:** Bad releases, configuration errors, rollback issues
- **Dependency failures:** Third-party service outages, database performance, API rate limits

**Operational factors:**
- **Monitoring gaps:** Insufficient observability leading to delayed problem detection
- **Incident response:** Slow resolution times due to poor processes or tooling
- **Change management:** Inadequate testing or deployment practices
- **Capacity planning:** Insufficient resources during peak usage periods

### 3. Implement targeted improvements

**Immediate actions:**
- **Fix critical issues:** Address any ongoing problems causing SLO violations
- **Optimize performance:** Tune database queries, improve caching, optimize resource usage
- **Enhance monitoring:** Add more detailed observability to identify issues faster
- **Improve incident response:** Streamline processes to reduce mean time to resolution

**Strategic improvements:**
- **Architecture enhancements:** Implement redundancy, improve scalability, reduce dependencies
- **Automation:** Deploy auto-scaling, self-healing systems, automated recovery procedures
- **Quality practices:** Enhance testing, implement canary deployments, improve code review
- **Capacity management:** Better resource planning, proactive scaling, performance testing

### 4. Optimize SLOs and SLIs

**Review SLO appropriateness:**
- **Business alignment:** Ensure SLOs reflect actual business requirements and user expectations
- **Achievability:** Verify that SLOs are realistic given current technology and resource constraints
- **Measurability:** Confirm that SLIs accurately capture the user experience being measured

**Refine SLI definitions:**
- **User focus:** Ensure SLIs measure what users actually experience, not just technical metrics
- **Actionability:** Verify that SLI violations lead to clear, actionable improvement opportunities
- **Sensitivity:** Adjust SLI thresholds to catch meaningful issues without excessive noise

## Measuring improvement

Track these metrics to verify your service level attainment improvements:

- **SLO compliance rate:** Percentage of services meeting their 95% reliability targets
- **Error budget utilization:** How efficiently services use their allowed failure budget
- **Improvement velocity:** Rate at which underperforming services achieve compliance
- **Business impact correlation:** Relationship between SLO attainment and business metrics (customer satisfaction, revenue, churn)

## Common scenarios and solutions

**Consistently missing SLOs despite effort:**
- **Problem:** Some services seem unable to reach reliability targets
- **Solution:** Reassess SLO targets for realism, investigate fundamental architecture issues, or consider accepting lower reliability for less critical services

**SLO violations during deployment windows:**
- **Problem:** Releases consistently cause SLO breaches
- **Solution:** Implement blue-green deployments, improve testing practices, use canary releases, or adjust SLOs to account for planned maintenance

**External dependency failures affecting SLOs:**
- **Problem:** Third-party services cause SLO violations outside your control
- **Solution:** Implement circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, redundant providers, or exclude external dependency failures from SLO calculations

**Seasonal or cyclical SLO violations:**
- **Problem:** Services fail SLOs during predictable peak periods
- **Solution:** Implement proactive scaling, capacity planning, or create time-based SLO targets that account for known traffic patterns

## Advanced service level management
