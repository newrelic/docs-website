# Overview

The Service Level Coverage rule has produced a score based on the Service Level Indicator (SLI) coverage within your account. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your service level management strategy.

# Description

The score evaluates the latest entity harvest to determine if entities have defined an SLI.

# Interpretation

The goal is to achieve complete SLI coverage for the most critical and complex business services within your estate. This evaluation casts a wide net across entity types and environments, and may require tuning to select a more realistic cohort of service-representing entities from which to construct SLIs.

The score achieved should be directly reflective of your site-operations, SRE, and service delivery service level management program. Remember:

* Defining SLIs: Focus on the metrics that most accurately reflect the user experience and business outcomes. SLIs should provide a clear picture of service performance and reliability.
Balancing Complexity and Criticality: Identify services that are both critical to business operations and complex in nature. Prioritize these for SLI development.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and refine your SLIs and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to align with evolving business needs and user expectations.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Ensure the rule captures the correct account, environment, team, or other attributes to isolate service-related entities that can benefit from defined SLIs.
- ***Complexity vs. Criticality Assessment:*** Conduct assessments to identify the most important services within your estate. Use tagging to better segregate these entities.
- ***Review Tagging Standards:*** Examine your tagging standards and related rules scoring in the "Observability Maturity: Intelligent Observability" scorecard to ensure your estate can be effectively segmented into functional cohorts.
- ***Conduct a focused SLM Workshop:*** Consider hosting a workshop to review Service Level Management (SLM) training materials and strategies. Advocate for ongoing education in SLM practices and develop a common understanding of service level management principles for your organization. 
- ***Create Example SLMs:*** Develop example SLMs for review for your technical, business, and program management service delivery participants. Ensure to illustrate best practices and potential applications within your business context.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your SLI strategy to align with your service level management approach.
* Continuous Improvement: Service level management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your service level management and ensure it aligns with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
