# Overview

The Alerts Mean Time to Close rule has produced a score based on the time taken to close incidents. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to optimize your incident management strategy.

# Description

The score evaluates the time taken to close each incident, with those resolved in under 30 minutes considered successful incident resolutions.

# Interpretation

Long-running incident open times, especially those related to specific alert policies and conditions, may indicate sub-optimal detection and resolution processes or volatility in the targeted entity. Consider the following:

* Entity Behavior and Alert Thresholds: Evaluate the behavior of the entity and the alert thresholds intended for it. Aim to improve the alert-to-action incident management procedure.
* Entity Importance: Some entities may not warrant rapid remediation. Consider alternative methods for being informed of unexpected telemetry values from such entities.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Determine if the cohort of incidents-to-entities needs modification to exclude entities prone to long-running incident times.
- ***Review Incident Management Practices:*** Assess whether New Relic is capturing the close event accurately. If incident management occurs outside New Relic AIOps/Alerts, the rule logic may need revision. In some cases, disabling or deleting the rule may be more realistic.
- ***Develop Alerting and Incident Management Strategy:*** Ensure you have a well-defined alerting and incident management strategy. If not, engage in an [Alert Quality Management (AQM)](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide/) workshop to introduce the need for a comprehensive, well-documented approach to alerting maintenance, incident management, and regular program review.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your incident management strategy to align with your business objectives and operational requirements.
* Continuous Improvement: Incident management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your incident resolution times and ensure they align with your broader business objectives and observability strategy.
