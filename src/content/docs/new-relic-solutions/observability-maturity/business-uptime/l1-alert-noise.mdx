# Overview

The Alert Noise rule has produced a score based on the number of incidents attributed to specific policies over a 7-day window. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to optimize your incident management strategy.

# Description

The score evaluates incidents over a 7-day period to determine if a specific policy is responsible for more than 14 incidents during that time.

# Interpretation

The goal is to maintain a manageable number of incidents that can be effectively addressed. If incidents reoccur from specific policies, the underlying source of instability should be identified and remediated. If an incident isn't suitable for remediation, consider whether it should be classified as a critical violation.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Ensure the rule is targeting the correct account and cohort of entity types. Modify the rule to address alert incidents for target entities as needed.

- ***Adjust Incident Occurrence Threshold:*** Review and adjust the number of incident occurrences to align with your expectations and systems management standards. Customers may find more frequent or less frequent incidents appropriate for their alerting strategy.

- ***Develop Long-Term Assessment:*** Assess policy violations over time, considering longer evaluation periods to identify systems indicative of persistent reliability challenges. Create a prioritized list with risk assessments for each system to determine if they could benefit from architectural or implementation improvements.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your measurements to align with your systems management standards and best practices.
* Continuous Improvement: Incident management strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your policy incident management and ensure it aligns with your broader systems management strategy.
