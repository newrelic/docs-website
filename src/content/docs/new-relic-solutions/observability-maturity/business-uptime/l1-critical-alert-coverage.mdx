# Overview

The Critical Alert Coverage rule has produced a score based on the critical alert coverage of your systems. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your alerting strategy.

# Description

The score evaluates a 7-day sample of alert incidents per target entity to determine what percentage are due to critical versus warning violations.

# Interpretation

An overreliance on critical alert conditions may indicate a lack of progressive alerting and incident response processes. This could lead to alert fatigue and hinder continual improvement in system and service reliability or quality.

It's important to balance your alerts by defining an alerting strategy that includes:

* Immediately Actionable Alerts: These are critical alerts that indicate negative business-impacting events requiring immediate attention.
* Anticipatory Alerts: These alerts signal unexpected conditions that are not immediately business-impacting but may require future adjustments.
* Retrospective Alerts: These alerts are not meant for immediate action but should be evaluated through thoughtful periodic analysis of system behavior.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Evaluate Target Cohort:*** Ensure the rule targets the correct cohort of incidents, focusing on production systems.
- ***Adjust Success Threshold:*** Review and adjust the defined success threshold. The default is 25% of alerts should be critical. If your use of New Relic is primarily for critical alert conditions or if there are other reasons for a higher proportion of critical alerts, adjust accordingly.
- ***Review Alerting Strategy:*** Conduct a broad review of your alerting strategy. Ensure there are well-established expectations for system operations and a progression of alert design that includes anticipatory and retrospective alerting conditions, in addition to those needing immediate attention.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your measurements to align with your observability goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Observability strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your critical alert coverage and ensure it aligns with your broader monitoring strategy.
