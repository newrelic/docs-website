# Overview

The Service Delivery Alert Coverage rule has produced a score based on the alert coverage of your service delivery entities. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to enhance your observability program.

# Description

The score is derived from a rule that checks for alert definitions on your APM-APPLICATION, BROWSER-APPLICATION, MOBILE-APPLICATION, or SYNTH-MONITOR entities. If any of these entities lack a defined alert, the rule will register as a failure.

# Interpretation

A low score in alert coverage may suggest that the management of service entities, such as APM and Browser applications, is not prioritized within your observability strategy.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Service Delivery Entity Coverage: Assess your service delivery entities in relation to your observability goals. These entities are typically associated with supporting or executing customer business processes. Modify the rule to include entities that align with your service delivery architecture, such as Lambda or Databricks.
- ***Adjust Rule Applicability:*** If New Relic is not central to your service delivery observability, consider disabling or removing the rule.
- ***Refine Rule Query:*** A low score might result from capturing an inappropriate cohort of entities. Modify the NRQL query to focus more accurately on production service delivery entities.
- ***Develop an Alerting Strategy:*** Optimize the rule for your needs, then review or develop an alerting strategy that includes service delivery alerting.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your measurements to align with your observability goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Observability strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your service delivery observability and ensure it aligns with your broader monitoring strategy.
