# Overview

The Infrastructure Alert Coverage rule has produced a score based on the alert coverage of your infrastructure entities. This document explains the interpretation of your score and offers guidance on actions you can take to improve your observability program.

# Description

The score is generated from a rule that checks for alert definitions on your INFRA-HOST or INFRA-KUBERNETES-POD entities. If any of these entities lack a defined alert, the rule will register as a failure.

# Interpretation

A low score in alert coverage may suggest that infrastructure management is not prioritized within your observability strategy, or it may indicate the absence of a standardized approach to infrastructure alerting.

# Actions to Consider

- ***Review Infrastructure Entity Coverage:*** Evaluate your infrastructure entities in relation to your observability goals. Consider entities from cloud integrations, agent extensions, or Prometheus if they play a significant role in your telemetry data. Update the scorecard rule to reflect the unique aspects of your infrastructure.
- ***Adjust Rule Applicability:*** If New Relic is not central to your infrastructure observability, consider disabling or removing the rule.
- ***Refine Rule Query:*** A low score might result from capturing an inappropriate cohort of entities. Modify the NRQL query to focus on production infrastructure entities more accurately.
- ***Develop an Alerting Strategy:*** Optimize the rule for your needs, then review or develop an alerting strategy that includes infrastructure alerting.

# Important Considerations

* Custom Evaluation: Remember, these rules and scores are not an exact science. It's crucial to evaluate them based on your specific needs and conditions. Tailor your measurements to align with your observability goals.
* Continuous Improvement: Observability strategies should evolve. Regularly review and adjust your approach to ensure it meets your current requirements.

By understanding your score and taking the recommended actions, you can enhance your infrastructure observability and ensure it aligns with your broader monitoring strategy.
