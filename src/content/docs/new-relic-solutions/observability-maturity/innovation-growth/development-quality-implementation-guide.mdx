## Overview [#overview]
High quality code is key to an organization's ability to innovate and grow.  Poor quality code diverts engineering time that could be used for innovation, instead wasting it on troubleshooting and fixing.  Poor quality code also has a strong negative impact on customer satisfaction and revenue.  

Overall, a business’ digital operations are only as stable as their code.  Without a stable code-base, engineering will never have time to meet even basic demand for new features, let alone move at the pace required to reach the leading edge.

The Development Quality (DevQual) use case defined here identifies specific key performance indicators and processes that drive stability through code quality improvement.  DevQual is the first use case in the Innovation and Growth value stream.  DevQual is followed by the Release Quality and Release Cadence use cases.  All three use cases must be performed in order.

You are a good candidate for the development quality use case if:
  - You are not measuring code quality.
  - Your code quality is percieved as poor.
  - You do not understand where your developers are spending their time.
  - Your organization suffers from too many outages due to application defects.

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]

DevQual leverages your existing development toolchain and Agile practices to reach the overall gual of reducing code defects, thus improving stability and customer satisfaction.  Improved stability, in turn, frees up valuable developer time for innovation and growth.

Organizations that successfully implement this use case can then move on to improving business impact through the release quality use case, and then increase the velocity of innovation with the release cadence use case.

## Key performance indicators [#key-perf-indicators]

You will use the development quality process to collect and measure the following KPIs:

[**Stability**](#kpi-stability)
- Build success
- Unit test success
- Code coverage
- Defect volume

[**Velocity**](#kpi-velocity)
- Code commit rate

The velocity KPI will measure the speed with which new code is written and committed.  The stability KPIs will measure the quality of the submitted code.

These KPIs will help you to identify the sources of code defects and the areas that require the most developer effort so that you can focus your attention on reducing defects and more efficiently using your engineering talent.  They will also help you to understand if development velocity has any impact on code quality.

Detailed information on each metric follows.

### Stability [#kpi-stability]

    Build success measures the number of times new code is successfully compiled or integrated into the overall application.
    
    **Goal:** Increase the build success rate to nearly 100%  
      
    **Best practices:**  
    Code build events should include the following attributes:
    - Build ID
    - Build name 
    - Build result (success / failure)
    - Build duration
      
  </Collapser>

    Unit test success measures the percentage of unit tests new code passes.
    
    **Goal:** Increase the test success rate.  
      
    **Best practices:**  
    Unit tests should:
    - Test one use case.
    - Complete quickly.
    - Be reliable.
    - Have no inter- or external- dependencies.
    - Have simple and easy to maintain code.
    
    Unit test events should include the following attributes:
      - Test name 
      - Commit being tested
      - Test duration 
      - Test result (success / failure)
    
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-code-coverage"
      title="Code coverage KPI"
  >
    Code coverage measures the amount of an application’s code base that is subject to at least one unit test.
    
    **Goal:** Increase code coverage to 100%.  
      
    **Best practices:**
    Follow the [unit test](#kpi-unit-test-success) best practices to ensure that code test coverage reaches the 100% goal.

  <Collapser
      id="kpi-defect-volume"
      title="Defect volume KPI"
  >
    Defect volume measures the number of defects introduced into an application by a specific module of code.
    
    **Goal:** Reduce the number of new defects.
    **Best practices:**  
    - Identify the sources of new defects by relating them to specific services and code modules.
    
    Code defect events should include the following atributes:
      - Timestamp
      - Application
      - Code module
      - Reference to defect

    Code commit rate measures the number of new code commits over time.
    
    **Goal:** Code commit rate should be correlated against defect volume to identify the optimal balance between velocity and stability.

    **Best practices:**  
    Code commit events should include the following attributes:
      - Timestamp
      - User 
      - Project
      - Repository
      - Branch
      - Commit ID or hash

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the [New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course](https://learn.newrelic.com/overview-course). You should also have a basic understanding of:

- [New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL](https://learn.newrelic.com/webinar-getting-started-with-dashboards-nrql)
- [New Relic One alerting best practices](https://learn.newrelic.com/webinar-new-relic-alerts-fundamentals)

## Establish current state of your KPIs [#current-state]

As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of DevQual is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks:

- [Gather the required KPIs](#gather-kpis)
- [Implement the DevQual Dashboards](#implement-dashboards)
- [Establish a baseline](#establish-baseline)
- [Perform initial enablement](#perform-enablement-one)
- [Start continuous improvement process](#start-continuous-improvement)

### Gather the required KPIs [#gather-kpis]

As with any quality initative, we need to start by gathering our key performance indicators.  In order to do this, you need to identify the specific technology platforms that support your development processes, such as source code repositories and build / test automation platforms.  Once those platforms are identified, you will need to identify methods for extracting each KPI's attributes and importing them into the New Relic platform.

The KPIs and minimum required attributes required by this use case are listed in the [key performance indicators](#key-perf-indicators) section. Typically, you will use your development toolchain's APIs to extract the KPIs and their attributes and then submit them to the New Relic platform using the [custom events API.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/)

Prior to starting any custom integration work, you should determine if any out-of-box integrations exist.  

### Implement the DevQual dashboards [#implement-dashboards]

The DevQual dashboards are the primary technological drivers of the quality improvement process.  They will show your current KPIs and help you to identify the areas which require improvement.

Sample DevQual dashboards can be [found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub.](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center)

The information you present in the dashboards is dependent on your development toolchain, so your dashboard will need to be modified from the sample.  

### Establish a baseline [#establish-baseline]

The DevQual process requires enough data to form a baseline before you can [perform the initial enablement](#perform-enablement-one).  Your baseline should consist of a representative sample of development activity.  Normally, this will be a minimum of two weeks, but it can be up to six weeks, depending on your current development pace.  One easy way to do this is to align your baseline collection and evaluation cycle with your Agile sprints.

You should periodically ensure that DevQual event data is accumulating as expected.

### Perform initial enablement [#perform-enablement-one]

You will introduce development teams and other stakeholders to the baseline DevQual data and the ongoing continuous improvement process you will be following.

The process consists of three activities:

1.  Review the DevQual KPIs and trends - You and the stakeholders will look at the DevQual KPIs and identify trends.

2.  Identfy achievements, challenges, and opportunities - In this phase, you will identify areas where KPIs are improving (achievements) and areas where they are not improving (challenges).  You will then identify strategies and tactics for improving KPIs (opportunities) and determine how to implement them.

3.  Make technical recommendations - Here, you and the relevant stakeholders will identify and review technical recommendations, such as making changes to your development toolchain or observability strategies.

You can use the [session template presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FflqMMVejwn6HMjEni8igZh6UR0a3_JbuMcS5xlZiJU/edit?usp=sharing) to keep this part of the DevQual process organized.

## Improvement process [#improvement-process]

This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process.  During this phase you will repeate the [initial enablement steps](#perform-enablement-one) to review your progress against your baseline and adjust your strategies and tactics so you deliver the required positive business outcome.

Each cycle of the improvment process should occur after several iterations of your development process.  Typically, this is approximately every 2 - 3 weeks, at the mid-point and end of every Agile sprint.

During this phase you should:

-   Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached.

-   Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement.

You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your DevQual goals.

## Value realization [#value-realization]

As you establish the DevQual process, you will see increased application stability and a gradual reduction in the effort required to fix defects. In time, this will result in a reduction in your feature backlog.

After you are on the path to those goals, you should move along to the [release quality](#release-quality) and [release cadence](#release-cadence) use cases.
