metaDescription: Release quality's overall goal is to reduce the size and scope of releases, while increasing release frequency, thus increasing the rate of innovation while also reducing the blast radius of failed production deployments.
---
## Overview [#overview]
A development team is ultimately measured by the frequency and success of its releases. Teams that release too infrequently will not be able to keep pace with business demands and innovation. Teams that create too many unsuccessful releases (i.e. releases that fail to deploy, or have too many defects or performance problems) will have a negative impact on customer satisfaction, revenue, and overall system stability.

The [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) team has identified (four key metrics)[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance] that indicate the performance of a software development organization.  The Innovation and Growth value driver uses those metrics, and a few others, to create an overall program that drives more efficient and responsive development teams, along with more reliable and performant applications. The Release Quality (RelQual) use case contributes to that program by driving deployment frequency, application performance, and application reliability.

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]
Release quality's overall goal is to create a continuous improvement cycle which will reduce the risks to business reputation and earnings and increase application performance and reliability.

You will use RelQual's processes to:
  
- Increase the frequency of deployments while reducing their size and scope. This will result in a faster time for an idea to be implemented in production code, while also reducing the impact (or blast radius) of software defects.

- Identify performance bottlenecks and sources of errors and feed them back into the development process so they can be resolved. This will increase reliability and customer satisfaction.


## Key concepts [#key-concepts]

### Communicate, remediate, innovate [#communicate]
One of the central themes of observability maturity is "Communicate, remediate, innovate." RelQual supports that theme by enabling you to communicate the current state of your development practices and applications to stakeholders using specific KPIs. You will then use those KPIs to adjust your development practices and to identify slow and unreliable application components so they can be fixed in subsequent development sprints. Finally, you will use those KPIs to accelerate your development practices, thus adding additional time to innovate.

### Trunk based development [#trunk]
[Trunk-based development is a practice identified by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) organization](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development) as a key capability that drives faster delivery and higher organizational performance. It is a required practice for CI/CD.

Trunk-based development divides development work into small batches which are performed against branches of a single trunk. As soon as the batch of work is completed, the branch is merged back into the trunk. Each branch is expected to have a short lifetime, making merges back into the trunk simple and ensuring every developer is working from a recent release of the code base.

RelQual drives the adoption of this DevOps best practice and ensures that you adhere to it. By doing so, you will accelerate the delivery of code into production.

### IT service boundary [#it-boundary]
The RelQual use case works at the level of the IT service boundary. By measuring the service at the boundary, we get a picture of what is happening upstream from it.

[Observability maturity's SLM use case](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/slm-implementation-guide) uses the service boundary concept to measure the response time and error rate of the service and its dependencies. RelQual uses the same concept to measure the impact that your development practices have on the service and then to improve your development team's responsiveness, ability to innovate, and application stability as the IT service evolves.

## Key performance indicators [#key-perf-indicators]

You will use the development quality process to collect and measure the following KPIs:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-release-rate"
      title="Release rate KPI"
  >
    Release rate measures the number of releases over time.  Release events should include the following attributes:
    - The application's name
    - The release's unique identifier (SHA signature, version number, etc.)
    - The number of lines of code added
    - The number of lines of code removed
    - The date and time the release occurred
    - The user or process that deployed the release
    - The URL that points at this release in the source code repository
    - An indicator that shows if this release is new or a rollback


    **Goal:** Increase the rate of releases.

    **Best practices:**
    - Use continuous improvement processes to drive a higher release rate.
    - Minimize the number of changes in each release to reduce the impact of release failures.
    - Map this KPI back to business impact and report it to stakeholders.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-release-size-scope"
      title="Release size/scope KPI"
  >
    Release size/scope measures the number of lines of code added or removed. As an alternative, it can measure the percentage of the code base changed.

    This KPI should be included as an attribute of a release event as defined by the Release rate KPI.

    **Goal:** Reduce the size/scope of each release.

    **Best practices:**
    - Minimize the number of changes in each release to reduce the impact of release failures.
    - Map this KPI back to business impact and report it to stakeholders.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-app-resp-errors"
      title="App transaction responsiveness and errors KPI"
  >
    The App responsiveness and errors KPI measures the release's 95th percentile response time and volume of errors.

    You should use observability instrumentation to collect this KPI for every transaction at the application's service boundary. The KPI's attributes should, at minimum, include the following:
    - Transaction name and/or URI
    - The transaction's start wall clock time
    - The transaction's duration
    - The compute resource that serviced the request

    **Goal:** Improve response time and reduce errors.

    **Best practices:**
    - Use Service Level Management techniques to create more responsive applications with fewer user facing errors.
    - Use this KPI to prioritize engineering's performance enhancement efforts.
    - Use your observability solution to feed back information on bottlenecks and blame components to your development teams so they can fix them.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-production-impact"
      title="Production impact KPI"
  >
    Production impact measures the number of failed releases (such as releases that were rolled back or failed to deploy).

    This KPI should be included as an attribute of a release event as defined by the release rate KPI.

    **Goal:** Reduce the number of failed releases.
    **Best practices:**
    - Ensure you realistically test your deployments in non-production environments prior to moving them to production.
    - Perform in-depth retrospectives on failed deployments so you can discover and fix gaps in your testing and deployment processes.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-observability-coverage"
      title="Observability coverage KPI"
  >
    This KPI measures the percentage of the application that has observability instrumentation.

    **Goal:** 100% coverage
    **Best practices:**
    - Add diagnostic instrumentation to the application's main components.
    - Use SLO attainment failures to drive diagnostic processes to identify and fill observability gaps.
    - Use incident retrospectives to identify and fill observability gaps.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-support-ticket-volume"
      title="Support ticket volume KPI (optional)"
  >
    Support ticket volume measures the number of support tickets opened against this release. This is an optional KPI.

    This KPI should be collected as an hourly or daily metric which has the following attributes:
    - Application name and release
    - Timestamp
    - Number of tickets opened by severity
    - Mean time to close by severity

    **Goal:** Reduce the number of tickets.
    **Best practices:**
    - Ensure support tickets can be correlated against specific releases.
    - Analyze support tickets to understand the kinds of issues encountered, and use that info to drive continuous improvement.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
      id="kpi-infra-costs"
      title="Infrastructure cost KPI (optional)"
  >
    This KPI measures the application's hosting costs. It is an optional KPI.

    **Goal:** Create a predictable and stable cost model.
    **Best practices:**
    - Measure the costs of each application's hosting infrastructure.
    - Periodically review the application's performance vs. cost metrics to ensure the application has resources appropriate to its function and business importance.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, you should complete the [New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course](https://learn.newrelic.com/overview-course). You should also have a basic understanding of:

- [New Relic One Fundamentals](https://learn.newrelic.com/fundamentals-course)
- [Introduction to Instrumentation](https://learn.newrelic.com/self-paced-intro-to-instrumentation-with-new-relic)
- [New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL](https://learn.newrelic.com/webinar-getting-started-with-dashboards-nrql)

## Establish current state of your KPIs [#current-state]

As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of RelQual is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks:

- [Identify the application](#identify-application)
- [Gather the required KPIs](#gather-kpis)
- [Implement the RelQual dashboards](#implement-dashboards)
- [Establish a baseline](#establish-baseline)
- [Perform initial enablement](#perform-enablement-one)
- [Start continuous improvement process](#start-continuous-improvement)

### Identify the application [#identify-application]

The first step is for you to identify the application or applications that are in-scope for the first iterations of the RelQual process. Applications that are good candidates for inclusion in the RelQual process are ones that:
- Are actively being developed
- Are a key operational service
- Need to be released to production more frequently
- Have a track record of failed deployments or post-deployment issues

### Gather the required KPIs [#gather-kpis]

The success of the release quality use case is highly dependent on its key performance indicators. You need to start by ensuring you gather the RelQual KPIs from primary sources such as your CI/CD platform, source repository, observability solution, etc. Once you identify the sources for your KPIs, you will need to identify methods for extracting them and importing them into the New Relic platform.

The KPIs and minimum required attributes required by this use case are listed in the [key performance indicators](#key-perf-indicators) section. Typically, you will use your development toolchain's APIs to extract the KPIs and their attributes and then submit them to the New Relic platform using the [custom events API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/).

Prior to starting any custom integration work, you should determine if any out-of-box integrations exist.  [Some out-of-box integrations can be found here.](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects)

### Implement the RelQual dashboards [#implement-dashboards]

The RelQual dashboards are the primary drivers of the quality improvement process. They will show KPIs and trends so you can identify and prioritize your improvement efforts.

Sample RelQual dashboards can be [found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center).

Some of the information you present in the dashboards is dependent on your development toolchain, so your dashboard may need to be modified from the sample.

### Establish a baseline [#establish-baseline]

The RelQual process requires a baseline so you can [perform the initial enablement](#perform-enablement-one). Your baseline should include a representative sample of your release activity.  This should include at least one complete release cycle, but may require more cycles to get a valid baseline.

Your baseline collection and evaluation cycle should be aligned with your Agile sprints, and you should periodically ensure that RelQual event data is accumulating as expected.

### Perform initial enablement [#perform-enablement-one]

In this stage, you will introduce development teams and other stakeholders to the baseline RelQual data and the ongoing continuous improvement process you will be following.

The process consists of four activities:

1. **Introduce the concepts of trunk based development.** You and the stakeholders will review the core concepts of truck based development, identify where your current practices differ, and then create strategies to implement it.

2. **Review your release KPIs and trends.** You will review the release rate and release size/scope KPIs to ensure you are making progress towards implementing trunk based development. Your goal is to increase your release rate while reducing the size/scope of new releases.

3. **Review your application KPIs and trends.** Here, you will review your application's performance and error KPIs to identify and prioritize your efforts towards improving application reliability and performance.

4. **Make technical recommendations.** Here, you and the relevant stakeholders will identify and review technical recommendations, such as making changes to your release workflows or observability strategies.

You can use the [session template presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FflqMMVejwn6HMjEni8igZh6UR0a3_JbuMcS5xlZiJU/edit?usp=sharing) to keep this part of the RelQual process organized.


## Improvement process [#improvement-process]

This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process. During this phase you will repeat [the initial enablement steps](#perform-enablement-one) to review your progress against your baseline and adjust your strategies and tactics so you deliver the required positive business outcome.

Each cycle of the improvement process should occur after several iterations of your release process. As an alternative, you can schedule evaluations at the mid-point and end of each Agile sprint.

During this phase you should:

- Report your KPIs to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work, and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached.

- Record and retain your weekly KPIs over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement.

Keep in mind that this is a continuous improvement process. Continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your RelQual goals.

## Value realization [#value-realization]

Once your implementation of the RelQual process becomes mature, you will see a reduction in the business and technical risks associated with application deployments and improved application performance. This will result in improvements to customer satisfaction, reduced overhead costs, and an improvement in earnings potential.

After you are on the path to those goals, you should move along to [development quality](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/innovation-growth/development-quality-implementation-guide).
