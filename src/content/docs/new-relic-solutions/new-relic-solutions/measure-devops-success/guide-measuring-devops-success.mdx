Follow these guides to enable your DevOps team for success. The solutions in these guides provide best practices for using New Relic at every stage of measuring DevOps success: [Preparing](#prepare), [Activating](#activate), and [Optimizing](#optimize). Each of these guides focus on identifying key performance metrics and creating a greater digital experience for customers. Monitoring with New Relic from the beginning to the end of your journey lets you measure your DevOps impact at every step of the way.

## Prepare your DevOps team [#prepare]

Preparing your DevOps team for measurable success starts by setting clear service level objectives (SLOs), and putting instrumentation in place to quantitatively understand progress.

* [Establish objectives and baselines](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/measure-devops-success/establish-objectives-baselines-define-team-slos)
* [Setup proactive alerting](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/measure-devops-success/set-proactive-alerting-understand-respond-performance-issues)

## Activate well-defined processes [#activate]

Define and hone your process using New Relic [Alerts](/docs/alerts), [APM](/docs/apm), and [Insights](/docs/insights).
