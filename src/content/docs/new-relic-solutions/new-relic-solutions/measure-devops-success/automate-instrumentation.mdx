Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errorsâ€”and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows.

## Prerequisite

Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the [Measure code pipeline](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/measure-devops-success/measure-code-pipelines) tutorial.

## 1. Make instrumentation part of every build [#make-instrumentation-build]

Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently.

Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the [New Relic Terraform Provider,](https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic) you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a [dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) when you start up a new service.

## 2. Take advantage of CLI tools [#cli-tools]

Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The [New Relic Lambda CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli) installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the [NR-1 CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/nr1-cli) to build and share your own New Relic applications.

## 3. Leverage the power of APIs [#leverage-apis]

Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The [New Relic API Explorer](/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls.

The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including:

* [APIs to set up alert conditions](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts)
* [APIs to define synthetic monitors](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api)
* [APIs to create dashboards](/docs/insights/insights-api/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-api)
