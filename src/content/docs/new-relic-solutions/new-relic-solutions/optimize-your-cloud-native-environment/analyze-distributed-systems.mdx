In a monolithic application, a simple stack trace can contain enough diagnostic data to determine the root cause of a code defect. But cloud computing and microservices have blurred the lines between software and infrastructure; in modern architectures, requests are distributed across many smaller services—often with ephemeral lifespans—hosted in both on-premise and cloud environments. Spotting code defects becomes much more complex. APM's distributed tracing automatically helps teams troubleshoot such distributed systems.

Distributed traces are just one component of a well-monitored system. You need a holistic view of your distributed system, especially when tracking the root cause of a defect, as there are volumes of data to evaluate and understand. When managing a microservices environment, it's critical that you have the capability to spot bottlenecks and problem spans quickly so that you don't compromise your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) or end-user experience.

At New Relic, we understand these challenges inherently. In our journey, we've transitioned from a Ruby monolith to a multi-language distributed environment built on more than 300 microservices, for which we average 50 code deploys a day. Such challenges inform both how we've built and how we monitor New Relic.

Use the New Relic platform to translate your data into relevant insights, so you can collaborate around a common framework to build context and quickly optimize and troubleshoot your complex, distributed systems.

## 1. Identify high-priority areas to monitor [#identify-areas]

Distributed systems are complex. Before engaging with the New Relic platform, we recommend that you identify the most critical areas of your systems to observe, and focus on instrumenting those high-priority areas first. Google's [SRE handbook suggests monitoring the "four golden signals"](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals): traffic, latency, errors, and saturation, as shown in the following dashboard:

![4signals.png](./images/4signals.png "4signals.png")

  **Dashboards**: Visualize key areas to monitor with dashboards.
</figcaption>

Too often, teams monitor what is either 1) easy to measure or 2) interpretable. Avoid this fallacy. When making choices about what to monitor, involve product managers and other stakeholders from your organization. Your goal is to monitor what matters to your business, not to overload your teams with noise.

## 2. Instrument to get the visibility you require [#instrument]

Once you've identified your key priorities, instrument the appropriate parts of your system with the New Relic platform.

* Monitor your web apps with [APM](/docs/apm). See [compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents) to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language and then [install the APM agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent) on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language.
* [Enable distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing) for APM, which will affect some existing APM features. If you're accustomed to using APM without distributed tracing, read the [transition guide](/docs/distributed-tracing-transition-guide) before you enable this feature.
* Monitor your compute resources with [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure). See [compatibility and requirements for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure) for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list).
* Monitor your front-end experience with [mobile](/docs/mobile) and [browser](/docs/browser). 

## 3. Create dashboards [#insights-dashboards]

Use [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to get an overview of your entire system and baseline performance, so you can better understand how the components work together. Insights provides a single framework for aligning disparate teams around relevant data. Approach this first build as your launching point, giving your teams something to react to as you begin to ascribe context to your system. You should continue to build and iterate your dashboards as you analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your distributed system.

Even after you have a basic understanding of your system, use dashboards to inform the decisions you make going forward. Dashboards provide central repository of truth, allowing all stakeholders to build context about the health of your system. Here is an example of a query that displays the slowest applications.

```
SELECT percentile(duration, 99) as 'Slowest duration' FROM Transaction FACET name
```

Using this query you can focus on the slowest application to dig deeper:

![slowest_transaction.png](./images/slowest_transaction.png "slowest_transaction.png")

<figcaption>
  After running the query, dashboards displays the slowest durations.

## 4. Dig deeper with distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing]

After you have basic instrumentation and contextual dashboards in place, you can begin to dig deeper to troubleshoot or optimize your system. A differentiated feature in [New Relic One's Global Distributed Tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/additional-distributed-tracing-features-new-relic-one) is that you can come in with vague context for what you're investigating and search across **all** accounts and traces to get down to the actual user interactions that have those attributes _somewhere_ in their trace. You no longer must begin with the application or specific entity to search for traces that include that application.

For example, start with an analysis of your complex service calls, using the [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) UI to:

* View a scatter plot chart showing the frequency, duration, and other facets of your distributed traces
* Group traces by root entry, service, service entry, or traces with errors
* View a trace list
* Filter specific traces to meet certain parameters

You'll likely discover that you want to take the analysis one step further by annotating your traces with information that adds context to your troubleshooting, like User ID. You can do this in New Relic using [custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes).

## 5. Annotate message queues with distributed tracing payload APIs [#annotate-queues]

To see connections between services in some environments—for example, in a system that relies heavily on queues—you may need to do some manual instrumentation using the [distributed tracing payload APIs](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) to ensure you're propagating the payload. This gives agents the necessary context to create spans with the right correlation; you'll see end-to-end traces for all linked services, including those that cross through the queue.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id=""
    title="Example annotated message queue"
  >
    For example:

    1. Start a transaction.
    2. Create the distributed tracing payload on the producer service within a New Relic transaction.
    3. As part of the message, add the distributed tracing payload.

       ```
       ​​newrelic.setTransactionName("Send Message")
        // Create SQS service object
        var sqs = new AWS.SQS({apiVersion: '2012-11-05'});
        var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction();
        var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload();
        var jsonPayload = payload.text();

       //add the jsonPayload as a MessageAttribute
        var params = {
           DelaySeconds: 10,
           MessageAttributes: {
             "Testing": {
               DataType: "String",
               StringValue: "123"
           },
           "TraceContext": {
             DataType: "String",
             StringValue: jsonPayload
           }
         },
         MessageBody: "Testing 123",
       QueueUrl: "https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/408155283954/sqs-testing"
         };
       ```
    4. With the context of a transaction, receive the payload on the consumer service.

       ```
       sqs.receiveMessage(params, function(err, data) {
          if (err) {
            console.log("Receive Error", err);
          } else if (data && data.Messages) {
            console.log("trace context:")
            var traceContext = 
       data.Messages[0].MessageAttributes.TraceContext.StringValue;
            if (traceContext != "") {
              var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction();
              transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(traceContext);
            }
       ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## 6. Annotate and tag traces with custom attributes

We recommend that you use [custom attributes](/docs/apm/other-features/attributes/collecting-custom-attributes) to decorate events with additional information for better tracing. For example, by adding key-value pairs, you can attach a user ID to trace a specific user through the call stack and review failing requests to determine if that user is having an unusually poor experience.

We recommend adding custom attributes based on your use case; for example, if your instrumenting an order management system, you could add an order number custom attribute to your traces.

To add custom attributes, you must first enable them for your agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For more agent-specific information on collecting custom attributes, see [Collect custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes)
</Callout>

```
sqs.sendMessage(params, function(err, data) {
   if (err) {
     res.send("Error: "+ err);
   } else {
     res.send("Success! Message ID: "+ data.MessageId);
     newrelic.addCustomAttribute("Message ID", data.MessageId)
   }
 });
```

## 7. Leverage Synthetics to get a high-level view of system health

In complex, distributed systems, you need to track and monitor many signals. Sometimes it may be that no one signal is concerning, yet your whole system is behaving anomalously. To get a complete picture, it's critical to analyze symptomatic data in tandem with system-level data. [Synthetics](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) allows you to interact with the entire system as an external user would, giving your teams high-level checks for performance and user experience. These external checks help you understand if the entire system is doing what you want regardless of what specific signals may indicate.
