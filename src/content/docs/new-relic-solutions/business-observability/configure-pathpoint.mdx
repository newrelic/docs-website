New Relic Pathpoint offers a flexible configuration system that can be customized to meet the unique needs of your business. Pathpoint supports configuration from an interactive GUI.  It's also possible to download and upload a JSON configuration.  That is particularly useful when wanting to version control a configuration. 

This level of customization empowers you to create a tailored observability solution that fits your organization's specific requirements.

On this page, you'll learn:

* How to configure Pathpoint with the GUI
* How to use JSON interchange format

## Configuring Pathpoint with the GUI

There are three icons that will let you access each of the three main editors in Pathoint.

## Using the JSON interchange format

It is extremely easy and intuitive to construct a Pathpoint implementation using the stages, steps, and touchpoints editors shown in the previous section.  Sometimes it will be useful or necessary to store the configuration in a file and import that configuration at a later time possibly in another account or Pathpoint instance.  For a production Pathpoint implementation we strongly recommend storing an archive of your configuration as JSON in a version control system such as git.

### Download your current configuration as JSON

Pathpoint provides the flexibility to download the current JSON config file directly to your computer. This feature is particularly useful if you need to make changes to the file.

To download the currently active JSON config file:

<Steps>

<Step>

From your New Relic account, go to **Apps > Pathpoint**. Click on the <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" /> in the upper left corner. 


</Step>

<Step>

Click **JSON configuration**.

</Step>

<Step>

Next, click on the down arrow.

<img
  title="download active JSON config file"
  alt="download active JSON config file"
  src={downloadFile}
/>

</Step>

Your active JSON config file is now downloaded.

</Steps>

### Replace your current configuration by uploading a JSON file

To load a new JSON config file:

<Steps>

<Step>

From your New Relic account, navigate to **Apps > Pathpoint**, and click <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" />.

</Step>

<Step>

On the resulting window, click **JSON configuration**.


</Step>

<Step>

This opens a dialog box window. Under **Description**, describe your new JSON config file. Next, provide a note and click **From file** to browse the JSON config file.

<img
  title="Upload new JSON config file"
  alt="Upload new JSON config file"
  src={uploadJson}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Locate the JSON config file you want to use to update your Pathpoint, and click **Open**.

<img
  title="open new JSON config file"
  alt="open new JSON config file"
  src={openFile}
/>

</Step>

Finally, the Pathpoint is displayed with the updates of the particular JSON file you chose.

</Steps>
