New Relic Pathpoint is an enterprise platform tracker that offers a unique approach to business process observability. It models system health in relation to actual business and user-impacting concepts specific to your digital business.

By monitoring and analyzing the health and performance of all components of the customer journey, including all internal processes and external dependencies, Pathpoint allows organizations to easily identify and resolve issues that impact the customer journey, optimize internal processes, and improve the overall customer experience.

## Overview of Pathpoint resources [#overview-docs]

The sections below cover important concepts and procedures about Pathpoint.

## Pathpoint elements [#elements]

Pathpoint can be a key part of optimizing your business observability. It maps an organization's business process or "customer journey" to tangible signals from various services, alerts, and infrastructure to help you rapidly pinpoint where your business or customer journey is impacted.  This top down approach to observability allows you share observability data with a wide variety of technical and non-technical personnel.
Each Pathpoint flow is divided into:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-stages" title="Stages"> 

These are the highest level business stages. At the actual system level these will be a rollup of many services and methods and show the complete health, congestion, count and infrastructure state of a Pathpoint.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint stages"
        alt="Pathpoint stages"
        src={stages}
    />

The different stages of a Pathpoint enables you to gain a high-level overview of business processes and identify the different services and methods presented at the system level for each commercial stage.

### Adding stages [#adding-stages]
    
Adding stages is as fast as typing in the stage names.  

    <img
        title="Add stages"
        alt="Add stages"
        src={addSteps}
    />

### Get real-time and historical information for each stage [#real-time-info-for-stage]

View real-time details for each stage, including any errors. Stages are color-coded to indicate their status: green for normal operation, yellow for critical signals, and red for multiple anomalies requiring attention.

In addition to the current state of these indicators, Pathpoint allows for the vizualization of previous states (recently and not so recently) using "playback".

    <img
        title="Pathpoint playback"
        alt="Pathpoint plaback"
        src={playback}
    />


</Collapser>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-steps" title="Steps"> 

Steps are "sub-stages" of a parent stage and represent the various events occurring throughout the stage.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint steps"
        alt="Pathpoint steps"
        src={steps}
    />


Steps break down stages but also offer a level of abstraction. Often steps can be represented in some sequential order, known as levels. This allows New Relic to intuitively understand if there is some sequential dependencies between steps.

### Adding steps [#adding-steps]

        src={addSteps}
    />

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="pathpoint-signals" title="Signals">

Signals are the most granular elements in the Pathpoint model. They are often a specific application monitored by our <InlinePopover type="apm" /> or <InlinePopover type="browser" />, but you can use any New Relic entity or alert as a signal. This provides almost limitless flexibility.

Every signal provides a snapshot of its current status, connected information, and a record of previous states.

    <img
        title="Pathpoint signals"
        alt="Pathpoint signals"
        src={signals}
    />

### Adding signals [#adding-signals]

Adding signals to Pathpoint is as simple as navigating a list of entities and alerts in your account.  It is easy to filter them by name and add only the ones you want.  No custom queries are required.

    <img
        title="Add signals"
        alt="Add signals"
        src={addSignals}
    />

### Signal status [#touchpoint-status]

Like the entities or alerts they are related to signals have three different health statuses, which are color-coded for easy identification:

* Green: Optimal performance. All systems are operating as expected.
* Gray: Requires attention. Potential configuration issues or data gaps exist, such as a missing alert or the telemetry is not available.
* Red: Critical failure. Immediate action is necessary.

Each Pathpoint step relies on one or more signals, making signal health crucial to overall Pathpoint performance. By tracking signal status, you can effectively monitor system health and quickly identify issues.

<Callout variant="tip">
    By default, you'll only see all signals. However you can choose to see "unhealthy only" or "critical only" to simplify your view.
</Callout>

### View signal details [#view-signal-details]

Signals linked to a New Relic entity adopt the entity's health status. Clicking a signal icon displays a window with detailed signal information, including:

* Open incidents
* Golden signal status
* Link to the entity's details page for deeper analysis


    <img
        title="View signal details"
        alt="View signal details"
        src={signalDetails}
    />

<Collapser id="business-flow-kpis" title="Business flow KPIs"> 

Beyond structured signals tied to New Relic entities or alerts, Pathpoint supports flexible KPI tracking via custom NRQL queries. This enables correlation of lower-level entity health with broader business impact metrics. Common use cases include monitoring event counts (such as user logins, registrations, checkouts, cart abandonment, etc.) and monetary values (such as total checkout value, returned product value, etc.). These KPIs can be derived from existing telemetry sources such as logs, custom metrics, or other data independent of specific entities.

        alt="Pathpoint flow KPIs"

    />

</Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

By tracking each of these components, Pathpoint provides a comprehensive view of how customers interact with an organization at every stage of their journey. This makes it possible to identify and diagnose issues quickly, optimize the customer experience, and make data-driven decisions to drive better business outcomes.
