Business Observability is the art of capturing, measuring and managing the live interaction between IT telemetry and Business analytics.

Typically observability strategy is built in silos, and connecting the dots back to the business is reactive/ an afterthought/ extremely difficult. Business o11y is about actively aligning key initiatives to the performance of systems, applications, and processes.
By implementing Business Observability practices, organizations can make informed decisions that impact their entire operations and achieve significant financial gains.

Here's an example of how New Relic helps large organizations monitor and analyze a wide range of data no matter where it comes from in your system. And having this visibility all in one place will help you more efficiently optimize your processes.

## Next steps [#next-steps]

We provide many solutions to help you with your business observability practice. Here are some of the main strategies used by our larger customers. 

### Reporting custom data [#custom-data]

We report a lot of helpful data by default, but to get the most out of using New Relic, you'll want to report custom data that contains information that's unique and meaningful to your business. 

Before adding any custom data, you should come up with a plan of how it will work, to make sure it will be an efficient, organized implementation (and won't create too much "noisy" data).

Methods of adding custom data include: 

* Configuring your existing agents and integrations
* Using agent APIs
* Using our Metric, Event, Log, and Trace APIs to bring any data you want in

For tips for adding custom data, see [Custom data](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/get-custom-data-from-any-source).

### Custom UI visualizations [#visualizations]

Just as you can customize the data you bring in, you can customize your visualizations of that data to match your business structure. Examples of this: 

* Create [custom dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) that are aimed at solving specific business problems
* Create [workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads), which are business-important groupings of your monitored entities 

### Pathpoint [#pathpoint]

We also have New Relic Pathpoint, which lets you more easily understand your entire system. [Get started with PathPoint](/docs/business-observability/pathpoint).
