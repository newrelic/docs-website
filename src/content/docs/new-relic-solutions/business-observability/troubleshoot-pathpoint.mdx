Pathpoint allows you to execute different troubleshooting tasks using our [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring). You can run these tasks in the background so you can proactively identify and resolve issues before they have a significant impact on your customer experience. 

You'll learn to troubleshoot your Pathpoint using:

* Canary filter
* Flame filter
* Drop filter

## Canary filter [#canary]

The Canary filter is a highly effective tool for troubleshooting your Pathpoint implementation. When activated, it limits Pathpoint's calculations to only the steps that are manually activated, allowing you to pinpoint and understand the specific operation of a particular step. 

This feature can be especially helpful when troubleshooting issues with a specific step, during code deployment or system maintenance, when you need to narrow your view.

    alt="Steps"
    src={steps}
/>

On this Pathpoint, you can see all the different steps that are active right now. To troubleshoot this Pathpoint, you can turn off all active steps and then enable them one by one, while also turning on the Canary filter. This approach helps to isolate any problematic steps or touchpoints in the customer journey, allowing for targeted debugging and optimization.

To activate the filter:

<Steps>

<Step>

Click on the <img src={canaryIcon} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Canary Symbol Icon" title="Canary Symbol Icon" /> located on the top right part of the Pathpoint window.



</Step>

<Step>

In the window that appears, click **Continue** to activate this filter. 

</Step>

<Step>

Once the filter is active, it changes its color to yellow. Now, you can click on any of the steps you want to troubleshoot.

    alt="Active Canary Filter"
    src={activeCanaryFilter}
/>

</Step>

Enabling a step also enables the corresponding touchpoints tied to the step.

</Steps>

## Flame filter [#flame-filter]

The Flame filter highlights the most problematic steps and touchpoints with a configurable time window and percentile threshold. When using this filter, you see the worst-performing touchpoints highlighted in red, making it easy to identify the areas that require attention. For example, the filter can help you identify touchpoints that are not meeting the threshold percentage set in the tuning. 

This is very useful in situations where things look okay now, but might have had a pattern of errors or latency in the recent past. 

Before you use this special Pathpoint filter, you must enable the **Flame filter background script**.

### Enable Flame filter background script [#flame-filter-bg-script]

To enable this script:

<Steps>

<Step>

From your New Relic account, navigate to **Apps > Pathpoint**. Click on the <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" /> in the upper left.

</Step>

<Step>

Select **Credentials and general configuration**.

</Step>

<Step>

On the **Credentials and general configuration** window, you see a few options asking you to input an [ingest license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#api-table), and a [user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#api-table) and options to **Enable Pathpoint logging** and **Enable Flame filter background script**.

Fill in the fields and select the checkboxes. Then, click **Save/Update**.

<img
  title="Save/Update Pathpoint Credentials"
  alt="Save/Update Pathpoint Credentials"
  src={credentials}
/>

This takes you back to main Pathpoint window.

</Step>

<Step>

From the main Pathpoint screen, click <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" />.

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Credentials and general configuration**.

</Step>

<Step>

Finally, click **Install/Update Job**.

<img
  title="Install/Update Job"
  alt="Install/Update Job"
  src={installJob}
/>

</Step>

Now, both **Pathpoint logging**, and **Flame filter background script** are enabled.

</Steps>

Once you've enabled the **Flame filter background script**, you can activate the Flame filter and start troubleshooting your Pathpoint.

To activate the Flame filter:

<Steps>

<Step>

Click on the <img src={flameIcon} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="flame symbol" title="flame symbol" /> located on the upper right of the Pathpoint window.


</Step>

<Step>

In the window that appears, click **Continue** to activate this filter. 

</Step>

<Step>

Once it's active, the flame filter changes its color and highlights the problematic touchpoints in red. 

<img
  title="Activated Flame filter"
  alt="Activated Flame filter"
  src={activatedFlameFilter}
/>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Drop filter [#drop-filter]

The Drop filter calculates the order or transaction loss by stage, including the monetary value of these losses based on the values set in the tuning. This filter also enables you to identify the specific steps in the customer journey that are causing these drops.

To activate it:

<Steps>

<Step>

Click on the <img src={tearDropIcon} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="tear drop Icon" title="tear drop Icon" /> in the upper right of the Pathpoint window. 

</Step>

<Step>

Once activated, the filter changes its color to black. Now, you see dollar amount on top of the corresponding step, if at least one of your Steps has a touchpoint of the Drop(DRP) kind.

  title="Activated Drop filter"
  alt="Activated Drop filter"
  src={activatedDropFilter}
