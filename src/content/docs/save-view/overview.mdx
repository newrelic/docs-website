Create, manage, and apply your customized views effortlessly with the Saved views feature. This feature enhances your experience and productivity within the platform, allowing you to save your current view settings and easily return to them later.
It is particularly useful for users who frequently switch between different data sets or configurations.
You can also name your saved view to help you remember its purpose and share it with other users, making it easier to collaborate and ensure everyone is on the same page. This is especially beneficial in team environments where multiple users may need access to the same data sets or configurations.
You can also update or delete saved views that are no longer needed, helping to keep your workspace organized and clutter-free.

## Manage your saved views

To create a saved view in a supported capability such as **Catalogs**, **All Entities**, **Alerts**, or **Infrastructure**, do the following:

1. Navigate to a capability that supports saved views capability.
2. Use the entity filter bar or modify the user interface to apply the desired changes. Saved Views capability captures modifications made both in the filter bar and the user interface. For example, you can add or remove columns from a table, among other adjustments.
3. Once you have applied the changes, locate the **Save View** button at the top left corner of the screen and click to save your view. The **Saved view name** pop-up screen appears.

  />

3. In the **Saved view name** pop-up screen, enter a name for your saved view and select whether you want to share the saved view with everyone in the account or just for you.

4. Click **Save**.
    After the process is completed, the new saved view is automatically applied. Also, the new saved view is listed under the **Saved views** capability.

 To load an existing saved view within a capability that supports **Saved Views** feature, you have two options:

 ### Option 1: Load from saved view dropdown menu

1. Navigate to the desired capability that supports Saved Views, such as **Catalogs**, **All Entities**, **Alerts**, or **Infrastructure**.
2. From the saved view dropdown list, select the saved view that you want to load.

  <img
    title="Load saved view from the capability title dropdown"
    alt="load saved view"
    src="/images/load-saved-view1.webp"
  />

### Option 2: Load from the Saved Views Capability

1. Access the **Saved Views** capability. You can find it on the All Capabilities page.
Alternatively, use Quick Find by pressing ⌘+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows) and search for **Saved Views**.
2. Browse through the list of saved views to locate the one you want to load.
3. Select the desired saved view to load.

  <Collapser id="favourite-saved-view" title="Mark a saved view as favourite">
By marking your favorite saved views, you’ll have quick access to them when you need them the most. Favorit saved views have a predominant location within the **Saved views** dropdown. To set a saved view as favourite, do the following:

1. Load the saved view that you want to save as favorite (from the Saved views dropdown or the Saved views capability).
2. Click the hamburger ‘...’ icon next to the saved view name and click **Add view to favorites**. You can also click the star icon next to the saved view name to add it to your favorites.

  <Collapser id="update-saved-view" title="Update a saved view">
  When modifications are made to the current view, regardless of whether it is a built-in view or a previously loaded Saved view, the saved view title is displayed in italics. Additionally, a **Save** button appears adjacent to the view title.

  Example:

  The following illustrates a scenario where a "Team" filter has been added to a user-created **apm-view-1** view. Consequently, the italicized **apm-view-1** title indicates the presence of unsaved changes. The Save button located next to the title allows you to overwrite the existing **apm-view-1** Saved view with these modifications.
  <img
    title="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    src="/images/edit-saved-view.webp"
  />

  By clicking the **Save** button, the view including the new changes are saved into the existing **My entities apm-view-1**, the title removes its italic font, and the **Save** button disappears.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="delete-saved-view" title="Delete a saved view">
  To delete a saved view, follow these steps:

1. Load the saved view you want to delete (from the Saved views dropdown or the Saved views capability).
2. Click the hamburger ‘...’ icon next to the saved view name and click **Delete saved view**.
