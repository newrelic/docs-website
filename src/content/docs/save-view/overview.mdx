Are you tired of constantly re-applying filters and configurations every time you switch between different datasets? The **Saved Views** feature is designed to eliminate this hassle, boosting your productivity and ensuring consistency in your work.

With Saved Views, you can:

* **Effortlessly save your customized views:** Capture your current filter settings, column selections, and sorting preferences with a single click.
* **Instantly recall frequently used configurations:** No more recreating the same views repeatedly. Simply select a saved view to instantly apply its settings.
* **Enhance team collaboration:** Share your saved views with colleagues to ensure everyone is working with the same data perspective. This is particularly useful in team environments where multiple users need access to specific data sets or configurations.

<Callout variant="important">
Only **Catalogs**, **All Entities**, **Alerts**, and **Infrastructure** capabilities are currently supported by the **Saved Views** feature. The **Saved Views** capability is available on the **All Capabilities** page, allowing you to manage all your saved views in one place.

To create a saved view in a supported capability, do the following:

1. Navigate to a capability that supports saved views capability.
2. Use the entity filter bar or adjust the user interface to make the desired changes. The Saved Views feature captures modifications made in both the filter bar and the user interface, such as adding or removing columns from a table.
3. Once you have applied the changes, click the **Save View** button at the top left corner of the screen.

  />

The **Saved view name** pop-up screen appears.

3. In the **Saved view name** pop-up screen, enter a name for your saved view and select whether you want to share the saved view with everyone in the account or just for you.

4. Click **Save**.
    After the process is completed, the new saved view is automatically applied. Also, the new saved view is listed under the **Saved views** capability.

  <Collapser id="load-saved-view" title="Load an existing Saved View">


 To load an existing saved view within a capability that supports **Saved Views** feature, you have two options:

 ### Option 1: Load from saved view dropdown menu

1. Navigate to the desired capability for which you want to set the filter as favourite.
2. From the saved view dropdown list, select the saved view that you want to load.

  <img
    title="Load saved view from the capability title dropdown"
    alt="load saved view"
    src="/images/load-saved-view1.webp"
  />

### Option 2: Load from the saved views capability

1. Access the **Saved Views** capability. You can find it on the All Capabilities page.
Alternatively, use Quick Find by pressing ⌘+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows) and search for **Saved Views**.
2. Browse through the list of saved views to locate the one you want to load.
3. Select the desired saved view to load.

    src="/images/load-saved-view2.webp"
  />

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="favourite-saved-view" title="Mark a saved view as favourite">
Marking your favorite saved views allows you to access them quickly when needed. Favorite saved views appear prominently in the **Saved Views** dropdown. To mark a saved view as a favorite:

1. Load the saved view that you want to save as favorite (from the Saved views dropdown or the Saved views capability).
2. Click the star icon next to the saved view name to add it to your favorites. You can also  click the hamburger ‘...’ icon next to the saved view name and click **Add view to favorites**.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="update-saved-view" title="Update a saved view">
  When modifications are made to the current view, regardless of whether it is a built-in view or a previously loaded Saved view, the saved view title is displayed in italics. Additionally, a **Save** button appears adjacent to the view title.

  Example:

  The following illustrates a scenario where a "Team" filter has been added to a user-created **apm-view-1** view. Consequently, the italicized **apm-view-1** title indicates the presence of unsaved changes. The Save button located next to the title allows you to overwrite the existing **apm-view-1** Saved view with these modifications.
  <img
    title="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    src="/images/edit-saved-view.webp"
  />

  By clicking the **Save** button, the view including the new changes are saved into the existing **My entities apm-view-1**, the title removes its italic font, and the **Save** button disappears.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="delete-saved-view" title="Delete a saved view">
  To delete a saved view, follow these steps:

1. Load the saved view you want to delete (from the Saved views dropdown or the Saved views capability).
2. Click the hamburger ‘...’ icon next to the saved view name and click **Delete saved view**.
