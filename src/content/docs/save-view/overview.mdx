Create, manage, and apply your customized views effortlessly with the Save view feature. This feature enhances your experience and productivity within the platform, allowing you to save your current view settings and easily return to them later.
It is particularly useful for users who frequently switch between different data sets or configurations, as it allows you to save your current view settings and easily return to them later.
You can also name your saved view to help you remember its purpose and share it with other users, making it easier to collaborate and ensure everyone is on the same page. This is especially beneficial in team environments where multiple users may need access to the same data sets or configurations.
You can also update or delete saved views that are no longer needed, helping to keep your workspace organized and clutter-free.
