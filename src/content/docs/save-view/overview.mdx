Create, manage, and apply your customized views effortlessly with the Saved views feature. This feature enhances your experience and productivity within the platform, allowing you to save your current view settings and easily return to them later.
It is particularly useful for users who frequently switch between different data sets or configurations, as it allows you to save your current view settings and easily return to them later.
You can also name your saved view to help you remember its purpose and share it with other users, making it easier to collaborate and ensure everyone is on the same page. This is especially beneficial in team environments where multiple users may need access to the same data sets or configurations.
You can also update or delete saved views that are no longer needed, helping to keep your workspace organized and clutter-free.

## Manage your saved views

  To create a saved view, follow these steps:

1. Go to a capability that supports Saved views, for example, Catalogs or All Entities, and apply the changes that you want to save as a view using the entity filter bar.

When changes are applied, at the top left of the screen, click **Save view**.

    alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    src="/images/create-saved-views.webp"
/>

3. In the **Saved view name** pop-up screen, enter a name for your saved view and select whether you want to share the saved view with everyone in the account or just for you.

4. Click **Save**.
    After the process is completed, the new Saved view is automatically applied. Also, the new saved view is listed under the **Saved views** capability.

  <Collapser id="load-saved-view" title="Load an existing Saved View">
  Go to the Saved views capability to view the list of saved views or use the **Quick find** (⌘+K or Ctrl+K) to search for the saved view you want to load. You can also load a saved view from the **Saved views** dropdown in the entity filter bar.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="favourite-saved-view" title="Mark a saved view as favourite">
  You can mark a saved view as favourite by clicking the star icon next to the saved view name. This adds the saved view to your **Favourites** list, making it easier to access in the future.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="update-saved-view" title="Update a saved view">
  When modifications are made to the current view, regardless of whether it is a built-in view or a previously loaded Saved view, the Saved view title is displayed in italics. Additionally, a **Save** button appears adjacent to the view title.

  Example:

  The following illustrates a scenario where a "Team" filter has been added to a user-created "My entities" view. Consequently, the italicized "My entities" title indicates the presence of unsaved changes. The Save button located next to the title allows the user to overwrite the existing "My entities" Saved view with these modifications.
  <img
    title="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Overview dashboard"
    src="/images/edit-saved-view.webp"
  />

  By clicking the **Save** button, the view including the new changes are saved into the existing **My entities saved view**, the title will remove its italic font, and the Save button disappears.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="delete-saved-view" title="Delete a saved view">
  To delete a saved view, follow these steps:

1. Load the saved view you want to delete (from the Saved views dropdown or the Saved views capability).
2. Click the hamburger ‘...’ icon next to the saved view name and click **Delete saved view**.
