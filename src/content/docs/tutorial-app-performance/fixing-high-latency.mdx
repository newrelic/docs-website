Diagnosing and resolving performance issues helps your organization attract new users while retaining existing ones. [According to Google's research](https://think.storage.googleapis.com/images/micromoments-guide-to-winning-shift-to-mobile-download.pdf), 29% of mobile users will avoid using a site or an application if it's too slow or too difficult to find information. Of that 29% of users, 70% leave because of site latency. While core web vitals capture how assets behave on your page from a user perspective, they're one part of resolving poor app performance. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial walks you through using New Relic to fix site latency. You'll complete these tasks:

* Understand different types of latency and how your customers experience them.
* Take preventative measures ahead of high latency. 
* Use New Relic to diagnose causes of latency.

## Diagnose latency issues [#diagnostic-steps]

Latency measures how quickly a user receives a response when they make a request. Latency manifests through different page behaviors, so understanding the nuances between these behaviors can help you diagnose the cause and improve your site more efficiently. 

These are the most common causes of high latency:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Slow page load"
    title="Slow page load"
  >
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how quickly a web page renders its largest images, media, or text blocks. When a user experiences a page loading slower than expected, their wait time is measured in LCP. 
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Page non-interactivity"
    title="Page non-interactivity"
  >
  **First input delay** (FID) measures the time taken for specific page elements to respond to user requests. For example, the time a user waits after clicking a button translates into the first input delay on your page. Any clickable element on your page  — a login button, links that take your customers deeper through your conversion funnel, or an important video  — can generate FID metrics. 

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Slow ajax"
    title="Slow AJAX requests"
  >

You can track the health of your AJAX calls with the **AJAX** summary page. This page overviews various problems that exist between a user's browser and an external endpoint. Common problems with AJAX calls include the following:

* Problems across the entire request, which you can track with distributed tracing
* Timing problems, represented by large spikes in the AJAX summary page
* Endpoint problems, which can be tracked by status codes
* Specific webpage location problems, which you can track with session traces.

</Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

Once you understand what causes latency, you can use the **Summary** and **AJAX** pages in <InlinePopover type="browser" /> to start your root cause analysis. In general, we make the following recommendations to optimize your site:

* Use a content delivery network (CDN). CDNs can adjust where content is being served from, or distribute them across differe servers.
* Optimize above-the-fold content.
* Evaluate your web hosting service.
* Minimize JavaScript execution time.
* Use a caching plugin.

## Diagnose high latency [#latency-example]

Let's take a look at a service that is having issues with latency.

<img
  alt="A screenshot of the summary page with a poor LCP score"
  title="Abnormal LCP score"
  src={journeyAbnormalLCP}
/>

From the browser **Summary** page, you notice a service showing a **Largest Contentful Paint** of 8.44 seconds. Since everything else falls under acceptable parameters, you can narrow down the cause of your latency as slow page load. 

* Select **Session trace** page to see a timeline of load and interaction events. This view takes a granular look at an individual session's activity, including page load timing, user interactions, AJAX requests, and errors during a session. 
* Click the **Largest Contentful Paint** link to go to the **Web vitals** page. This gives you a more generalized overview of errors based on page URLs, device type, browser type, and more. 

Looking into a latency issue from different points of view gives you more accuracy when it's time to plan a resolution. Once you've decided the best course of action, you can get your site back to the levels that keep your customers happy.
