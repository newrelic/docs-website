Use New Relic's [metrics API service](/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api) to define rules for creating [metrics](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/metric-data-type) from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. **Recommendation:** Before you begin, review our [requirements and tips for creating rules](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/convert-data-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips).

## Create a metrics rule [#overview-process]

To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans:

1. [Construct the metrics rule using NRQL](#create-nrql).
2. [Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request](#create-request) that contains your NRQL rule.
3. [Create the metric by making the API request](#graphql-api-request).

Once a metric is created, you can [query and chart it using NRQL](#find-your-data).

## Step 1. Create NRQL query rule [#create-nrql]

The most important part of [creating a metrics rule](#overview-process) is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to [10 metrics with a single NRQL query](#multiple-metrics) by following this procedure:

1. [Using New Relic's NRQL interface](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#where), construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example:

   ```
   FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes)
   WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST'
   ```

2. Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types:

   * `summary`: Use if the query's function is `min`, `max`, `sum`, `count`, or `average`.
   * `uniqueCount`: Use if the query's function is `uniqueCount`.
   * `distribution`: Use if the query's function is [`percentile`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-percentile) or [`histogram`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-histogram).

     This example query uses `average`, so use `summary`:

     ```
     FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) 
     WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST'
     ```

     This example query uses `count` on a non-numeric field:

     ```
     FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) 
     WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%'
     ```

     For `summary` on a non-numeric field use `summary(1)`:

     ```
     FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) 
     WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%'
     ```

     <Callout variant="tip">
       For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see [Creating metric rules: requirements and tips](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/convert-data-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips).
     </Callout>

3. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the [limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations](#attributes-limit).

   **Recommendation:** Run a separate query to ensure the maximum cardinality isn't over 50,000 for a 30 second window. For example, the following query will find the maximum cardinality encountered in a 30 second period over the last 3 hours for the `ProcessSample` event when including the `awsRegion`, `awsAvailabilityZone`, and `commandName` attributes:

   ```
FROM (FROM ProcessSample
    SELECT rate(uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName), 30 seconds) AS 'cardinalityRate'
    WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' TIMESERIES 30 seconds) SELECT max(cardinalityRate) AS 'maxCardinalityRate' SINCE 3 hours AGO
   ```

4. To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the `FACET` clause. For example:

   ```
   FROM ProcessSample
   SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' 
   FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName
   ```

5. Set the [name of the metric](#naming) using the `AS` function. For example:

   ```
   FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes'
   WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName
   ```

Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to [create the API request](#create-request).

## Step 2. Create API request [#create-request]

After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can [use our NerdGraph API tool](/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api#use-graphql-api-tool) to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request.

To check that the rule was created correctly, you can [run a query to return that rule using its ID](/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api#list-rule-by-rule-id). For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see [Query and chart your metrics](#find-your-data).

    The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The `IO Total Read Bytes Rule` creates a metric named `io.totalread.bytes`. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the [metric naming rules](#naming).)

    ```
    mutation {
      eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: {
        name: "io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities",
        description:"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.",
        nrql:"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName",
        accountId: 123456
      })
      {
        successes {
          id
          name
          nrql
          enabled
        }
        failures {
          submitted {
            name
            nrql
            accountId        
          }
          errors {
            reason
            description
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    In this request:

## Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request [#graphql-api-request]

When your API request is ready, you can [use the NerdGraph API](/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api#use-graphql-api-tool) to make the request, which will create the metrics.

## Query and chart your metrics [#find-your-data]

After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data:

1. Go to [New Relic's NRQL query interface](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#where).
2. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics:

   ```
   SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric
   ```
3. Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes:

   ```
   SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric'
   ```
4. If you don't see expected data, follow the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) procedures.

The available [NRQL aggregator functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#functions) depend on the [metric type](#summary-and-uniquecount) you created. Here are some examples.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="summary"
    title="Summary metric example"
  >
    If you created a summary metric type, you can use the `count`, `sum`, `max`, `min`, and `average` aggregator functions, as shown in the following query:

    ```
    SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime),  average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="uniqueCount"
    title="Count metric example"
  >
    If you created a `uniqueCount` metric type, you can only use the `uniqueCount` function, as shown in the following query:

    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="distribution"
    title="Distribution metric example"
  >
    If you created a `distribution` metric type, use the `percentile` or `histogram` functions, as shown in the following queries:

    ```
    SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric
    ```

    OR

    ```
    SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this:

```
Cannot parse the unexpected character "\u201C”
```

Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.
