Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans.

## Metric aggregation [#summary-and-uniquecount]

Your NRQL query must use one of the following `summary`, `uniqueCount`, or `distribution` functions to aggregate metrics:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Function
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `summary`
      </td>

      <td>
        Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses [aggregator functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#functions) supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max.

        **Example rule-creation query:**

        ```
        SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction 
        WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `uniqueCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        Creates a `uniqueCount` metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the `uniqueCount` [aggregator type](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#functions).

        Example rule-creation query:

        ```
        FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) 
        AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' 
        WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `distribution`
      </td>

      <td>
        Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses [aggregator functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#functions) such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from `percentile` or `histogram`. The generated metric supports any argument on `percentile` or `histogram`.

        **Example of creating a `distribution` rule:**

        ```
        SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction 
        WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Simple count: `summary(1)` and `sum`
      </td>

      <td>
        If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular `WHERE` clause, use the `summary(1)` metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the `sum` method to see the result.

        **Example:** If you want to create a metric named `foo.count` that counts the transactions named `foo`, the NRQL would look like this:

        ```
        FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo'
        ```

        Then, you would query it like this:

        ```
        FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago
        ```

## Rule-creation limits [#limits]

These limits affect metric rules creation:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Limits
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Account limits
      </td>

      <td>
        An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Metric rule limits
      </td>

      <td>
        A rule can:

        * Create a [maximum of 10 metrics](#multiple-metrics).
        * Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans).
        * Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Time window limits
      </td>

      <td>
        50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window.

        If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an [`NrIntegrationError` event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror) is created in that account that includes:

        * The rule details
        * A message about having too many facets
        * A `newRelicFeature` attribute value of `eventToMetric`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations
      </td>

      <td>
        The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is:

        * Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute
        * Up to a maximum of 10M
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Cardinality limits [#attributes-limit]

[Rule-creation limits](#limits) include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported.

**Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes:**

```
FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) 
WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' 
FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId
```

If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries.

In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is `hostname` and another is `awsRegion`, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values.

This is why it's important, during the [NRQL creation process](#create-nrql), to use the `uniqueCount` function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating.

## Multiple metrics from one rule [#multiple-metrics]

A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule:

* Less likely to reach [rules-per-account limit](#limits).
* Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics.

**Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule:**

```
FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', 
summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' 
WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host
```

## Metric naming [#naming]

A metric is given a name with the `AS` clause, as part of the [NRQL rule-creation process](#create-nrql). In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is `io.totalread.bytes`:

```
FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName
```

If there is no name assigned with the `AS` clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be `ioTotalReadBytes`.

    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Metric names
      </th>

      <th>
        Requirements and recommendations
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Requirements
      </td>

      <td>
        Requirements for naming a metric:

        * Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count.
        * No spaces.
        * Start with a letter.

        Examples of strong metric names:

        * `rubyvm.memory.heap_used`
        * `redis.container.cpu.percent`
        * `memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Length and structure
      </td>

      <td>
        Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric.

        * We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names.
        * Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Components within the name
      </td>

      <td>
        If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right):

        1. Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names.
        2. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots.

        **Example:**

        ```
        application.page_view.duration
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone.

        **Example:** If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Changing metric names
      </td>

      <td>
        If you change a metric name, historical data will **not** be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
