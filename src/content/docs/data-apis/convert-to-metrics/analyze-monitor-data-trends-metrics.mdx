You can generate [metric-type data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics) from other types of data in New Relic, including [events, logs, and spans](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic). Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods.

This document explains:

* [Reasons to use this feature](#feature-description)
* [Available operations](#operations)
* [How to use our NerdGraph API tool](#use-graphql-api-tool) to perform operations

## Why create metrics from other data types? [#feature-description]

Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see [Understand data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types).

* **Events, logs, spans:** These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis.
* **Metrics:** These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month.

To get started converting your data to metrics, [create a rule.](/docs/events-metrics-api-create-metrics)

## Available operations [#operations]

To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading [Intro to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api) and exploring your data with the [GraphiQL API tool](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

These operations fall under two basic [request types](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api#terminology):

* **Mutations**, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule).
* **Queries**, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules).

All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user.

### Mutations

Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="create"
    title="Create a rule"
  >
    See [Create metrics](/docs/events-metrics-api-create-metrics).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete"
    title="Delete a rule"
  >
    <Callout variant="important">
      This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation.
    </Callout>

    To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the [New Relic account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

    **Example request:**

    ```
    mutation {
      eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: "12", accountId: 123456}) {
        successes {
          id
          name
          nrql
        }
        failures {
          errors {
            description
            reason
          }
          submitted {
            ruleId
            accountId
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

            `deletes`
          </td>

          <td>
            This takes two parameters:

            * `ruleId`: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics.
            * `accountId`: The [New Relic account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `successes` and `submitted` blocks
          </td>

          <td>
            Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks:

            * `id` (or `ruleId` for `submitted`)
            * `name`
            * `description`
            * `nrql`
            * `enabled`
            * `accountId`
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    **Example response for the request:**

    ```

        "eventsToMetricsDeleteRule": {
          "failures": [],

            }
          ]

    title="Enable or disable a rule"
  >
    <Callout variant="important">
      This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation.
    </Callout>

    To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same `eventsToMetricsUpdateRule` operation. The only difference is whether `enabled` is set to `true` or `false`.

    **Example request to enable an existing metrics rule:**

    ```
    mutation {
      eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: "12", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) {
        successes {
          id
          name
          nrql
        }
        failures {
          errors {
            description
            reason
          }
          submitted {
            ruleId
            accountId
          }
        }
      }
    }

    If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it.

    **Example listing rule `36` for New Relic account `123456`:**

    ```
    query {
      actor {
        account(id: 123456) {
          eventsToMetrics {
            rulesById(ruleIds:  "36") {
              rules {
                id
                name
                enabled
                nrql
                description
                accountId
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool [#use-graphql-api-tool]

You can use our [GraphiQL tool](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the [operations](#operations) to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool:

1. Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters.
2. Go to **[api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql)**, and paste your query into the box.
3. To execute the operation, press **Play**. Or, to get the cURL format, select **Copy as cURL**.)
4. Validate the response in the response box.
5. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, [run a list query for that rule ID](#list-rule-by-rule-id).
