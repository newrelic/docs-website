metaDescription: 'Send your security data using our security data API.'
---

Send custom vulnerability or security data to New Relic through our security data API through a simple POST request. Use the API if we don't currently support your security service with an integration or if sending security data through an API fits your custom workflow better.

## Prerequisites

- A New Relic <LicenseKey/> for the account you want to report data to.    


## Send data to New Relic [#send-data]

To send vulnerability or other security data, send a JSON object via POST method containing a findings array. Each object in the array describes a detected vulnerability or other security event. 
Make sure to include the security endpoint for New Relic. Use one of the following according to your region:
- For the US, `https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1`
- For EU, `https://security-api.service.eu.newrelic.com/security/v1`

Here's an example POST request. We'll take a look at individual components in the next section:

```
curl -X POST https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1 \
   -H “Content-Type: application/json” \
   -H “Api-Key: <New Relic License Key>” \
   -d '{"findings": [
     {
       "source": "Security Tool Name",
       "title": "Short description of issue",
       "message": "Long form description of the security issue including remediaton advice",
       "issueType": "Library Vulnerability",
       "issueId": "Well-known vulnerability identifier like CVE, CWE, CIS, etc.",
       "issueVendorId": "Vendor-specific identifier if different from issueId",

      <td>
        `issueID`
      </td>
      <td>
        A standard identifier for the detected issue. For example, the CVE or CWE identifier, or the  CIS benchmark rule. If multiple tools detect the same issue, the `issueId` should be the same across all tools.

        `severity`
      </td>
      <td>
