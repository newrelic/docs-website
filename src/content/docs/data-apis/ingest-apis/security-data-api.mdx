---

Send custom vulnerability or security data to New Relic through our security data API through a simple POST request. Use the API if we don't currently support your security service with an integration or if sending security data through an API fits your custom workflow better.

## Prerequisites

* A New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> for the account you want to report data to.

## Send data to New Relic [#send-data]

To send vulnerability or other security data, send a JSON object via POST method containing a findings array. Each object in the array describes a detected vulnerability or other security event.
Make sure to include the security endpoint for New Relic. Use one of the following according to your region:

* For the US, `https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1`
* For EU, `https://security-api.service.eu.newrelic.com/security/v1`

Here's an example POST request. We'll take a look at individual components in the next section:

```shell
curl -X POST https://security-api.newrelic.com/security/v1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Api-Key: INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY " \
  -d '{
    "findings": [
        {
            "source": "Insert security tool name, such as Snyk",
            "title": "Insert a short description of security issue",
            "message": "Insert long description and remediation advice",
            "issueType": "Insert Library|Container|Host Vulnerability",
            "issueId": "Insert vulnerability identifier like CVE, CWE, CIS, etc.",
            "issueVendorId": "Vendor-specific identifier if different from issueId",
            "issueInstanceKey": "Insert the unique path to this instance of the issue",
            "disclosureUrl": "Insert a URL to additional information on the issue",
            "severity": "Insert CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|INFO",
            "remediationExists": Insert boolean true | false (no quotation marks),
            "remediationRecommendation": "Explain the action to take",
            "detectedAt": "Insert timestamp when detected, in milliseconds since epoch",
            "entityType": "Insert Host|Service|Repository|Image|AWS",
            "entityLookupValue": "Insert a URL to find entity",
            "entityGuid": "ABCDEFG",
