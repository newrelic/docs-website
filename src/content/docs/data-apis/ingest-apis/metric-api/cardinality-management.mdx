<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Cardinality refers to the number of unique elements in a set, specifically the unique attribute combinations observed for a given metric within a one-day period. This data resets daily at UTC midnight. As cardinality increases with more unique combinations, it can impact data limits. Understanding and managing cardinality is crucial to optimize data usage and preventing limit issues.

As a New Relic administrator, you oversee data ingestion to ensure it stays within the specified limit. <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> offers graphs and tables to detail your data usage, allowing you to take action if you're approaching your limits.

To view the **<DNT>Cardinality Management</DNT>** UI, go to **<DNT>[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > (click your user name) > <DNT>Administration > Cardinality Management</DNT>**.

## Account cardinality breakdown [#account-breakdown]

If your organization has multiple accounts, you can view a breakdown of cardinality for each account. To switch accounts, use the account picker in the top right corner. If you have access to the account, you can see the account cardinality information on the UI.

### Usage over time [#usage-over-time]

On the landing page of <DNT>**Cardinality Managemen**t</DNT>, you can view the <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart. The chart displays the account cardinality usage compared the limit of that account.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    alt="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_usage-over-time.webp"
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  If the cardinality usage value remains unchanged, then a new data point isn't reported. So, you may see an empty data point. This isn't data loss.
</Callout>

To adjust the timeseries, use the time picker in the top right corner. This change only affects the timeseries in the chart and does't impact the Metrics table following it.
### Metrics table [#metrics-table]
Check the top 20 metrics with the highest cardinality in the selected account for the day. View the breakdown of account cardinality in the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table, organized by metric name.


<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    alt="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metrics-table.webp"
/>

All metrics have a default cardinality limit of 100,000. Based on your requirement, you can [adjust the per-metric limits](#per-metric-limit-adjustment).

## Metric cardinality breakdown [#metric-cardinality-breakdown]

Select any metric in the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table to view its detailed cardinality information in a dedicated <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metric-cardinality-breakdown.webp"
/>

### Bar charts
In the metric-specific view, you can check current cardinality usage with two bar charts:
* <DNT>**Metric cardinality budget**</DNT> (limit): Cardinality usage specific to the metric
* <DNT>**Account cardinality budget**</DNT> (limit): Overall cardinality usage for the account

### Usage over time (for metrics) [#usage-over-time-metrics]

The <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart displays the metric cardinality usage compared the limit of that metric. You can adjust the time picker to view different time periods of this individual metric's cardinality data.

<Callout variant="tip">
    If a metric exceeds its cardinality limit, New Relic still populates information for the metric, but it may be slightly slower as it uses raw data instead of aggregated data.
</Callout>

### Attributes table [#attributes-table]

The <DNT>**Attributes**</DNT> table has the list of top 20 attributes that majorly contribute to the metric's cardinality. To view the values of a specific attribute, click the options menu on the right side of the attribute row and select <DNT>**View attribute values**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="important">
    To use features like **Manage Account Cardinality**, **Manage Metric Cardinality**, and **Create Pruning Rules** within the UI, ensure your role provides the necessary access under the Cardinality Management section in the [Access Management UI's](https://onenr.io/0bRmaX5JgRy) Roles tab. These capabilities can be added through a [custom role](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) or the **All Product Admin role**, with full access automatically granted to **Full Users with the All Product Admin role**.
</Callout>

## Account pruning rules [#account-pruning-rules]

A common method to maintain account cardinality within its limit is to implement pruning rules for non-critical attributes, which removes unnecessary data.

### View account pruning rules [#view-pruning-rules]

To view account pruning rules:
1. Go to the **Cardinality Management** page of the account.
2. From the **Metrics** table, click <DNT>**View Pruning Rules**</DNT>. A scrollable list of all pruning rules associated with the account appears.
  <Callout variant="tip">
If no pruning rules exist in the account, the <DNT>**View Pruning Rules**</DNT> button doesn't appear.
</Callout>

### Create a pruning rule [#create-pruning-rule]

To create a pruning rule:

1. Go to the **Cardinality Management** page of the account.
2. From the **Metrics** table, select the metric in which you want to create a pruning rule. The **Cardinality Management** page of the metric opens.
3. Go to the **Attributes** table and select the attributes you want to prune. 
  <img
    style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing how to select attributes for pruning rule"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to select attributes for pruning rule"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_select-attributes-for-pruning-rule.webp"/>

3. Click <DNT>**Create pruning rule**</DNT>. A pop-up appears, providing details on how the pruning rule impacts the metric's cardinality.
  
  <img
    style={{ align: 'left' }}
    title="Screenshot of page to name the pruning rule"
    alt="Screenshot of page to name the pruning rule"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_name-pruning-rule.webp"/>

3. Enter a rule name or description.
    
4. To create the pruning rule, click <DNT>**Submit**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="important">
Pruning rules take effect immediately. Ensure you want to prune the data before creating a rule. You can delete a pruning rule after creating it, but the rule may prune some data before you remove it.
</Callout>

### Delete a pruning rule [#delete-pruning-rule]

To delete a pruning rule:

1. Go to the **Cardinality Management** page of the account.
2. From the **Metrics** table, select <DNT>**View Pruning Rules**</DNT>.
3. Scroll to the relevant pruning rule and delete it. 

## Per-metric limit adjustment [#per-metric-limit-adjustment]

When all attributes of a specific metric are crucial and you approach your cardinality limit, you can adjust the per-metric limit to meet your needs. Typically, metrics have a default maximum cardinality of 100,000, but you can increase this up to 1 million per metric.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Your account's overall cardinality limit remains unchanged. Therefore, setting all metric limits to 1 million without careful consideration could quickly exhaust your account's cardinality capacity.
</Callout>

### Edit per-metric limit [#edit-per-metric-limit]

1. Go to the specific metric's <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page.
2. Select <DNT>**Adjust metric budget**</DNT>.
3. Update the limit value to meet your needs. Make sure, it is less than or equal to 1 million.

The updated limit appears in the <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page within a few minutes.
