Cardinality refers to the number of unique elements in a set, specifically the unique attribute combinations observed for a given metric within a one-day period. This data resets daily at UTC midnight. As cardinality increases with more unique combinations, it can impact data limits. To understand how cardinality works, refer to the [Understand and query high cardinality metrics](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/NRQL-high-cardinality-metrics/) page.

As a New Relic administrator, you oversee data ingestion to ensure it stays within the specified budget. <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> offers graphs and tables to detail your data usage, allowing you to take action if you're approaching your limits.

To view the **<DNT>Cardinality Management</DNT>** UI, go to **<DNT>[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > (click your user name) > <DNT>Administration > Cardinality Management</DNT>**.

## Monitor account cardinality [#account-breakdown]

If your organization has multiple accounts, you can view a breakdown of cardinality for each account. To switch accounts, use the account picker in the top right corner. If you have access to the account, you can see the account cardinality information on the UI.

### Usage over time [#usage-over-time]

On the landing page of <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT>, you can view the <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart. The chart displays the account cardinality usage compared the budget of that account.

    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    alt="Screenshot showing the usage over time chart"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_usage-over-time.webp"
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  If the cardinality usage value remains unchanged, then a new data point isn't reported. So, you may see an empty data point. This isn't data loss.
</Callout>

To adjust the timeseries, use the time picker in the top right corner. This change only affects the timeseries in the chart and does't impact the Metrics table following it.

### Metrics table [#metrics-table]
Check the top 20 metrics with the highest cardinality in the selected account for the day. View the breakdown of account cardinality in the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table, organized by metric name.

    title="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    alt="Screenshot showing the metrics table"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metrics-table.webp"
/>

All metrics have a default cardinality budget of 100,000. Based on your requirement, you can [adjust the per-metric budgets](#per-metric-limit-adjustment).

## Monitor metric cardinality [#metric-cardinality-breakdown]

Select any metric in the <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> table to view its detailed cardinality information in a dedicated <DNT>**Cardinality Management**</DNT> page.

<img
    style={{ align: 'left',maxWidth: '90%' }}
    title="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    alt="Screenshot showing the Cardinality Management page"
    src="/images/apis-and-data_screenshot-crop_metric-cardinality-breakdown.webp"
/>

### Bar charts
In the metric-specific view, you can check current cardinality usage with two bar charts:
* <DNT>**Metric cardinality budget**</DNT>: Cardinality usage specific to the metric
* <DNT>**Account cardinality budget**</DNT>: Overall cardinality usage for the account

### Usage over time (for metrics) [#usage-over-time-metrics]

The <DNT>**Usage over time**</DNT> chart displays the metric cardinality usage compared the budget of that metric. You can adjust the time picker to view different time periods of this individual metric's cardinality data.

<Callout variant="tip">
    If a metric exceeds its cardinality budget, New Relic still populates information for the metric, but it may be slightly slower as it uses raw data instead of aggregated data.
</Callout>

### Attributes table [#attributes-table]

The <DNT>**Attributes**</DNT> table has the list of top 20 attributes that majorly contribute to the metric's cardinality. To view the values of a specific attribute, click the options menu on the right side of the attribute row and select <DNT>**View attribute values**</DNT>.
