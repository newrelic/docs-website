 As an Authentication Domain Manager, perform the following steps to grant access to a user for managing account and metrics cardinality. Check with the user about their specific needs and accordingly do the configuration. To learn more about user management, refer to [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/).

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Add permissions to a custom role [#permissions-to-custom-role]
    [Create a new custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) with the following permissions, or add them to an existing role. Check with the user to understand the level of access required. 
       * `Manage account cardinality`: Adjust the cardinality budget of the account.
           * `View`: Can see the cardinality budget of the account.
           * `Modify`: Can update the cardinality budget of the account.
       * `Manage metric cardinality`: Adjust the cardinality budget of metrics.
           * `View`: Can see the cardinality budget of the metrics.
           * `Modify`: Can update the cardinality budget of the metrics.
       * `Manage pruning rules`: Manage pruning rules for metrics.
           * `View`: Can see the pruning rules of the metrics.
           * `Modify`: Can create and delete pruning rules for the metrics.
       * `Customer limits management`: Adjust limits of different capabilities in the account including cardinality.
           * `View`: Can see the limits available for the capabilities.
           * `Modify`: Can adjust the limits of the capabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add user, role, and account to a group [#group-access]
    For the cardinality management, [create a new group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#group-access) or manage an existing group as follows:
        1. Navigate to **[New Relic Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal) > Access Management > Groups**.
        2. Click <DNT>**Create a new group**</DNT>, or select <DNT>**Manage group access**</DNT> from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu of an existing group.
        3. For a new group, provide a name and click <DNT>**Create group**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Admin**</DNT> pane for the group opens.
        4. Under <DNT>**Members**</DNT>, add the user.
        5. Under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT>, associate the custom role with the desired account for cardinality management.
        6. If cardinality management involves multiple accounts, under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT>, include the custom role for each relevant account within the group.
  </Step>
