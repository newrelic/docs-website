One of the ways to report custom data to New Relic is with custom events and attributes.

Have questions about why you'd use custom data? See [Introduction to custom data](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/intro-custom-data).

## Requirements [#requirements]

For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see our documentation about [data limits and requirements](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data). 

## Avoid rate limits [#rate-limits]

Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals.

Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data:

* Ensure you follow [limits and requirements](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data) around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size.
* The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your [data retention policy](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-data-retention/event-data-retention-original-pricing-plan).

## Example use cases [#examples]

Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. 

Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. 

### Using custom attributes 

Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. 

Business context might include: 

* Customer token
* Customer market segment
* Customer value classification
* Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem
* User/product/account privilege context


Operational context might include: 

* Which feature flags were used
* What datastore was accessed
* What cache was accessed
* What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning)

### Using custom events 

Event data is one of New Relic's four core [data types](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by "event" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. 

The use cases for custom events vary widely. Basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. For example:  

* An event can represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. 
* An event can record backup activity. For example, you can set up reporting of events that represent production backups of SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration.

## Send custom events and attributes [#ways]

Methods for sending custom events and attributes include:

        Forward [APM agent custom attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes/) to the `PageView` event.
