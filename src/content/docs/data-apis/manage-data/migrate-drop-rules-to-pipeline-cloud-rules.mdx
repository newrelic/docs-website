<Callout variant="important">
As of May 21, 2025, new customers can no longer use NRQL drop rules. [NRQL drop rules will be end-of-life](/eol/2025/05/drop-rule-filter) on January 7, 2026.

Migrate to [Pipeline Control cloud rules](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/cloud-rules-api) to continue managing your data dropping rules.
</Callout>

This guide helps you migrate Terraform-managed drop rules to Pipeline Control cloud rules. You can choose between:
- **GitOps (CI/CD) migration** - Migrate using CI/CD workflows.
- **Local Terraform migration** - Run migration commands on your local machine.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]
- **New Relic Terraform Provider >= v3.68.0** (includes `pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id` support)
- **Terraform >= v1.5** (for import blocks)
- **New Relic API key** with appropriate permissions
- **New Relic CLI** (optional, but recommended for automation)
