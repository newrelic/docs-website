As organizations scale their observability practices, managing data ingestion becomes critical for cost optimization and predictable spending. Data ingest budgets help you shift from reactive to proactive cost management by tracking how much data your organization sends to New Relic, setting spending limits based on gigabytes (GB) ingested, and configuring alert thresholds to prevent unexpected charges.

Building upon the success of Compute Budgets, this feature addresses common challenges:

- **Unpredictable costs**: Forecast your monthly bills despite fluctuating data volumes
- **Limited control**: Set budgets for specific accounts, teams, or applications
- **Budget surprises**: Get proactive alerts before exceeding budget limits, not after the billing cycle
- **Poor visibility**: Track real-time data ingestion against predefined limits
- **Anomaly detection**: Identify and respond to unexpected spikes or drops in data ingestion

## Prerequisites

To use data ingest budgets, you must have:

- A paid data ingest subscription
- A single-tenant organization (not available for multi-tenant organizations)
- The organization manager role to create, edit, or delete budgets

## Who uses data ingest budgets

Data ingest budgets serve different roles within your organization, each with specific responsibilities:

### Organization managers

As an organization manager, you can:

- **Set and allocate budgets**: Define data ingest budgets at organization and account levels
- **Monitor overall usage**: Track total ingestion across the organization and ensure budget adherence
- **Manage budget limits**: Adjust budgets based on actual usage patterns and organizational needs
- **Approve budget requests**: Handle budget increase requests from teams when additional resources are needed
- **Configure notifications**: Set up alerts at multiple threshold levels to provide early warning of budget issues

### Team leads

If you manage a team or department, you can:

- **Monitor team budgets**: Track your team's data ingestion to ensure it stays within allocated limits
- **Request budget adjustments**: Submit requests for budget increases when needed for high-priority tasks or unexpected usage spikes
- **Optimize resource allocation**: Analyze team usage patterns and make decisions to optimize ingestion, such as dropping non-essential data
- **Communicate budget status**: Relay budget warnings to team members and guide them on adjusting workloads based on current budget status

### General users

As a general user working with New Relic, you can:

- **Track project usage**: Monitor data ingestion for projects you're responsible for
- **Respond to warnings**: Take action when budget alerts are triggered, such as optimizing resource usage
- **Request additional budget**: Submit requests for additional resources if you anticipate exceeding your current budget allocation

## Manage organization level data budgets

Organization level data budgets help you track and manage your total data ingestion across your entire organization.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Access data budgets

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration** > **Data Management** > **Data Budgets**.

    <Callout variant="important">
      When you open the **Data Budgets** page, the **Organization Budget** appears by default if you have contract commitments. This budget reflects your data ingestion commitments and updates monthly. It provides a clear overview of how much data (GB) you've ingested and how much remains available.
    </Callout>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you don't have a contract commitment defined, you'll see an empty state with an option to create an organization budget.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Manage budget limits

    In the **Organization Budget** section, click **Manage limits**. The **Edit Organization Budget** page appears.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set monthly budget limits

    1. To update the spending thresholds for your organization, go to the **Set monthly budget limits** section and specify the amount of data (GB) you want to track in your organization budget.

    <Callout variant="important">
      By default, we configure this based on your monthly contract commitments.
    </Callout>

    2. You can increase or decrease the budget amount based on your realistic usage. For example, if you expect to utilize 250 GB in a month, update the value accordingly.
    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, go to the **Set up organization budget notifications** page. Set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the GB assigned to your budget for a specific month, go to the **Thresholds** tab. Select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications (for example, 75%, 90%, or 95%).
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, go to the **Destinations** tab. Add at least one destination to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.

    <Callout variant="important">
      You must add at least one threshold and one destination, or the system will not allow you to create the budget.
    </Callout>

    4. Click **Finish**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your organization budget is now updated and will track your data ingestion usage against the defined limits.

## Manage account level data budgets

Account level data budgets allow you to allocate portions of your organization budget to specific accounts, enabling granular control over data ingestion costs for teams, applications, or business units.

## Best practices

To effectively manage your data ingest budgets:

- **Set realistic limits**: Base your organization budget on historical usage patterns and expected growth to avoid frequent adjustments.
- **Configure multiple thresholds**: Set alerts at different percentages (for example, 75%, 90%, 95%) to give yourself time to respond before hitting limits.
- **Review regularly**: Monitor your budgets monthly to ensure they align with your actual usage and adjust as needed.
- **Use account level budgets**: Allocate budgets to specific accounts to track costs at a granular level and identify high-usage areas or teams.
- **Enable proactive notifications**: Configure email and webhook destinations to ensure the right people are notified when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Analyze usage patterns**: Use the utilization graphs to identify trends, anomalies, or unexpected spikes in data ingestion.
- **Update as needed**: Adjust your budgets when your data ingestion patterns change or when you add new monitoring capabilities.
