Effective cost management is crucial for organizations, and New Relic offers deep visibility into your data ingestion usage. Implementing proactive mechanisms to alert and stay within budget can help manage costs effectively across the organization based on the amount of data (GB) you ingest.

## Prerequisites

To use data ingest budgets, you must meet the following requirements:

- Be a paid customer for GB Ingest
- Have a single-tenant organization (multi-tenant customers cannot access this feature)
- Have the organization manager role to create, edit, or delete budgets

## Manage organization level data budgets

Organization level data budgets help you track and manage your total data ingestion across your entire organization.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Access data budgets

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**. In the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click **Administration** > **Data Management** > **Data Budgets**.

    <Callout variant="important">
      When you open the **Data Budgets** page, the **Organization Budget** appears by default if you have contract commitments. This budget reflects your data ingestion commitments and updates monthly. It provides a clear overview of how much data (GB) you've ingested and how much remains available.
    </Callout>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you don't have a contract commitment defined, you'll see an empty state with an option to create an organization budget.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Manage budget limits

    In the **Organization Budget** section, click **Manage limits**. The **Edit Organization Budget** page appears.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set monthly budget limits

    1. To update the spending thresholds for your organization, go to the **Set monthly budget limits** section and specify the amount of data (GB) you want to track in your organization budget.

    <Callout variant="important">
      By default, we configure this based on your monthly contract commitments.
    </Callout>

    2. You can increase or decrease the budget amount based on your realistic usage. For example, if you expect to utilize 250 GB in a month, update the value accordingly.
    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up notifications

    1. To prevent overages and manage costs effectively, go to the **Set up organization budget notifications** page. Set the threshold percentage and choose the destination for notifications.
    2. To receive a warning when you've used a certain percentage of the GB assigned to your budget for a specific month, go to the **Thresholds** tab. Select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications (for example, 75%, 90%, or 95%).
    3. To ensure notifications are sent when the budget exceeds the threshold, go to the **Destinations** tab. Add at least one destination to be notified. You can choose from the following options:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of New Relic users to notify them about the budget.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.

    <Callout variant="important">
      You must add at least one threshold and one destination, or the system will not allow you to create the budget.
    </Callout>

    4. Click **Finish**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your organization budget is now updated and will track your data ingestion usage against the defined limits.

## Manage account level data budgets

Account level data budgets allow you to allocate portions of your organization budget to specific accounts, enabling granular control over data ingestion costs.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create an account level budget

    1. From the **Data Budgets** page, click **+ Add functional budget**.
    2. The **Create account level budget** page appears.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure budget details

    1. In the **Budget name** field, enter a descriptive name for your budget.
    2. In the **Select accounts** section, choose up to 5 accounts that don't already have budgets assigned.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Accounts that already have budgets will appear disabled in the selection list.
    </Callout>

    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Allocate data budget

    1. On the **Allocate budget** page, you'll see how many GB are remaining in your organization budget.
    2. Enter the amount of GB you want to allocate to this account level budget.
    3. Click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up account level notifications

    1. In the **Thresholds** section, select **+ Add a threshold** and enter the percentage at which you want to receive notifications for this account level budget.
    2. In the **Destinations** section, configure where notifications should be sent:
        - **Email**: Enter the email addresses of users to notify.
        - **Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL to send notifications to a specific endpoint.

    <Callout variant="important">
      You must add at least one threshold and one destination, or the system will not allow you to create the budget.
    </Callout>

    3. Click **Finish**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your account level budget is now created and will appear in the budgets list.

## View and manage existing budgets

Once you've created account level budgets, you can view and manage them from the **Data Budgets** page.

### Budget information displayed

For each account level budget, you'll see:

- **Budget name**: The name you assigned to the budget
- **Status**: Current status of the budget
- **GB allocation**: How much data (GB) has been allocated to this budget
- **GB utilized**: How much of the allocated data has been used
- **Utilization percentage**: Percentage of the budget that has been used

### Manage existing budgets

To manage an existing account level budget:

1. Locate the budget in the list and click the three-dot menu.
2. Choose from the following options:
    - **View details**: See detailed information about the budget, including utilization graphs, thresholds, notification settings, associated accounts, and data sources.
    - **Edit**: Modify the budget allocation, thresholds, or notification settings.
    - **Delete**: Remove the budget (requires organization manager permissions).

### View budget details

When you click on a budget name or select **View details**, you'll see a detailed page showing:

- **Total allocation**: The total GB allocated to this budget
- **Utilization**: How much has been utilized with a visual graph showing usage over time
- **Thresholds**: The notification thresholds you've configured
- **Notification destinations**: Where alerts are sent when thresholds are exceeded
- **Associated accounts**: The accounts included in this budget
- **Data sources**: Information about the data sources contributing to the budget usage

## Best practices

To effectively manage your data ingest budgets:

- **Set realistic limits**: Base your organization budget on historical usage patterns and expected growth.
- **Configure multiple thresholds**: Set alerts at different percentages (for example, 75%, 90%, 95%) to give yourself time to respond before hitting limits.
- **Review regularly**: Monitor your budgets monthly to ensure they align with your actual usage.
- **Use account level budgets**: Allocate budgets to specific accounts to track costs at a granular level and identify high-usage areas.
- **Update as needed**: Adjust your budgets when your data ingestion patterns change or when you add new monitoring capabilities.
