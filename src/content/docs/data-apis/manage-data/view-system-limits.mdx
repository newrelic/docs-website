To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place [limits on the amount of data](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/new-relic-data-usage-limits-policies) you can send, query, and store.

## Limits UI [#limits-ui]

To find the limits UI: from the [account dropdown](/docs/glossary/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **Manage your data** and click **Limits**. 

This UI displays information about how close an account is to hitting rate limits (both data ingest-related limits and query limits), and violations of those limits. The data displayed here is generated from: 

* [Resource use metrics](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#limit-metrics)
* Limit violations reported in [`NrIntegrationError` events](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/nrintegrationerror)

The limits UI displays information related to an account's data ingest rate and query rate, and violations of limits.

What the color-coding in the violation table means: 
* Red: exceeded a limit
* Yellow: 80-100% of a limit
* Green: below 80%
* Gray: limits that exist but that don't have reported usage or violations for the given time range.

Some tips on using the limits UI: 
* To get more detail about a table entry, try clicking it. Some entries have more detail, including associated NRQL queries.   
* When you select a time range greater than 6 hrs, the chart uses average values, which may be smoothed out and not show spikes. For longer ranges, you may see the message "For the time window chosen, the 'Max limit usage' value represents the average of your usage limits." To see more accurate results, use the time picker to zoom into a time range that's less than 6 hours.
* It's possible for the use of a resource to be over a limit while not generating a violation. For example, query limit events are generated for a 1-minute level, but violations are only generated for continually exceeding that limit at the 5-minute level. 

If you want more detail than the UI provides, see [Query your resource use](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits).

## Responses to limit violations [#violations]

Limits are enforced per account (not per organization) and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that's reached. For example:

* We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute.
* For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see [query limits](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries)). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources.
* For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day.

For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an [`NrIntegrationError` event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror) for that account, which has these limit-related attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "210px" }}>
        **Attribute**
      </td>

      <td>
        **Description**
      </td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        category
      </td>

      <td>
        `RateLimit` or `ApiLimit`. The `RateLimit` category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The `ApiLimit` is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record.

## Account-level limits [#all_products]

This table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like [agents and integrations](#other-limits), have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits.

\* NRDB records refers to database records for our [core data types](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types), which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the [New Relic database](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data) (NRDB). This does **not** include [metric timeslice data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data).

## Data ingest API limits

Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general [account-level limits](#all_products). Note that these limits also apply for our tools that use these APIs. 

* [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/metric-api-limits-restricted-attributes) (dimensional metrics)
* [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api)
* [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api)
* [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-general-requirements-limits)

## Finding other agent and integration limits [#other-limits]

To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general [account-level limits](#all_products), see the docs for those tools: you can [search our quickstarts here](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/). Some default reporting limits are located in these tools' configuration docs.
