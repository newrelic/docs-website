Use New Relic's `NrIntegrationError` event to understand problems related to data ingest, limits, and feature configuration.

## Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError [#overview]

Our `NrIntegrationError` event is used to capture issues related to:

* Exceeding of our data ingest limits
* Exceeding of our query limits
* Malformed data
* Configuration issues

You can run NRQL queries to analyze `NrIntegrationError` error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur.

`NrIntegrationError` events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the `newRelicFeature` attribute. Values include:

* `Metrics` indicates an issue with [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/metric-api/introduction-metric-api) ingest.
* `Event API` indicates an issue with [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api) ingest.
* `Logs` indicates an issue with logs ingest.
* `Distributed Tracing` indicates an issue with [distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing) (`Span`) data.
* `Infrastructure` indicates an issue with [infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/)

For attribute definitions, see the [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrIntegrationError).

## Query and alert [#query-alert]

You can query `NrIntegrationError` events using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), and set up [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions) to get notified when issues happen.

Here are some examples of queries:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="simple-query"
    title="Query of Event API issues"
  >
    Here's a simple query of `NrIntegrationError`. This one shows Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results:

    ```
    SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
    ```

    For more detailed queries, see [Example queries](#use-cases).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="simple-query"
    title="Query of Metric API issues"
  >
    Here's a simple query of issues with the Metric API:

    ```
    SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
    ```

    For more detailed queries, see [Example queries](#use-cases).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="limit-query"
    title="Limit-related queries"
  >
    See [Data limits](#limit-related).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="trace-data"
    title="Query of distributed tracing issues"
  >
    Here's a simple query of issues with distributed tracing data:

    ```
    SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
    ```

    For more detailed queries, see [Example queries](#use-cases).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="time-based-query"
    title="Query of issues over time"
  >
    Here's a query showing a count of `NrIntegrationError` events over time:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES
    ```

    For more detailed queries, see [Example queries](#use-cases).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

If you want to examine the structure of this event and see what attributes are attached, you can use a [`keyset()`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#keyset) query, like this:

```
FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT keyset()
```

## Tutorials and examples [#use-cases]

Here are links to docs that go into more detail about how to use `NrIntegrationError`.

### Ingest APIs [#ingest-related]

Below are `NrIntegrationError`-related docs for our core ingest APIs. `NrIntegrationError` events are generated not just for direct use of these APIs but for any New Relic tools that rely on those API endpoints for reporting data:

* Metric API: see [Troubleshoot Metric API ingest](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events)
* Event API: see [parsing errors](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/#errors-parsing) and [tips for troubleshooting event reporting](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/#nrIntegration).
* Log API: See [No log data appears](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui).
* Trace API: see [Response validation](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-general-requirements-limits/#response-validation) and [Troubleshoot missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/troubleshooting-missing-trace-api-data).

### Data limits [#limit-related]

Limit-related docs:

* [View the limits UI](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/view-system-limits) (`NrIntegrationError` is used to create these charts)
* [Limit-related query examples](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/query-limits)

### Specific agents and integrations [#agent-related]

* APM agent: [Config mismatch](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/agent-nrintegrationerrors-appear-insights)
* [StatsD](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/statsd-monitoring-integration-version-2)
* Prometheus: [OpenMetrics errors](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/rate-limit-errors-prometheus-integration) \| [Remote write errors](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/remote-write-errors-error-messages)

## Programmatically use NrIntegrationError events [#use-api]

If you're interested in manipulating these events via API, see [Programmatically use NrIntegrationError](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events/#programmatically-retrieve-nrintegrationerror-events).

## Understand changes to your account [#audit-events]

If you're trying to understand changes that have been made in your New Relic account (like when a user made a change), see [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/event-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).
