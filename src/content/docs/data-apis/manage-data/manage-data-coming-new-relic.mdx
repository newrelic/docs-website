You may want to manage your New Relic data ingest for several reasons, including:

* Removing unwanted data
* Managing [data ingest costs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing)

## Data ingest UI [#ui]

The <DNT>**Data ingestion**</DNT> tab is located in the [Data management UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data). The data ingestion UI shows a summary of your usage by data source. For organizations with multiple accounts, you can also view the usage of specific accounts.

<figcaption>
  From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select <DNT>**Manage your data**</DNT>.
</figcaption>

For detailed definitions of the metrics shown in the chart, see [Data ingest sources](#sources-list).

To see the underlying NRQL query used to create that chart, click <DNT>**View NRQL**</DNT>.

For a video showing a brief tour of this and other administration UIs, see [Account settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings/#video-tour).

### Get more detail [#detail]

To get more detail about a specific data source shown in the chart, hover over the band in the chart and click it. A modal will open up, as shown in the image below.

For some technical details about how the chart displays data and error messages, see [Chart details](#technical-details-chart).

## Estimate future data ingest [#estimate]

If you're trying to estimate future data ingest, see this [blog post on estimating ingest](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost).

## Manage ingest and avoid ingest spikes [#manage]

How you manage your New Relic data will depend on a lot of factors specific to your organization and your needs. That said, here are some general tips for managing data ingest and avoiding unexpected spikes:

* <DNT>**Assign team members.**</DNT> Assign team members who'll be in charge of reviewing your ingest on a cadence, and managing it. Ensure they understand the [data-related billing factors](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing), including what does and doesn't count towards billing.
* <DNT>**Get to know your data.**</DNT> Spend some time getting acquainted with your data. Get to know its ebbs and flows, and understand where it's coming from.
* <DNT>**Monitor when you make significant changes.**</DNT> When you first activate a new data-reporting tool, or when you upgrade an agent or integration, or when you make any big change in your system, you should monitor your ingest to ensure there's no unexpected spike in data.
* <DNT>**Set up alerts.**</DNT> If you're concerned about specific scenarios causing sudden spikes in data, set up an alert condition to notify you if that occurs. For tips on that, see [Usage queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

### Reducing ingest [#adjust-ingest]

Below are some tips for common approaches New Relic customers take to reduce the ingest of data that's not helpful to them.

All New Relic solutions have various configuration options that give you control over how data is reported to New Relic. Below we have some popular methods for reducing data ingest, but to learn about all the options available, we recommend reading the docs for specific tools you're using.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="adjust-apm-ingest"
    title="Manage APM ingest"
  >
    Options for adjusting <InlinePopover type="apm"/> data include:

    * Configure the sampling rate for transaction events. See agent configurations for [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Transaction_Events), [.Net](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration), [Go](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration#transaction-events-settings), [NodeJS](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration), [PHP](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration), [Python](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration), or [Ruby](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration).
    * Adjust [distributed trace sampling](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works)
    * Optimize [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation) and/or [custom metrics](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics).
    * Manage [logs-in-context](/docs/logs/logs-context/get-started-logs-context).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="adjust-infra-ingest"
    title="Manage infrastructure ingest"
  >
    Options for adjusting infrastructure data include:

    * Adjust [sampling rate](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#samples-variables) for network, storage, and system events.
    * [Disable process metrics](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#enable-process-metrics).
    * Adjust polling intervals:
      * For cloud integrations: [Adjust polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).
      * For [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations): adjust an integration's configuration.
    * [Control the reporting of specific attributes](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#include-matching-metrics).
    * Manage [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration/#install).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="adjust-log-ingest"
    title="Manage log ingest"
  >
    Options for adjusting log data ingest include:

    * [Automatic logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging): Disable or enable via the UI or API, or adjust client-side configuration settings.
    * [Log data forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic): Unfiltered logs can sometimes result in a large amount of log data being reported. You can adjust the log forwarder configuration to filter log events from the log-sending side.
    * [Drop log data](/docs/logs/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules): Manage data ingest via the UI or API.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="drop-data"
    title="Drop data"
  >
    On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. But you can also set your own [data dropping rules](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/drop-data-using-nerdgraph).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="npm"
    title="Manage network monitoring data"
  >
    For unexpected increases in [network monitoring data](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/get-started/npm-introduction), you may consider adjusting the polling interval.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="disable"
    title="Disable or remove monitoring tools"
  >
    If you have agents or integrations that you don't want at all, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific docs for that tool. Keep in mind that if you think there's a chance you might use that tool in the future, simply disabling it might be a better solution than uninstalling it completely.

## Data ingestion sources [#sources-list]

The [data ingestion UI](#data-ingest-ui) chart shows you a high level breakdown of your billable data usage. The table below explains those sources. In this table, "usage metric group" refers to the value of that source's `usageMetric` attribute value on the `NrConsumption` event.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="metrics"
    title="Metrics"
  >
    In the data ingestion chart, <DNT>**Metrics**</DNT> is a combination of two types of metrics: [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data) and [dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).

    Usage metric group: `MetricsBytes`.

    Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days.

    You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm"
    title="APM events"
  >
    This includes [APM events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-events-insights), like `Transaction` and `TransactionError`.

    Usage metric group: `ApmEventsBytes`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="infra"
    title="Infrastructure"
  >
    There are several types of [infrastructure monitoring-related data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events).

    ### Infrastructure hosts

    This data is reported via the `SystemSample`, `NetworkSample`, and `StorageSample` events.

    The usage metric group is `InfraHostBytes`.

    Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data.

    ### Infrastructure processes

    This data is stored in the `ProcessSample` event.

    The usage metric group is `InfraProcessBytes`.

    Data related to each process running on the hosts running the infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. For more information, see [Process metrics](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#enable-process-metrics).

    ### Infrastructure integrations

    Usage metric group: `InfraIntegrationBytes`.

    Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="logging"
    title="Logging"
  >
    Includes logs and any `Log_<value>` custom data partition that exists.

    The usage metric group is `LoggingBytes`.

    Log records are stored on the [`Log` data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#log-data) by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new data types, which are always prefixed with `Log_` and are counted as part of the overall set of log data stored.

    With `LogExtendedRecord`, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. For more on how this data is stored, see [our log blobs docs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/long-logs-blobs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-events"
    title="Custom events"
  >
    This data is from your [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data).

    The usage metric group is `CustomEventsBytes`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobile"
    title="Mobile events"
  >
    [Mobile events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-default-events-insights), including the general `Mobile` event, `MobileRequestError`, `MobileBreadcrumb`, `MobileSession`, `MobileHandledException`, `MobileCrash`, `MobileRequest`, and `MobileJavaScriptError`.

    Usage metric group: `MobileEventsBytes`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tracing"
    title="Tracing"
  >
    This includes the [`Span` data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#trace-data) and OpenTelemetry's `SpanEvent`.

    The usage metric group is `TracingBytes`.

    `DistributedTraceSummary` events do not count towards ingest.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="browser"
    title="Browser events"
  >
    These are [<InlinePopover type="browser"/> events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/browser-default-events-insights), including the namespaces of `Browser`, `Browser:EventLog`, `Browser:JSErrors`, and `PcvPerf` (PageView timing).

    The usage metric group is `BrowserEventsBytes`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="lambda"
    title="Lambda"
  >
    These are [AWS Lambda events](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/ui-data/understand-lambda-data-structure).

    The usage metric group is `ServerlessBytes`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="change-tracking-ingest"
    title="Change tracking"
  >
    Change tracking activity is stored in the <DNT>**Deployment**</DNT> namespace. Individual changes you track average around 200 to 250 bytes toward your ingest.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="security-bytes-ingest"
    title="Security"
  >
    Events reported by the security features of New Relic are stored in the <DNT>**Security**</DNT> namespace. These are primarily vulnerability reports provided by the Vulnerability Management feature, but may be expanded to include additional products in the future.

    Expected event volumes of this type are very low, as the occurrence of vulnerability reports are rare.

    Security features still in public preview use a separate <DNT>**Security:Preview**</DNT> namespace and are not billable.

    The usage metric group is `SecurityBytes`.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Optimize your data ingest [#optimize-ingest]

We also have an [in-depth tutorial on how to optimize data ingest](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/intro-data-governance).

## Stream ingested data [#stream]

For more about streaming ingested data to other sources, see [Streaming export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export).

## Data from multiple data center regions [#data-centers]

If you have accounts in multiple data center regions, [learn more about how to understand your usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center#account-structure).

## Technical details about the ingestion chart [#technical-details-chart]

Some technical details about the ingest UI:

* <DNT>**Displays are estimates.**</DNT> The ingest value shown on the ingest chart can vary slightly from the actual amount you may see when running your own query. This is because the calculation used for the chart is an estimate.
* <DNT>**No chart data available.**</DNT> The data ingestion chart can display a slightly longer time frame than that covered by your data retention settings. For this reason, you may get message that there's no chart data available.
* <DNT>**Chart time buckets.**</DNT> If an account has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the volume over a 24-hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1-hour period.
