To find the data retention UI: from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), click <DNT>**Manage your data**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Data retention**</DNT>.

On the <DNT>**Data retention**</DNT> UI [page](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/limits-data-retention/data-retention), you can review and manage how long different types of data are stored. You may want shorter retention for some data types in order to protect sensitive information, or you may want longer retention (up to seven years) to be able to see and analyze data and trends over a longer period.

To learn about plans and costs for changing retention, refer to [Data options: Data Plus and original](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#upgrade-data-plus).

## Extend your data retention for long-term analysis and compliance

Extending your data retention allows you to do long-term analysis, visualization, and alerting for all your metrics, events, logs, and traces across all of your sources. However, it's important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. Our data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what's stored and for how long.

<Callout variant="tip">
  With [our Data Plus option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus), you get up to an additional 90 days of retention (for most data types) and other enterprise-grade capabilities, such as longer query durations, FedRAMP and HIPAA compliance, additional security features, and more.

  The <DNT>**Data retention**</DNT> UI is where you can view and edit your effective retention values, as well as upgrade your retention plan. To view explanations of the table column headers, hover over each header in the UI, or see our explanations in the **Requirements** section below.
</figcaption>

## Requirements [#requirements]

The way users manage data retention may depend on how many accounts you have in your organization and what they are trying to do.

### Single-account organizations [#single-account-organizations]

If you are in an organization that has only one account in it, your [**Billing User**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/) can manage the following:

* **Max per contract:** This is the highest value you can set for the **Effective retention** of a data type. If you would like to increase this, see our [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-prices) plan.
* **Effective retention:** This is the amount of time data is currently retained for a data type.  For the user to be able to edit this, the organization (account) needs to be on [Standard or a higher edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#how-pricing-works).

If your Billing User can't perform either of these two tasks, contact support or your New Relic representative.

### Multiple-account organizations [#multiple-account-organizations]

If you're in an organization that has more than one account in it, users can manage the following:

* **Max per contract:** This is the highest value you can set for the **Effective retention** of a data type. If you would like to increase this, see our [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-prices) plan.
* **Effective retention:** This is the amount of time data is currently retained for a data type. For the user to be able to edit this:
  * The organization (account) needs to be on [Pro or a higher edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#how-pricing-works).
  * The user type needs to be **Full platform**.
  * The user would need **View** and **Modify** permissions for the [**Insights event retention**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#data-retention) feature that [points to the account(s)](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/) they need to edit **Effective retention** for.

If your user can't perform either of these two tasks after referencing the above details, contact support or your New Relic representative.

## Default retention periods [#retention-periods]

The best way to understand your New Relic data retention is to go to the <DNT>**Data retention**</DNT> UI page. We recommend this because your organization may have edited your settings and so they might not be the default settings shown below.

This table shows the default [namespace](/docs/glossary/glossary) retention settings.

## Retention details for assorted data types [#data-details]

In this section are details about a few different types of data, including some data types that have retention settings that can't be changed.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="dimensional-metrics"
    title="Dimensional metrics (Metric API)"
  >
    Raw [dimensional metric](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) data (the `Metric` data type) is aggregated (rolled up) for a few different time ranges and those aggregations are retained for different lengths of time. The raw dimensional metric data points are stored for 30 days. Any aggregated data points (aggregation starts at one-minute) are retained for 13 months.

    Only the raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

    Metric retention periods are not editable.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metric-timeslice"
    title="Metric timeslice data (APM, browser, mobile)"
  >
    [Metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) is generated by <InlinePopover type="apm"/> (both custom metrics and default metrics), <InlinePopover type="mobile"/>, and browser agents. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the "timeslice"), and a numeric value (the measurement). APM, <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, and mobile agents can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics, such as error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time.

    Metric timeslice data is aggregated like this:

    * first to 1-minute rollups that are stored for 8 days
    * the 1-minute rollups are also added to 1-hour roll-ups that are retained for 90 days

      Only the initial raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

      Some key metrics are stored indefinitely. Read on to learn the key metrics by product.

      Here are key metric timeslice data that is stored indefinitely:

    Infrastructure monitoring downsamples your data as it's generated. Only the 4x main infrastructure monitoring metric data types (`SystemSample`, `StorageSample`, `NetworkSample` and `ProcessSample`) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the infrastructure UI and for queries:

## Edit data retention [#adjust-retention]

To view and edit your retention, go to [data retention view](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/limits-data-retention/data-retention), and click <DNT>**Edit data retention**</DNT>. There you'll see options for editing data retention or upgrading to Data Plus. If you don't see that, review [the requirements](#requirements) and talk to your New Relic account representative.

Options for increasing retention:

* If you haven't already, switch to [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus), which offers significantly longer data retention and other benefits.
* For Data Plus or original data option: add data retention. 30 days of additional data retention for your organization costs $0.05 per GB ingested per month.

Important points about increasing retention:

* When you enable a higher retention period, retention is increased across the board for all data types listed in the [<DNT>**Data retention**</DNT> UI](#find-ui). It cannot be increased only for specific data types.
* Once you enable a higher retention period, reducing retention for specific data sources has no impact on your billing. To learn about ways to reduce your data ingest and billing, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).
* When you adjust retention, it can take up to 24 hours to take effect.

### Reducing retention [#reduce-retention]

When you reduce the retention period for a data source, existing data of that type won't immediately disappear. That data might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly [removing data](#deleting-data).

To learn about options for reducing data ingest, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## Delete existing data [#deleting-data]

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) is reported to the New Relic database and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention period](#adjust-retention) ends. If you want to delete data that has already been reported, contact your New Relic representative, if you have one.

## Export and stream data [#export-data]

Organizations with Data Plus can export their data for long-term storage using their preferred tools. Features related to this include:

* [Streaming data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export)
* [Historical data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export)

## Manage retention via API [#api-examples]

In addition to changing your retention settings in the UI, you can use our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). Some example NerdGraph requests are included below. Note that your data retention changes may take up to 24 hours to take effect.

Before using the API to adjust retention, review [the rules on adjusting retention](#adjust-retention).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="api-list-namespaces"
    title="List customizable retention event namespaces"

    To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account:

    ```graphql
    query {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         dataManagement {
           customizableRetention {
             eventNamespaces {
               namespace
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-list-rules"
    title="List active rules on an account"

    To list active rules on an account:

    ```graphql
    query {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         dataManagement {
           eventRetentionRules {
             id
             deletedAt
             deletedById
             createdAt
             createdById
             retentionInDays
             namespace
           }
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-show-active-rule"
    title="Show active rule on an account/namespace pair"
  >
    To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair:

    ```graphql
    query {
     actor {
       account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         dataManagement {
           eventRetentionRule(namespace: "APM") {
             id
             deletedById
             deletedAt
             createdById
             createdAt
             retentionInDays
             namespace
           }
         }
       }
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-create-new-rule"
    title="Create a new rule"
  >
    To create a new rule:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
     dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: "APM", retentionInDays: 8) {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Delete an existing rule"
  >
    If you delete a rule applied to a child account, that child account will adopt the current retention value of its parent account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a parent account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
     dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: "APM") {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Copy existing child account rules to others"
  >
    You can specify a child account to be the template or source account, and have other destination child accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source child account. Note: all child accounts must be within the same parent account. To copy an existing set of retentions:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      dataManagementCopyRetentions(
        sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID,
        destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3])
      {
        success
        failure
      }
    }
    ```

    Success and failure will return lists of destination account IDs that were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

## Account inheritance [#account-structure]

The data retention settings of a [parent account](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure) are inherited by its children accounts. In this context, a New Relic organization's first account is considered the parent account, and other accounts added to the organization inherit the settings in that account.
