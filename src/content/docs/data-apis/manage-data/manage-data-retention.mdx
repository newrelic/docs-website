Using the **Data retention** UI page, review and manage how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). Keep data for shorter periods to protect sensitive information or for longer periods to notice trends over time. At a glance, get the sources of data that youâ€™re storing, when they were last updated, and the length the data is stored. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data source and the [namespace](/docs/glossary/glossary/#namespace).

  From the data retention UI page, which shows the source of data, you can click **Edit settings** to adjust the data retention for each source.

## Metrics and infrastructure data [#data-details]

Here are some details about how metrics and infrastructure data are stored and retained: 

<CollapserGroup>


  <Collapser
    id="dimensional-metrics"
    title="Dimensional metrics (Metric API)"
  >

Raw [dimensional metric](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) data (the `Metric` data type) is aggregated (rolled up) for a few different time ranges and those aggregations are retained for different lengths of time. The raw dimensional metric data points are stored for 30 days. Any aggregated data points (aggregation starts at one-minute) are retained for 13 months.

Only the raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

Metric retention periods are not editable.
</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metric-timeslice"
    title="Metric timeslice data (APM, browser, mobile)"
  >

[Metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) is generated by APM (both custom metrics and default metrics), mobile, and browser agents. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the "timeslice"), and a numeric value (the measurement). APM, browser, and mobile agents can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics, such as error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. 

Metric timeslice data is aggregated like this:
* first to 1-minute rollups that are stored for 8 days
* the 1-minute rollups are also added to 1-hour roll-ups that are retained for 90 days

Only the initial raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

Some key metrics are stored indefinitely. Read on to learn the key metrics by product.

Here are key metric timeslice data that is stored indefinitely:

      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

Infrastructure monitoring downsamples your data as it's generated. All infrastructure monitoring metric data types (including metrics from on-host integrations) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the infrastructure UI and for queries:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            **Bucket size**

## Edit retention values [#adjust-retention]

We let you adjust the retention periods for some types of data. For example, you might reduce your retention values for your APM data to optimize the performance of your querying of that data. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types so that you can do more granular analysis over longer time ranges, or to meet data compliance requirements. 

For each additional month (30 days) of retention, the cost is $0.05 per GB ingested per month.

### Requirements for editing retention [#requirements]

[Pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models)-related requirements: 

* New Relic One pricing model: requires Pro or Enterprise edition to edit retention. 
* Original pricing model: requires Insights Pro to edit retention.  

The ability to edit data retention is impacted by which user model a user is on:
* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): requires the [**Billing user** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles).
* The [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model): requires role of Owner, Admin, or the [**Data retention manager** add-on role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#add-on). 

### Reduce retention values [#reduce-retention]

When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear. That data might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly [removing data](#data-deletion).

That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration. 

Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce any New Relic data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges.

### Copy retention values

If you have multiple accounts in your organization, you can also copy retention values from one account to other accounts. To do this, select the **Copy settings to other accounts** link, and then select the accounts you want to apply the retention values to.

![image of child accounts to copy retention values to](./images/copy-data-retention.png "Copy retention values")

<figcaption>
  Select the accounts you want to copy retention values to.
</figcaption>

## Deleting data [#deleting-data]

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention period](#adjust-retention) ends. If you need to delete data that has already been reported, contact your New Relic representative.

## Manage retention via API [#api-examples]

You can change your retention settings with [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) as well as the UI. For the following examples, provide any necessary information, and run the code in the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).  

Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating.

     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Delete an existing rule"
  >
    If you delete a rule applied to a child account, that child account will adopt the current retention value of its parent account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a parent account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule:

    ```
    mutation {
     dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, namespace: "APM") {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Copy existing child account rules to others"
  >
    You can specify a child account to be the template or source account, and have other destination child accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source child account. Note: all child accounts must be within the same parent account. To copy an existing set of retentions:

    ```
    mutation {
      dataManagementCopyRetentions(
        sourceAccountId: <var>SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID</var>,
        destinationAccountIds: [<var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3</var>])
      {
        success
        failure
      }
    }
    ```

    Success and failure will return lists of destination account IDs that were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.
  </Collapser>

## Account inheritance [#account-structure]

The data retention settings of a [parent account](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure) are inherited by its children accounts. In this context, an organization's first account is treated as the parent account, and other accounts added to the organization inherit the settings in that account. You also have the option to override those settings and set account-specific data retention settings.
