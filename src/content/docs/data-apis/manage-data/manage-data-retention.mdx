With New Relic's **Data retention** UI page, you can review and manage how long different types of data are stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). Keep data for shorter periods to protect sensitive information and return queries faster, or keep it for longer periods to be able to see and analyze data and trends over a longer period.

## Requirements [#requirements]

This doc applies for organizations on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models). For data retention for our original pricing model, see [Original data retention](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-based-pricing/overview-data-retention-components). 

The ability to edit data retention requires Pro or Enterprise edition. 

Permission-related requirements:
* [Newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models): requires the [**Billing** administration setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#admin-settings).
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model): requires the **Insights event retention** capability, which the **Admin**, **Owner**, and **Data retention add-on manager** have. 

## Find the data retention UI [#find-ui]

The **Data retention** UI page is located in the [Data management hub](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data).

## Default retention periods [#retention-periods]

The best way to understand your New Relic data retention is to go to the **Data retention** UI page. One reason this is recommended is because your organization may have edited your settings and they may no longer be the default settings documented here. 

This table shows the default [namespace](/docs/glossary/glossary) retention settings for organizations on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).

## Retention details for assorted data types [#data-details]

In this section are details about a few different types of data, including some data types that have retention settings that can't be changed. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="dimensional-metrics"
    title="Dimensional metrics (Metric API)"
  >
Raw [dimensional metric](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) data (the `Metric` data type) is aggregated (rolled up) for a few different time ranges and those aggregations are retained for different lengths of time. The raw dimensional metric data points are stored for 30 days. Any aggregated data points (aggregation starts at one-minute) are retained for 13 months.

Only the raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

Metric retention periods are not editable.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metric-timeslice"
    title="Metric timeslice data (APM, browser, mobile)"
  >
    [Metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) is generated by APM (both custom metrics and default metrics), mobile, and browser agents. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the "timeslice"), and a numeric value (the measurement). APM, browser, and mobile agents can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics, such as error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time.

    Metric timeslice data is aggregated like this:
    * first to 1-minute rollups that are stored for 8 days
    * the 1-minute rollups are also added to 1-hour roll-ups that are retained for 90 days

    Only the initial raw data ingest counts towards usage: the aggregated data does not.

    Some key metrics are stored indefinitely. Read on to learn the key metrics by product.

    Here are key metric timeslice data that is stored indefinitely:

    Infrastructure monitoring downsamples your data as it's generated.

## Edit retention values [#adjust-retention]

If you meet [the requirements](#requirements), you can increase the retention periods for some types of data. For example, you might reduce your retention values for your APM data to optimize the performance of your querying of that data. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types so that you can do more granular analysis over longer time ranges, or to meet data compliance requirements.

For each additional 30 days of retention that is added to a namespace's [default retention period](#retention-periods), the cost is $0.05 per GB ingested per month. 

### Reduce retention values [#reduce-retention]

When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear. That data might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly [removing data](#data-deletion).

That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration.

Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce any New Relic data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges.

### Copy retention values

If you have multiple accounts in your organization, you can also copy retention values from one account to other accounts. To do this, select the **Copy settings to other accounts** link, and then select the accounts you want to apply the retention values to.

<img
  title="Copy retention values"
  alt="image of child accounts to copy retention values to"
  src={copyDataRetention}
/>

<figcaption>
  Select the accounts you want to copy retention values to.
</figcaption>

## Deleting data [#deleting-data]

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention period](#adjust-retention) ends. If you need to delete data that has already been reported, contact your New Relic representative.

## Manage retention via API [#api-examples]

In addition to changing your retention settings in the UI, you can use our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). Some example NerdGraph requests are included below. Note that your data retention changes take effect within 24 hours after an update.

    To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair:

    ```
    query {
     actor {
       account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
         dataManagement {
           eventRetentionRule(namespace: "APM") {

  <Collapser
    id="api-create-new-rule"
    title="Create a new rule"

    To create a new rule:

    ```
    mutation {
     dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, namespace: "APM", retentionInDays: 8) {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Delete an existing rule"

    If you delete a rule applied to a child account, that child account will adopt the current retention value of its parent account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a parent account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule:

    ```
    mutation {
     dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, namespace: "APM") {
       id
       deletedById
       deletedAt
       createdById
       createdAt
       retentionInDays
       namespace
     }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-delete-rule"
    title="Copy existing child account rules to others"
  >
    You can specify a child account to be the template or source account, and have other destination child accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source child account. Note: all child accounts must be within the same parent account. To copy an existing set of retentions:

    ```
    mutation {
      dataManagementCopyRetentions(
        sourceAccountId: <var>SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID</var>,
        destinationAccountIds: [<var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2</var>, <var>DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3</var>])
      {
        success
        failure
      }
    }
    ```

    Success and failure will return lists of destination account IDs that were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

## Account inheritance [#account-structure]

The data retention settings of a [parent account](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure) are inherited by its children accounts. In this context, an organization's first account is treated as the parent account, and other accounts added to the organization inherit the settings in that account. You also have the option to override those settings and set account-specific data retention settings.
