[Synthetic monitoring in New Relic](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) reports [event data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) that is displayed in some UI displays and is also available for [querying and charting](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Event
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td id="syntheticcheck-error">
        [`SyntheticCheck`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=SyntheticCheck)
      </td>

      <td>
        `SyntheticCheck` returns metrics from one run of a specific monitor. These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp.

        Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in the`SyntheticCheck` event type. `SyntheticCheck` events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="syntheticrequest">
        [`SyntheticRequest`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=SyntheticRequest)
      </td>

      <td>
        `SyntheticRequest` returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information.

        With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the `SyntheticCheck` event type.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [`SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus)
      </td>

      <td>
        Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a `SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus` event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="synthetic-private-minion">
        [`SyntheticPrivateMinion`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=SyntheticsPrivateMinion)
      </td>

      <td>
        If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the `SyntheticPrivateMinion` event.

        Each private minion running sends health details to `SyntheticPrivateMinion` every 30 seconds. This allows you to understand the health of the private minion running at the location.
