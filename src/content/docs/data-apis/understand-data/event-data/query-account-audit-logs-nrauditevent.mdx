As an additional security measure for managing your New Relic account, you can use the `NrAuditEvent` event to view audit logs that show changes in your New Relic account. This includes:

* Individuals added or deleted
* Role changes
* Account changes made via API
* [Synthetic monitor changes](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/audit-synthetics-account-changes)
* Dashboard deletion
* Workload configuration changes

You can also use [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerting-new-relic) to be notified about changes in your New Relic account.

## Account data security and retention [#retention]

All New Relic accounts can query up to 13 months of account changes. To ensure account security, the audit logging [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) query only tracks changes in your currently selected account. It does not show audit log events for any associated child accounts. To query changes in another account or sub-account, select the account and run a NRQL query there.

Audit logging is different than configuring [audit mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/log-audit-all-data-your-new-relic-agent-transmits) for your APM agent. APM audit mode records information about all data being transmitted from your app.

## Run NrAuditEvent query [#nrql]

To track and view changes in your New Relic account:

1. At any [NRQL interface](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#where), run the following query, adjusting the time frame as needed up to thirteen months:

   ```
   SELECT * from NrAuditEvent SINCE 1 day ago
   ```
2. To customize your query, use any of the available [`NrAuditEvent` attributes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAuditEvent).
3. To be notified about account changes, create [NRQL conditions with alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).

To query changes in another account, select the account and run a separate NRQL query for that account.
