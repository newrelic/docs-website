To view changes made in your New Relic account, you can query [`NrAuditEvent` events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent).

## Available events and attributes [#attributes]

The `NrAuditEvent` is created to record some important types of configuration changes made in New Relic. The data gathered for this event includes the type of account change, actor (user or API key) that made the change, a human-readable description of the action taken, and a timestamp for the change.

To see all the attributes attached to this event, see [`NrAuditEvent`.](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAuditEvent)

## Example queries [#default-attributes]

These examples show some of the ways you can run [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-since) queries of the `NrAuditEvent` event.

### General account changes [#examples-any]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="all-changes"
    title="What changes have been made to the New Relic account?"
  >
    To view all changes to your New Relic account for a specific time frame, run this basic NRQL query:

    ```
    SELECT * from NrAuditEvent SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="what-changed"
    title="What type of account change was made the most?"
  >
    To query what type of change to the account users was made the most frequently during a specific time frame, include the [`actionIdentifier` attribute](#actorIdentifier) in your query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) AS Actions FROM NrAuditEvent 
    FACET actionIdentifier SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="accounts-created"
    title="What accounts were added to our organization?"
  >
    To query for information about created accounts and who created them, you can use something like:

    ```
    SELECT actorEmail, actorId, targetId FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'account.create' SINCE 1 month ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="graph-changes"
    title="What trends appear in account changes?"
  >
    When you include `TIMESERIES` in a NRQL query, the results are shown as a line graph. For example:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) from NrAuditEvent TIMESERIES facet actionIdentifier since 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="user-mgmt"
    title="What user management changes have been done?"
  >
    Note that your users' [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) will impact these queries. If your users are on our original user model, you can only query per account. If your users are on the New Relic One user model, you should query the top-level account in your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure).

    To see all the changes made to users, you could use:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' 
      SINCE this month
    ```

    If you wanted to narrow that down to see changes to [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), you could use:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' 
      AND actionIdentifier IN ('user.self_upgrade', 'user.change_type') 
      SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="synth-changes"
    title="Synthetic monitoring: What changes have been made to a monitor?"
  >
    To query updates for your synthetic monitors during a specific time frame, include the [`actionIdentifier`](/attribute-dictionary/nrauditevent/actionidentifier) attribute in your query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent 
    WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' 
    FACET actionIdentifier, description, actorEmail 
    SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000
    ```

    For more information about this synthetic monitoring feature, see [synthetic monitoring audit log](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/audit-synthetics-account-changes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="workload-changes"
    title="Workloads: What changes were made to any workload configuration?"
  >
    To query what configuration changes were made to any workload, use the query below. The `targetId` attribute contains the GUID of the workload that was modified, which you can use for searches. Since changes on workloads are often automated, you might want to include the `actorType` attribute to know if the change was done directly by a user through the UI or through the API.

    ```
    SELECT timestamp, actorEmail, actorType, description, targetId 
    FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'workload' 
    SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT MAX
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Changes made by specific users [#examples-who]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="events-users"
    title="What account changes have been made by any user?"
  >
    To see detailed information about any user who made changes to the account during a specific time frame, include [`actorType = 'user'`](#actorType) in the query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT actionIdentifier, description, actorEmail, actorId, targetType, targetId 
    FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actorType = 'user' 
    SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="who-changed"
    title="What account changes have been made by a specific user?"
  >
    To query account activities made by a specific person during the selected time frame, you must know their [`actorId`](#actorId). For example:

    ```
    SELECT actionIdentifier FROM NrAuditEvent 
    WHERE actorId = <var>829034</var> SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="most-changes"
    title="Who made the most changes to the account?"
  >
    To identify who ([`actorType`](#actorType)) has made the most changes to the account, include the [`actorEmail` attribute](#actorEmail) in your query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) as Users FROM NrAuditEvent 
    WHERE actorType = 'user' 
    FACET actorEmail SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="synth-user"
    title="Synthetic monitoring: What monitors were created by a specific user?"
  >
    To query updates from your synthetic monitors made by a specific user, include the [`actionIdentifier`](/attribute-dictionary/nrauditevent/actionidentifier) and [`actorEmail`](/attribute-dictionary/nrauditevent/actoremail) attribute in your query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent 
    WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' 
    FACET actorEmail, actionIdentifier, description 
    SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Changes made using the API [#examples-api]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="events-api-key"
    title="What account changes have been made using an API key?"
  >
    To see detailed information about changes to the account that were made using an API key during a specific time frame, include [`actorType = 'api_key'`](#actorType) in the query. For example:

    ```
    SELECT actionIdentifier, description, targetType, targetId, actorAPIKey, actorId, actorEmail 
    FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actorType = 'api_key' SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
