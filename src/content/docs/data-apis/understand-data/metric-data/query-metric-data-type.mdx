When metrics are reported to New Relic via the [Metric API](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api) (including from integrations that use that API), the data is reported as the [`Metric` data type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics) and is available for querying.

This document contains:

## Query APM metric timeslice data [#metric-timeslice]

APM reports a specific type of data that we call metric timeslice data. For how to query that, see [Query metric timeslice data](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql).

For information about other types of metrics, see [Metric data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics-new-relic).

## View and query your metrics [#view-and-query]

You can use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) to query your metric data in the [New Relic One query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) or using our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

To query a metric, use the following query format:

```
FROM <mark>Metric</mark> SELECT <var>function</var>(<var>metric_name</var>) WHERE <var>attribute</var>=<var>value</var> FACET <var>attribute</var> TIMESERIES
```

Below are the functions supported for each [metric type](/docs/report-metrics-metric-api#payload-metrics):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Metric type
      </th>

      <th>
        Supported functions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `Summary`
      </td>

      <td>
        count, sum, min, max, and average
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Count`
      </td>

      <td>
        sum
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Gauge`
      </td>

      <td>
        count, sum, min, max, average, and latest
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Add the names of the metrics you want to chart with the appropriate value functions in the `SELECT` clause. The `WHERE` and `FACET` clauses can be used with attribute values. Remember to include the keyword `TIMESERIES` if you want to chart the data.

This example demonstrates how you could chart the CPU usage in seconds for cluster `foo` . This query breaks down CPU usage by container, given a `count` metric named `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` with the attributes `containerName` and `clusterName`:

```
FROM Metric select sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total) 
  WHERE clusterName = 'foo' 
  FACET containerName 
  TIMESERIES
```

If you want the CPU usage per minute (the rate of change), then you can add the rate function to the query above.

```
FROM Metric select rate(sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), 1 minute) 
  WHERE clusterName = 'foo' 
  FACET containerName 
  TIMESERIES
```

## View example metric queries [#example-metric-queries]

The previous examples demonstrate basic forms of metric queries, but NRQL can also be used to chart, explore, and analyze metric data.

    title="Chart multiple metrics"
  >
    Chart multiple metrics using a single query by providing a comma-separated list of metrics in the `SELECT` clause. For example, to chart the memory usage for a container along with the memory limit metric, use the following query:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes), latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) 
      WHERE containerName = 'inventory' 
      TIMESERIES
    ```

    You can also do this using [wildcards](#query-multiple-metrics-wildcards), as explained below.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-math"
    title="Perform mathematical operations on metric data"
  >
    Perform math operations on one or more metrics to compute a new, derived metric. To monitor available memory, you can calculate the percentage of available memory from the two metrics used in the previous example:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT (latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(container_memory_usage_bytes)) 
        / latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) 
        * 100 
        AS '% Memory Available' 
      WHERE containerName = 'inventory' 
      TIMESERIES
    ```

    You can also do this using [wildcards](#query-multiple-metrics-wildcards), as explained below.

  <Collapser
    id="example-filters-timeseries"
    title="Use filters to select specific time series"
  >
    In addition to using a `WHERE` clause which applies to everything in `SELECT`, NRQL provides another aggregation function called `filter` which can be used to select a specific time series to be charted or operated on.

    The following example charts a memory usage metric labeled `"Total (k8s)"` which is computed by adding together the memory usage of two specific containers within a pod:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT filter(
        latest(
          container_memory_usage_bytes), 
        WHERE containerName = 'discovery') 
      + filter(
        latest(
          container_memory_usage_bytes), 
        WHERE containerName = 'istio-proxy') 
      AS 'Total (k8s)' 
      WHERE clusterName = 'my-cluster' AND podName LIKE 'istio-pilot-%' 
      TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-view-raw-datapoints"
    title="View the raw metric data points"
  >
    When querying metric data using `FROM Metric`, New Relic automatically selects the specific aggregate to use in the query, depending on the length of the query window and any bucket size specified as an argument to the `TIMESERIES` keyword. This ensures efficient querying and chart resolution. If you want to override this behavior to view or operate on the raw metric data points, use the optional `RAW` keyword in your query.

    When querying these raw metric data points, there is a query time window limit of 48 hours. Any query attempting to access more than 48 hours of raw metric data will result in a query error.

    This example shows how to list the last 20 data points received for a particular metric:

    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'container_fs_usage_bytes' LIMIT 20 <mark>RAW</mark>
    ```

## Query multiple metrics with wildcards [#query-multiple-metrics-wildcards]

Wildcards are represented in NRQL by the `%` character. If you want to query multiple metrics that use a standard naming convention, you can use the wildcard feature to return results for all of them without having to specify each metric name individually.

Wildcards can help you:

* Aggregate metrics together and chart the results
* `FACET` results by metric name in a chart
* Find and chart all metrics matching a given naming convention

Wildcards are particularly helpful if you later add new metrics matching an existing naming convention. By using `%` instead of writing out each metric name in your query, you won't have to rewrite the query when you add new metrics.

Let's say you have multiple algorithms that perform a similar task. You can define the following metrics, which show the duration of the different algorithms:

* `myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration`
* `myNeatProcess.algorithm2.duration`
* `myNeatProcess.algorithm3.duration`

If used in a query, `myNeatProcess.%.duration` will return results for all three of the algorithms above. If you later create new algorithms named `algorithm4`, `algorithm5`, and `algorithm6`, the same query will return results for all six algorithms.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-multiple-metrics-wildcard"
    title="Chart multiple metrics with wildcards"
  >
    You can chart multiple metrics using a single query by using wildcards (`%`) in the `SELECT` clause. For example, to query all the algorithms in the example above and plot a line on the chart for each algorithm's average duration, use the following query:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
    	SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) 
    	FACET metricName TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-math"
    title="Perform mathematical operations on metric data with wildcards"
  >
    You can also use wildcards to perform math operations on multiple metrics and compute a new metric. You can calculate the mean duration for all algorithms listed in the example above:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
    	SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES
    ```

    You can calculate what percentage of overall runtime a single algorithm takes:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
    	SELECT myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration / sum(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Return results for invidual fields using `getField()` [#use-getField]

Metrics have multiple fields associated with them, and each field contains its own unique values. If you would like to extract one of those values using a query, you can do that with `getField()`. 

For example, if you want to use a single value within a metric to do a comparison in a `WHERE` clause, you can use `getField(metricName, field)` or `metricName[field]`.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-list-gauge-metrics"
    title="List of gauge metrics"
  >
  This example query returns a list of gauge metrics:
    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE %[type] = 'gauge'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-list-names-host"
    title="List all metric names for a particular host"
  >

  The average value of a metric is computed as `total` over `count`, so the following query returns metric data where the result of the `average()` value function is greater than 2.
    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND apm.service.transaction.duration[total] / apm.service.transaction.duration[count] > 2
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Explore metric data [#explore-metric-data]

The NRQL `keyset` and `uniques` functions can be used together with the `metricName` attribute (available on all metrics) to perform tasks like listing all the available metrics in your account or discovering the attributes available on a particular metric.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-list-names-account"
    title="List all metric names in an account"
  >
    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName)
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-list-names-host"
    title="List all metric names for a particular host"
  >
    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE hostname = 'host1.mycompany.com'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-show-keys-metric"
    title="Show the attribute keys for a specific metric"
  >
    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = <var>METRIC_NAME</var>
    ```
  </Collapser>
