The New Relic platform reports four main [telemetry data types](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types): metrics, events, logs, and traces.

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the `Metric` data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see [Query metrics](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/).

## Metric types

The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `count`
      </td>

      <td>
        Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to `0` every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval.

        You must specify a value for `interval.ms` when reporting the `count` metric type using the [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/introduction-metric-api).

        The value must be a positive double.

        Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum:

        `From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute`) . . .
      </td>

      <td>
        * [sum](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-sum)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `distribution`
      </td>

      <td>
        Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

        This type:

        * Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type.
        * Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function.
      </td>

      <td>
        * percentile
        * histogram
        * min
        * max
        * sum
        * count
        * average
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `gauge`
      </td>

      <td>
        Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory.

        For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it.

        The value must fit into the range of a Java double.

        * latest
        * min
        * max
        * sum
        * count
        * average
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `summary`
      </td>

      <td>
        Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a `count`, `sum` value, `min` value, and `max` value. The `count` value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations.

        You must specify a value for `interval.ms` when reporting the `summary` metric type using the [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/introduction-metric-api).

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `uniqueCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

        This type is generated only via the [event-to-metrics service](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/introduction-events-metrics-service).
