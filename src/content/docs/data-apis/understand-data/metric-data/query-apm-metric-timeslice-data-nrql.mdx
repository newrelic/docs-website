APM reports metric data in the form of [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data), and you can use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to query, facet, and alert on this type of data. To explore timeslice data in the data explorer, see [Explore your metrics](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer#blocks-metrics).

## Why query metric timeslice data? [#why]

We report [metrics in several ways](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics). One variety of metric data we call **metric timeslice data**; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile, and browser (for more details, see [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data)).

Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial). This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your [custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics).

<Callout variant="important">
  You cannot query timeslice metrics in conjunction with dimensional metrics or event data. Any query involving `newrelic.timeslice.value` or an `apm.*` metric can only return APM metrics.
</Callout>

## Where to query? [#where]

We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using the New Relic One [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors.

You can also:

* Make NRQL queries using our [NerdGraph (GraphQL) API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph)
* Alert on NRQL queries using [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions)

## How to construct a query [#form-query]

In APM, some charts have the option to [view the NRQL query that generated that chart](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language#what-is-nrql). This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page.

```
FROM Metric
  SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration)
  WHERE (entity.guid = '<var>AN_ENTITY_GUID</var>')
  AND (transactionType = 'Web')
  SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES
```

Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "350px" }}>
        Query segment
      </th>

      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `FROM Metric`
      </td>

      <td>
        `Metric` is one of our core [data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics), and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying `Metric` data, see [Metric query examples](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data).

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `AND (transactionType = 'Web')`
      </td>

      <td>

## How metric timeslice data is converted [#timeslice-conversion]

The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you do not see a metric you're looking for in this section, see [Generic queries](#generic-queries).

Here are how the original [APM metric timeslice](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) metrics are converted into dimensional metrics:

<table style={{ width: "700px" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Metric timeslice structure
      </th>

      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody/>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes.

        For example, the “`Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select`” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table.
      </td>

      <td>
        A single dimensional metric named `apm.service.datastore.operation.duration` represents the entire group of datastore metrics.

        This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation:

        `datastoreType = ‘MySQL’`

        `table = ‘users’`

        `operation = ‘select’`
      </td>
    </tr>

## Generic queries with the `newrelic.timeslice.value` metric [#generic-queries]

For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named `newrelic.timeslice.value`.

<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the [table above](#timeslice-conversion) when possible.
</Callout>

### When to use `newrelic.timeslice.value`? [#when-to-use]

Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax:

```
FROM Metric
SELECT uniques(metricName)
WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select'
```

If the only metric name returned is `newrelic.timeslice.value`, you'll need to query your data using this general approach.

### Get available metrics [#get-list]

To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like:

```
SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) 
FROM Metric WHERE appName='<var>YOUR_APP_NAME</var>' 
AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL
```

## Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment [#wildcard]

Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format:

```
External/{externalHost}/all
```

Here, `{externalHost}` represents the host name for the outbound network call.

Here's an example of a [generic `newrelic.timeslice.value` query](#generic-queries) of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment:

```
FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) 
  WHERE appName = 'MY APP' 
  WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' 
  TIMESERIES FACET action
```

In this query, `{action}` creates a temporary attribute, `action`, which is then used by `FACET action`. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name.

## Recommended aggregator functions [#aggregator-functions]

Recommended NRQL [aggregator functions](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#functions) include:

* `apdex`
* `average`
* `sum`
* `count`
* `rate`
* `uniques`

## Query examples

Some examples of querying metric timeslice data:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="multiple-app-names"
    title="Facet by multiple app names"
  >
    This query uses [`WHERE… IN`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-where) to specify two applications and then facet by them:

    ```
    FROM Metric
      SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' 
      WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION')
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      FACET appName
      TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="rate"
    title="Throughput-per-minute rate"
  >
    This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the [`rate`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-rate) function:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="facet-by-host"
    title="Facet by host-related attributes"
  >
    This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago 
      FACET host 
      LIMIT 20
    ```

    Instead of using `host`, you can facet by other [host-related attributes](/node/36916/revisions/402556/view#infrastructure-attributes), like `host.bootId`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="average"
    title="Query of average duration of a metric"
  >
    This queries the average duration for a metric using [`average`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-average):

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web') 
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="average"
    title="Break down average time spent in a transaction by its component segments"
  >
    This query breaks down the average duration of single transaction (in this case, the `show` action in the `UsersController` of a Rails app named `MY_APPLICATION`) by the top 20 individual segments (database queries, external service calls, garbage collection time, etc.). It reproduces much of the "Application breakdown" chart as seen on the Transactions page In New Relic One for a service entity:

    ```
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value, exclusiveTime: true) as 'duration, seconds' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND scope = 'Controller/users/show'
      LIMIT 20 
      FACET metricTimesliceName
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
