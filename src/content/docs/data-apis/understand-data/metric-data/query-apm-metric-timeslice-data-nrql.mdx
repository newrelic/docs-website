APM reports metric data in the form of [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data), and you can use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to query, facet, and alert on this type of data. To explore timeslice data in metrics and events, see [Explore your metrics](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer#blocks-metrics).

## Why query metric timeslice data? [#why]

We report [metrics in several ways](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics). One variety of metric data we call **metric timeslice data**; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile, and browser (for more details, see [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data)).

Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular <InlinePopover type="apm" /> metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial). This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your [custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics).

<Callout variant="important">
  You cannot query timeslice metrics in conjunction with dimensional metrics or event data. Any query involving `newrelic.timeslice.value` or an `apm.*` metric can only return APM metrics.
</Callout>

## Where to query? [#where]

We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using our [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors.

You can also:

* Make NRQL queries using our [NerdGraph (GraphQL) API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph)
* Alert on NRQL queries using [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions)

## How to construct a query [#form-query]

In APM, some charts have the option to [view the NRQL query that generated that chart](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language#what-is-nrql). This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the <InlinePopover type="apm" /> summary page.

```sql
FROM Metric
  SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration)
  WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID')
  AND (transactionType = 'Web')
  SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES
```

Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "350px" }}>
        Query segment
      </th>

      <th>
        What does it do?
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `FROM Metric`
      </td>

      <td>
        `Metric` is one of our core [data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics), and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying `Metric` data, see [Metric query examples](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data).

      <td>
        This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the [converted metric names](#timeslice-conversion).

        Note that you can use other [aggregator functions](#aggregator-functions).

      <td>
        You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can [select multiple sources](#multiple-app-names). This query uses `entity.guid`, but you can also use `appId` or `appName`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `AND (transactionType = 'Web')`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted.
      </td>
    </tr>

## How metric timeslice data is converted [#timeslice-conversion]

The conversion of original <InlinePopover type="apm" /> metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see [Generic queries](#generic-queries).

Here are how the original [APM metric timeslice](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) metrics are converted into dimensional metrics:

<table style={{ width: "700px" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Metric timeslice structure
      </th>

      <th>
        Dimensional metric structure
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody/>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes.

        For example, the “`Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select`” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table.
      </td>

      <td>
        A single dimensional metric named `apm.service.datastore.operation.duration` represents the entire group of datastore metrics.

        This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation:

        `datastoreType = ‘MySQL’`

        `table = ‘users’`

        `operation = ‘select’`
      </td>
    </tr>

To get the metric unit for a given metric name, you can use a query like:
```sql
FROM Metric
  SELECT metricUnit
  WHERE appName = 'YOUR_APP_NAME'
  AND metricName = 'METRIC_NAME'
```

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Overview metrics [#overview-metrics]

Overview metrics allow you to get a breakdown of where time is spent during execution. These metrics are unique in a few ways:

* They are a combination of many timeslices.
* They are designed to work with the `average` aggregator function only.
* Code executed concurrently will show the combined execution time.

For example, if your service calls a MySQL database in 3 concurrent threads with an average response time of 0.1 seconds for each thread, the MySQL segment will show up as 0.3.

Several overview metrics are provided for different purposes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Metric name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>

      <th>
        Attributes
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `apm.service.overview.web`
      </td>

      <td>
        Breakdown of time spent in different parts of the service for web transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        segmentName
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `apm.service.overview.other`
      </td>

      <td>
        Breakdown of time spent in different parts of the service for background/non-web transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        segmentName
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `apm.service.transaction.overview`
      </td>

      <td>
        Breakdown of time spent in a specific transaction
      </td>

      <td>
        metricTimesliceName
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

## Generic queries with the `newrelic.timeslice.value` metric [#generic-queries]

For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named `newrelic.timeslice.value`.

<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the [table above](#timeslice-conversion) when possible.
</Callout>

### When to use `newrelic.timeslice.value`? [#when-to-use]

Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax:

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT uniques(metricName)
WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select'
```

If the only metric name returned is `newrelic.timeslice.value`, you'll need to query your data using this general approach.

### Get available metrics [#get-list]

To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like:

```sql
SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) 
FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' 
AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL
```

## Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment [#wildcard]

Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format:

```
External/{externalHost}/all
```

Here, `{externalHost}` represents the host name for the outbound network call.

Here's an example of a [generic `newrelic.timeslice.value` query](#generic-queries) of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) 
  WHERE appName = 'MY APP' 
  WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' 
  TIMESERIES FACET action
```

In this query, `{action}` creates a temporary attribute, `action`, which is then used by `FACET action`. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name.

## Recommended aggregator functions [#aggregator-functions]

Recommended NRQL [aggregator functions](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#functions) include:

* `apdex`
* `average`
* `sum`
* `count`
* `rate`
* `uniques`

## Query examples

Some examples of querying metric timeslice data:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="multiple-app-names"
    title="Facet by multiple app names"
  >
    This query uses [`WHERE… IN`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-where) to specify two applications and then facet by them:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric
      SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' 
      WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION')
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      FACET appName
      TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="rate"
    title="Throughput-per-minute rate"
  >
    This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the [`rate`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-rate) function:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="facet-by-host"
    title="Facet by host-related attributes"
  >
    This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web')
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago 
      FACET host 
      LIMIT 20
    ```

    Instead of using `host`, you can facet by other [host-related attributes](/node/36916/revisions/402556/view#infrastructure-attributes), like `host.bootId`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="average"
    title="Query of average duration of a metric"
  >
    This queries the average duration for a metric using [`average`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-average):

    ```sql
    FROM Metric
      SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND (transactionType = 'Web') 
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="average"
    title="Break down average time spent in a transaction by its component segments"
  >
    This query breaks down the average duration of single transaction (in this case, the `show` action in the `UsersController` of a Rails app named `MY_APPLICATION`) by the top 20 individual segments (database queries, external service calls, garbage collection time, etc.). It reproduces much of the "Application breakdown" chart as seen on the APM transactions page for a service entity:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric 
      SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value, exclusiveTime: true) as 'duration, seconds' 
      WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' 
      AND scope = 'Controller/users/show'
      LIMIT 20 
      FACET metricTimesliceName
      TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
