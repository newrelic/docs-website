The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: [metrics](#metrics), [events](#event-data), [logs](#log-data), and [traces](#trace-data) (often referred to as "MELT" in the observability industry).

After you [sign up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and [install](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/install-new-relic) any of our monitoring services, you can start working with your data.

## Get started understanding our data [#get-started]

In this doc, we'll give a fairly technical explanation of our core MELT data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you [get data into New Relic](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/get-custom-data-from-any-source), understand the data you see in our UI, and [query and chart your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data).

## Metrics

First, we'll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we'll explain how New Relic handles metrics.

### Metrics in the monitoring industry [#metrics-conceptual]

In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule.

Two major types of metrics are:

* Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute's time, or the rate of some event per minute.
* A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status.

Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage.

Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, [event data](#event-data) can be used.

### Metrics at New Relic [#metrics-new-relic]

Conceptually, "metrics" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to "metrics," regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding [how to query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data)).

Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="dimensional-metrics"
    title="Dimensional metrics (the Metric data type)"
  >
    In the monitoring industry, "dimensional" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, and more. This level of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying.

    At New Relic, this metric data is attached to our [`Metric`](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/metric-data-type) data type. This is our primary metric data type and is used by many of our tools, including:

    * Our integrations with third-party telemetry services, like our [OpenTelemetry integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction), our [Prometheus integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic), and our [DropWizard integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/dropwizard/dropwizard-reporter).

    * The [Metric API](/docs/introduction-new-relic-metric-api) (the underlying API used by the above tools).

    * The [events-to-metrics service](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-events-metrics-service).

      To query the `Metric` data type, you could use a NRQL query like:

      ```sql
      Select * from Metric
      ```

      As time passes, metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time.

      For more details about `Metric` data, see [`Metric` data structure](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/metric-data-type). For tips on querying this data, see [Metric query examples](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data).

      Some of our other metric data types are exposed as dimensional metrics and are available for querying. For example:

    * [APM metric timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-apm-metric-timeslice-data-nrql)

    * [Some infrastructure data](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="timeslice-data"
    title="Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile)"
  >
    New Relic's APM, browser, and <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as <DNT>**metric timeslice data**</DNT>. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the "timeslice"), and a numeric value (the measurement).

    For example: an <InlinePopover type="apm"/> metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named `WebTransaction/URI/foo`, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like `<category>/<class>/<method>`.

    Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create [custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics).

    Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that [dimensional metrics](#dimensional-metrics) have.

    Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data:

    * For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be [queried via NRQL](/docs/query-metric-timeslice-data-dimensional-metrics)
    * Use the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2)

          <DNT>
            **Apdex**
          </DNT>

          [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times.

          <DNT>
            **Controller**
          </DNT>

          In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client.

          The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects.

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>

          <DNT>
            **Errors**
          </DNT>

          This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests.

          <DNT>
            **External services**
          </DNT>

          External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class backend components such as MemCache and the database.

          In Ruby applications we instrument the `Net::Http` library to capture all HTTP services.

            **MemCache**
          </DNT>

          MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits.

          These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment.

          <DNT>
            **Mongrel**
          </DNT>

          This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue.

          When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths.

          A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements.

          <DNT>
            **View**
          </DNT>

          `ActionView` is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The `View` is rendered by the controller that is handling the request.

          If `View` metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself.

    Because [event-type data](#event-data) can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) attached to an event.

    A couple examples of this at New Relic:

    * Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a `ProcessSample` event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see [Infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events).
    * In APM, the `Transaction` event has several metrics attached to it, including `databaseDuration`.

      To learn more about this data and how to query it, see [Events](#events-new-relic).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="metric-event-computation"
    title="Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries)"
  >
    Metrics can be formed by counting [New Relic events](#event-data), or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of `Transaction` events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query:

    ```sql
    Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago
    ```

    Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like:

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago
    ```

    Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see [Event limits and sampling](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/new-relic-events-limits-sampling).

## Event data [#event-data]

First, we'll explain the definition of <DNT>**events**</DNT> from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we'll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data.

### Events in the monitoring industry [#event-conceptual]

In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse.

Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an <DNT>**event**</DNT>.

Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges.

### Events at New Relic [#events-new-relic]

At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called <DNT>**events**</DNT>. These events have multiple [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also [query it](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). How long event data remains available is determined by [data retention rules](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/extend-event-data-retention).

One example of an event: APM reports an event type named [`Transaction`](/attribute-dictionary/?event=Transaction), which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) attached to this event, you could use a [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) query like:

```sql
Select * from Transaction
```

For examples of querying event data, see [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#examples).

Other details about New Relic event data:

* Events can have any type of [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) attached. Some events have [attributes that report metric data](#metric-event-attributes).
* You can report [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights#ways).
* To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can [turn events into metrics](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/convert-to-metrics/analyze-monitor-data-trends-metrics/).
* Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see [Event sampling](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/new-relic-events-limits-sampling).
* Because <DNT>**event**</DNT> is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to [any data type that can be queried via NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query). For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of [inspected events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/rate-limits-insights#inspected-count-limits): this is a count of all data types queried.

## Log data [#log-data]

First, we'll explain the definition of <DNT>**logs**</DNT> from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we'll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting.

### Logs in the monitoring industry [#logs-conceptual]

A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems.

### Logs at New Relic [#logs-new-relic]

Our [<InlinePopover type="logs"/>](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management) capabilities give you a centralized platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can [see logs alongside your APM data](/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context).

In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like:

```sql
Select * from Log
```

To report custom log data, see the [Log API](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs-api).

## Trace data [#trace-data]

First, we'll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we'll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing.

### Tracing in the monitoring industry [#tracing-conceptual]

In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, <DNT>**tracing**</DNT> is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a <DNT>**stack trace**</DNT> provides in-depth information about a program's subroutines.

For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to <DNT>**distributed tracing**</DNT>, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment.

### Tracing at New Relic [#new-relic-tracing]

New Relic offers a [distributed tracing feature](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as `Span` objects, with multiple [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (key-value pairs) attached.

To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like:

```sql
Select * from Span
```

To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see [Understand distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works).

To report custom distributed tracing data, see the [Trace API](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-new-relic-trace-api).
