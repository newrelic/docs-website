### New docs

* [.NET OpenTracing to AWS Lambda layers migration guide](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/opentracing-to-layers-migration-guide) helps you migrate from .NET OpenTracing to the .NET APM agent Lambda layer.
* Use [XCFramework manual installation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/xcframework-installation) when you want to install the New Relic iOS agent manually.

### Major changes

* Finalized updates and improvements to our branching [install the .NET agent](/install/dotnet/) to make it easier to find the information you're looking for and get set up monitoring your app. 
* In [NRQL reference](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-histogram), added additional arguments and default values, as well as updates to [histogram response times](histogram-response-times-defaults) to make it easier to write queries related to these aggregator functions.


### Minor changes

* In [charts and dashboards: visualizing your data](/docs/nrql/get-started/charts-and-dashboards-with-nrql/#performance-improvement-for-dashboard-and-charts), added tips on how to improve your dashboard and chart performance.
* In [infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#process-container-decoration), added section that describes how the agent decorates process samples with container information when `process_container_decoration` is enabled.
* Simplified compatible version information in [.NET agent: compatibility and requirements for .NET Core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core).
* Added note in several Python APM configuration docs when a configuration option is disabled when high security mode is enabled.
* In [issues and incident management and response](/docs/alerts/incident-management/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#search-filters), added a note clarifying when warning and critical alert incidents are created.
