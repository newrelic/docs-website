### New docs

* [.NET OpenTracing to AWS Lambda layers migration guide](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/opentracing-to-layers-migration-guide) helps you migrate from .NET OpenTracing to the .NET APM agent Lambda layer.
* Use [XCFramework manual installation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/xcframework-installation) when you want to install the New Relic iOS agent manually.
* Security bulletin [NR24-02 - OpenSSH in New Relic Salesforce Exporter](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr24-02) describes the recommendations and actions required to take if you're using the New Relic Salesforce Exporter.

### Major changes

* Finalized updates and improvements to our branching [install the .NET agent](/install/dotnet/) to make it easier to find the information you're looking for and get set up monitoring your app.
* In [NRQL reference](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-histogram), added additional arguments and default values, as well as updates to [histogram response times](histogram-response-times-defaults) to make it easier to write queries related to these aggregator functions.
* In our UI, we've replaced `Add data` with `Integrations & Agents`. We've swept our docs site to reflect this.
* Clarified the differences between cancelling an account and deleting an organization in [downgrade or cancel New Relic](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account/#cancel-account) and [NerdGraph tutorial: View, create, rename, or cancel accounts](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph).

### Minor changes

* In [charts and dashboards: visualizing your data](/docs/nrql/get-started/charts-and-dashboards-with-nrql/#performance-improvement-for-dashboard-and-charts), added tips on how to improve your dashboard and chart performance.
* In [infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#process-container-decoration), added section that describes how the agent decorates process samples with container information when `process_container_decoration` is enabled.
* Simplified compatible version information in [.NET agent: compatibility and requirements for .NET Core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core).
* Added note in several Python APM configuration docs when a configuration option is disabled when high security mode is enabled.
* In [issues and incident management and response](/docs/alerts/incident-management/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#search-filters), added a note clarifying when warning and critical alert incidents are created.
* Updated the diagram at the top of [instrument your non-containerized Lambda function](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/instrument-your-own/).
* Deleted "RightScale users and New Relic". RightScale was a partnership that's long been defunct.
* Noted that ServiceNow ITSM is a legacy alerts notification integration. Use [ServiceNow's certified integration](/docs/alerts/get-notified/notification-integrations/#servicenow-certified) instead.
* Combined and relocated all of our [Kubernetes integration version 2](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/k8s-version2/overview/) docs to one subcategory on our site. Kubernetes version 3 is the latest and we recommend you use that instead.
* You can't [rotate our REST API keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#rotate-rest-api-key), because this older key is deprecated. If you're using a REST API key, delete it and use [one of our other keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#rotate-keys) instead.
