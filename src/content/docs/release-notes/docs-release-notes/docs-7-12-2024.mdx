### New docs

* A new branching [Kubernetes monitoring integration](/install/kubernetes/) installation doc helps you find the specific installation information you need.
* Install, configure, and monitor your [dbt Cloud](/docs/more-integrations/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-integration) data running on Apache Airflow and using Snowflake.
* Our new [Kubernetes agent operator](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-agent-operator) automates APM agent instrumentation so you no longer have to manually manage them. Now in public preview.
* The iOS agent added support for sending [mobile logs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-logs) and [watchOS instrumentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/watchOS/instrument-watchos) to New Relic.
* [Troubleshoot no data appears for AWS Lambda](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-no-data-appears) describes solutions when you're not seeing your AWS Lambda data in the UI.
* [Android agent native crash reporting](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/android-agent-native-crash-reporting) describes how to enable, configure, and debug the crash reporter.
* [Title template for NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/condition-details/title-template) describes how to use title templates to create meaningful titles for your alerts incidents.
* [Traceloop LLM observability with OpenLLMetry](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/traceloop-llm-observability/traceloop-llm-observability-intro) describes how to use this OpenTelemetry-based tool to monitor your AI model performance.

### Major changes

* Content and style updates to linking [APM-instrumented](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-apm-applications-kubernetes) and [OpenTelemetry-instrumented](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-otel-applications-kubernetes) applications improve readability and make it easier to get this set up. We've also updated our intro to the [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) to improve style and clarity.
* Updated our docs to reflect the per GB price change, for example in [data ingest billing and rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-prices).
* Added new [`MobileApplicationExit`](/attribute-dictionary/?dataSource=Mobile&event=MobileApplicationExit) attributes to our data dictionary.
* Added Azure-specific installation information to [install the .NET agent](/install/dotnet/?deployment=azure&azure=azuresiteextension).
* On July 3, 2024, our [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements/#compatibility) dropped support for Kubernetes v1.25 and lower.
* A large rewrite of [Meet New Relic AI, your observability assistant](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai) describes how to get the most out of our AI tools.
* Updated [infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#is_integrations_only) with configuration information on the new `is_integrations_only` setting. Enable this setting if you're instrumenting a host from a source other than the infrastructure agent, such as an OpenTelemetry collector or Prometheus node exporter.

### Minor changes

* Various updates related to the new Kubernetes agent operator.
* Updates to OpenTelemetry docs fixed some broken anchor links, added timeout configuration info to [OTLP endpoint](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp/#payload-limits), and other consistency improvements.
* Updated [AWS PrivateLink](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/aws-privatelink/#regions-zones) to clarify that we support multiple regions
* Updated our [Node.js agent compatibility table](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/#system) to list support for Node.js version 22.
* Moved our .NET agent Azure troubleshooting docs into the [troubleshooting category](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/azure-cloud-services-no-data-appears/).
* Updated `issueId` and added `entityGuid` in [/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/security-data-api](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/security-data-api/#req-fields).
* Fixed error in code snippet in [Cacti integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/cacti-integration/).
* Updated [layerless instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless/#dotnet) to clarify that .NET Lambda doesn't require layers.
* Updated [control when the Ruby agent starts](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/troubleshooting/control-when-ruby-agent-starts) to describe how to turn off the agent in specific contexts.
* We removed the inline sign-up forms across our docs site.
* Added instructions on how to configure and forward Temporal logs in [Temporal self hosted monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/temporal-monitoring-integration/#temporal-logs-configuration).
* [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#os), [SNMP performance](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring/#linux), [network syslog](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-syslog-monitoring/#linux), and [network flow data](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring/#linux) monitoring ended support for CentOS 7 on June 30, 2024.
* Updated [rate limits with NRQL](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) with NerdGraph's 5 second default query timeout.
* Updated [application not responding](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/application-not-responding) with new screenshots and server-side configuration details.
* Fixed syntax error for `disable_all_plugins` in [reduce the infrastructure agent's CPU footprint](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/reduce-infrastructure-agents-cpu-footprint) troubleshooting guide.
* CodeStream [code-level metrics](/docs/codestream/observability/code-level-metrics/#requirements) for PHP requires the PHP Intelephense extension.
* In [remove applications from New Relic](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-new-relic/#wait-longer), clarified that you can delete an application when New Relic hasn't received any data from that app for 12 or more hours.
* Merged our Kubernetes reduce data ingest and data governance docs into a single [reduce data ingested](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/reduce-ingest) page.
* Updated [AWS FireLens plugin for log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-firelens-plugin-log-forwarding/#firelens-plugin) with several new AWS regions we now support and their image repositories.
* Updated [incident workflows](/docs/alerts/get-notified/alert-event-workflows/#navigate-notification-log) with current notification log columns.
* Updated [compatibility and requirements for the Java agent](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent/#JDBC) to let you know that our Java agent version 8.13.0 or higher supports HikariCP 2.4.0 to latest. (This replaces the HikariCP incubator module.)
* The .NET agent now supports [`Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch`](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements/#app-frameworks-core) version 8.14.5.
