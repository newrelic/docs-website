### New docs

* Our new [NVIDIA Triton integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nvidia-triton-integration) monitors the deployment and management of AI models in production environments via the infrastructure agent.
* Our infrastructure agent Azure monitor integration now supports [Azure Recovery Services Vaults](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-recovery-services-vaults-monitoring-integration).

### Major changes

* We just rolled-out a completely redesigned docs homepage! [Check it out](https://docs.newrelic.com/)! We wanted to:
  * Put search front and center.
  * Show a more linear, clear onboarding path for new users.
  * Remove the left nav to reduce overwhelm for newbies.
  * Create a clear path into docs for each of our capabilities.
  * Add more animation and color for a more attractive, dynamic, and modern look-and-feel.
  * Improve consistency between docs, [newrelic.com](https://newrelic.com/), and the product UI.
* Continued to rewrite the on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week:
  * [Apache Hadoop](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-hadoop-monitoring-integration/)
  * [Apache Zookeeper](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/zookeeper-monitoring-integration/)
  * [Nextcloud](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nextcloud-integration/)
  * [NGINX](/install/nginx/)
  * [Redpanda](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/redpanda-integration/)
  * [Sendmail](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/sendmail-monitoring-integration/)
  * [VMware VSphere](/install/vsphere/)
* [Thresholds](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts/#thresholds) are a new chart customization to add useful context to your charts.

### Minor changes

* AI monitoring isn't FedRAMP-authorized and we've noted that in the [services not in scope](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/certificates-standards-regulations/fedramp/#not-scope) table.
* We've clarified how to [instrument Go slog logger logs inside of a transaction](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go) and provided a better code example of how to do this.
* Updated our NerdGraph synthetics tutorial with a new example [query to retrieve the status of all runtime upgrade tests](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#query-runtime-upgrade-status).
* Our [IBM MQ integration](/install/ibm-mq/) is compatible with IBM MQ version 9.0 or higher and our docs reflect that now.
* Added manual and automatic instrumentation instructions for [Ruby Lambda functions](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless/#ruby).
* In our [OpenTelemetry Java tutorial](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-tutorial-java/#traces), clarified that the OpenTelemetry and New Relic Java agents do error handling differently for traces.
* With version 9.9.0, the Python agent now monitors [runtime metrics for physical memory](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#runtime-metrics). This is enabled by default.
* Replaced UI path with direct link to [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer/#set-up) in our UI.
* Removed exception to our statement that all [CloudWatch metrics](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) from all AWS services are available.
* Modified our [Networks](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks) doc to update endpoints and clarify who to reach out to before updating them in future.
* Updated [browser API `onEnd()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/onend) function syntax.
* For Kubernetes synthetic monitoring [containerized private minions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms), removed Windows as a supported deployment option and clarified that Linux containers can only run on Linux nodes.
* Updated [Java agent classloading issues from JBoss and Wildfly](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/classloading-issues-from-jboss-and-wildfly) troubleshooting doc to remove tabs.
* For [Alerts webhook notification](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations/#set-webhook-destination) integrations, we no longer support OAuth 2.0.
