### New docs

* A new [OpenTelemetry data in New Relic](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-data-overview) doc is an index to help you find the OpenTelemetry info you're looking for.

### Major changes

* We've combined all our [.NET API](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/net-agent-api) docs so now you can see them all in one place.
* Consolidated Java and Python APM info into [Monitor APM apps and services with OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro) so you can get this info in one place.

### Minor changes

* Updated [PHP agent operating system support](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/#operating-systems) to state that we support an OS version one year after a vendor's end-of-life date. (This saves us some maintenance overhead, because we don't need to list specific versions now.)
* Our .NET APM agent for .NET Core and Framework now supports `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` v5.2.1. Also, .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher requires .NET APM agent version 10.0 or higher.
* On our homepage, we've broken OpenTelemetry out into its own tile button.
* In [Forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent), clarified that using ANSI encoding on `winevtlog` addresses empty string logs, but isn't used to convert ANSI to UTF-8. Added example `use-ansi` entries.
* Updated some non-standard callouts to use our recommended format.
* In [Send your logging data with our Log API](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#attributes), added `"msg"` to the JSON message attributes table.
* Added `http.response.status_code` from http span link to OpenTelemetry docs in [OpenTelemetry APM errors inbox UI](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-ui/#errors-inbox-page).
* In [APM: Monitor apps and services with OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/#apm-agents), added a new section that lists things to keep in mind when you're running APM agents alongside OpenTelemetry tools.
