### New docs

* [Optimize your data ingest](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/data-governance-optimize-ingest-guide) is the third installment in a four-part series on achieviing observability maturity and maximizing the benefits of an observability platform.
* [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel) outlines the process to monitor a Kubernetes cluster with OpenTelemetry. This feature is still under development.

### Major changes

* Consolidated .NET Core and Framework compatibility docs into a single place in [.NET agent: compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements).
* Updated [understand and query high cardinality metrics](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/NRQL-high-cardinality-metrics/) to indicate how to [adjust cardinality limits](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/NRQL-high-cardinality-metrics/#adjusting-cardinality-limits).
* Updated the guidelines to [size and organize a partition](/docs/logs/ui-data/data-partitions/#size) in [data partitions](/docs/logs/ui-data/data-partitions).
* In the New Relic Flutter agent installation procedure, updated the instructions to [configure an Android app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-flutter/monitor-your-flutter-application/#configure-android).
* In the New Relic Ionic Capacitor agent installation procedure, updated the instructions to [configure a native Android app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ionic-capacitor/get-started/introduction-new-relic-ionic-capacitor/#android-only-if-youre-monitoring-an-android-native-app-follow-these-steps).
* In the New Relic Unity agent installation procedure, updated the instructions to [configure an Android app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-unity/monitor-your-unity-application/#configure-android).
* In the New Relic React Native agent installation procedure, updated the instructions to [configure an Android app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-monitoring-react-native/monitor-your-react-native-application/#android-install).
* Added an entry for a new hostname variable called [exclude_matching-metrics](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#exclude-matching-metrics). Use the variable to prevent unwanted data from being sent to New Relic.

### Minor changes

* Added back the guides to migrate the .NET agent from [8.x to 9.x](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/8x-to-9x-agent-migration-guide) and from [9.x to 10.x](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/9x-to-10x-agent-migration-guide).
* Updated the [restrictions](/docs/logs/log-api/log-event-data/#attributes) table in [log event data](/docs/logs/log-api/log-event-data) to call out that `instrumentation.name`, `instrumentation.provider`, and `instrumentation.version` are reserved for internal use in mobile and browser integrations. Do not use these attributes in your application code.
* Fixed the GraphQL query to [retrieve browser application configuration](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/combining-npm-nerdgraph/#retrieve-app-config).
* Updated the private minion dashboard JSON under prerequisites in [monitor private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/monitor-private-locations).
* Simplified the steps to [install](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/installation/install-automation-new-relic-go/#go-easy-install) and [use](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/installation/install-automation-new-relic-go/#generate-suggestions) [Go instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/installation/install-automation-new-relic-go/) tool.
* Added the Amazon S3 network endpoints for US and EU under [user-facing domains](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#user-facing-domains) in [New Relic network traffic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks). Ensure that your network doesn't block these endpoints. Otherwise, the Synthetics UI may malfunction.
* Corrected the supported Joomla version for the PHP agent in [compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/#frameworks).
* Changed the default values of ` backgroundReportingEnabled` and `newEventSystemEnabled` in the code to [configure a Flutter project](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-flutter/monitor-your-flutter-application/#configure) and to [configure a React Native app](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-monitoring-react-native/monitor-your-react-native-application/#add-code).
* Fixed some minor inaccuracies and technical issues in [Elasticsearch monitoring integration](/install/elastic/).
