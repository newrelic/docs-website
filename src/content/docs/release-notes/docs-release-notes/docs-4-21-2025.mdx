### New docs

* [NerdGraph tutorial: Managing the Metric Normalization Rules](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-metric-normalization-rule) provides guidance on using NerdGraph for managing metric normalization rules.
* [Scorecards templates library](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/templates) has customizable templates for engineering and business use cases, grounded in enterprise best practices to tackle common challenges.
* [New Relic OTel K8s Metrics Mapping](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel-metrics) outlines how Kubernetes OpenTelemetry metrics are mapped to New Relic Kubernetes metrics.


### Major changes

* Added `sampler.remote_parent_sampled` in [Java Agent Configuration: Config File](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#dt-sampler-remote-parent-sampled) to define how the agent should handle sampling spans when their parent span from an upstream entity was sampled.
* Update the [SCIM provisioning](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim) to specify that it now requires a <DNT>**Paid Edition**</DNT> for automated user management in New Relic.
* Updated the [Cloud Rule APIs](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/cloud-rules-api/#drop-attributes-on-dimensional-metric-rollups) document for pipeline control to include information on how to drop attributes from dimensional metric rollups.
* Added a query to track login and logout events on the [Account Change Tracking](/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/query-account-audit-logs-nrauditevent/#user-login) page.

### Minor changes

* Updated the [.Net agent compatibility version](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements/#framework).
*  Removed the limitation on PingOne in [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) that was previously unsupported due to group provisioning restrictions.
* Added a limitation in the [Anomaly Detection](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/anomaly-detection/) page specifying no support for monthly or yearly seasonality due to computational limits.
* Updated the [Node.js agent compatibility report](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent).
* Added batching and compression settings for infinite tracing to the [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/#infinite-tracing-batching) document.
