### New docs

* [NR24-01 security bulletin](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr24-01) addresses the recent Fluent Bit security vulnerability.
* A new [Cacti integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/cacti-integration) gives you information on how to see your RRD data in New Relic.

### Major changes

* We've moved away from using `applied intelligence` to refer to our Alerts capability. This creates a clearer, more cohesive experience as we introduce more AI features and functionalities. We completed a massive sweep to remove nearly all mention of "applied intelligence" from our docs.
* Deleted several old, outdated alerts docs.
* A rewrite of [change vulnerability status](/docs/vulnerability-management/change-vulnerability-status) makes it easier for you to enable this feature.

### Minor changes

* Removed the notifications section from [CodeStream settings](/docs/codestream/codestream-settings/account-settings).
* Added a new OpenTelemetry [redis instance](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources) section to clarify that you need to manually include redis attributes for the collector.
* Private Synthetics Job Managers now support [permanent data storage](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#permanent-data-storage) via synthetic monitoring.
* Added New Relic partner API endpoint to networks [user-facing domains](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#user-facing-domains) table.
* Added version tracking metadata environment variables to the [Ruby agent's sending handled errors](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/sending-handled-errors-new-relic/#version-tracking).
* Added environment variables for .NET Lambda monitoring for [serverless](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/configure-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda/#dotnet) and [layerless](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless/#dotnet).
* Multiple docs updates related to hybrid mobile agent releases.
* We've updated our docs to remove unsupported [.NET Core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core) versions. (We no longer support .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 3.0.)
* In response to customer feedback, updated info on how to [view script logs](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/view-simple-scripted-monitor-results/#viewing-logs) in the synthetic monitoring UI.
* Thanks to our Docs engineering team, we no longer hardcode `v` into our release notes titles.
* Quality-of-life improvements to [view slow query details](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/view-slow-query-details) removed some outdated content and brought procedural content up-to-date.
