### New docs

* Added new feature on [How to debug New Relic Browser Agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/how-to-debug-browser-agent/) issues, including detailed logging, network request monitoring, and inspection events for enhanced troubleshooting in agent versions 1.285.0 and higher.
* Added [Environment variables](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/env-variables-azure/), [Linux instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/linux/), [Windows instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/windows/), and [Containerized instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/azure-function-monitoring/container/) for Azure function monitoring.
* Added [Cost optimizer](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/compute-optimizer/) for actionable insights to enhance compute efficiency, with features for identifying inefficiencies, providing optimization recommendations, and estimating CCU savings in the New Relic platform.
* Added [Cloud Cost Intelligence], offering tools for visibility and management of cloud costs, including features such as comprehensive cost breakdowns, Kubernetes cost allocation, real-time cost estimation, and cross-account data collection, currently supporting only AWS cloud costs.
* Added [OpenTelemetry observability for Kubernetes with New Relic](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/k8s-otel/intro/) featuring provider-agnostic integration for seamless monitoring of clusters through the Helm chart, enhancing telemetry signals for metrics, events, and logs transmitted to New Relic's tools and dashboards.
* Added [Limitation and troubleshooting for Windows integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-windows/)
* Added AWS integration via [CloudFormation and CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integration-for-metrics/via-cloudformation/), supporting API Polling for unsupported services.
