### New docs

* Our [Java Vert.x Event Bus integration](/docs/more-integrations/java-integrations/vertx-eventbus-integration) and [Java instrumentation for Vert.x extensions](/docs/more-integrations/java-integrations/vertx-extensions-integration) docs help our users extend the instrumentation of our Java APM agent for popular Java technologies, such as Cassandara, MongoDB, and Kafka, among others.
* Our new [OpenTelemetry troubleshooting doc](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-otlp-troubleshooting) helps our customers troubleshoot common OpenTelemetry issues. This is broken up into general troubleshooting tips and common customer issues.

### Major changes

* Added several new images to [session traces](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle), as well as updates to prerequisites, configuration, and use cases. Session trace data is billable starting June 10, 2024.
* As part of our Developer-to-Docs site migration project, we've migrated some content related to the SDK component library.
* Updated [global technical support offerings](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings) to relect our current support policies and SLAs.

### Minor changes

* In our [ServiceNow notification integration](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations) doc, updated links to ServiceNow's app store and added useful context about how to update ServiceNow attributes directly.
* In our [Serverless Framework manual install log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3/#serverless-install) instructions, added commands to install a serverless plugin for Python requirements and packaging the files and dependencies.
* Added JavaScript examples, such as how to instument a web transaction, to our [Node.js agent API doc](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/nodejs-agent-api).
* Drupal 10.2 introduced a change that can prevent the PHP agent from auto-injecting the browser auto-instrumentation. We updated various docs, such as [Browser monitoring and the PHP agent](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/features/browser-monitoring-php-agent/#manual-drupal), to let people know of this change.
* Updated [Grok logs parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing/#grok) to show how to add optional parameters.
* When using the [CyberArk REST API](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management/#cyberark-api) to manage secrets, added info about how to call username and password.
* For our Android mobile agent [Gradle plugin configuration](src/content/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-new-relic-gradle-plugin), clarified when and why you'd want to use the `variantMapsEnabled` option.
* We've reworked and consolidated several OpenTelemetry docs related to exporting OpenTelemetry data to New Relic.
* Updated the tables in this [NerdGraph dashboards doc](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-dashboards) from Markdown to our standard React component.
* Clarified the required permissions when monitoring [IBM MQ](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/ibmmq-monitoring-integration/#permissions) infrastructure.
* Across several infrastructure integrations docs, added direct links to New Relic's .EXE installers and clarified that you don't have to restart the infrastructure agent after enabling new features, such as log parsing.
* Updated dashboard [query template variable rules](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboard-template-variables/#query-variable-rules) with new guidance and specific examples.
* Updated the incorrect `hostname` to `podname` in our [Kubernetes plugin log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding) doc.
* If you've ever wanted to do a [negative lookahead with network performance monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/advanced/advanced-config/#negate-lookup), now you can.
