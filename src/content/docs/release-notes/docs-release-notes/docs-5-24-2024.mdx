### New docs

* Our new [Apache Mesos integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-mesos-integration) helps you monitor your distributed system kernel performance.
* Do you have a [.NET app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/install-guides/install-net-agent-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk)? This new install doc shows a clear path to ingesting that data to our platform.

### Major changes

* Added and updated synthetic and browser scripted monitor code examples to [synthetic monitoring best practices](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/full-stack-observability/synthetic-monitoring-best-practices-guide) and [synthetic scripted browser reference](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetic-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-chrome-100). Code examples are one of the things that are readers ask for the most, so we're always happy to see more of these.
* In our network performance monitoring docs, a lot of little updates led to a major change: updated supported environments for Podman across 17 docs.
* Clarified how [logs live archives](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives) works and when that [log data is available](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives-billing).
* Added a diagram and environment variables to Lambda monitoring [instrument your containerized image layer](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/containerized-images/).
* New Relic's REST API v1 has been fully EOLed and we deleted several docs related to it.  

### Minor changes

* Updated cloud data storage [security controls for privacy](/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/security-controls-privacy/#cloud-data-storage) with a link compliance report.
* We simplified our [.NET yum installation](/install/dotnet/installation/linuxInstall2/#yum) steps.
* Updated [Python compatibility](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent/#basic) doc to show that we now support Python 3.12.
* Updated .NET compatibility [core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core/#database) and [framework](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-framework/#database) to add that we support the `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` version 8.13.12 datastore.
* Updated [Node.js APM agent compatibilty](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent) instrumented modules table.
* Updated [AWS Privatelink](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/aws-privatelink) supported regions and zones endpoints.
* Infrastructure agent now supports Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
