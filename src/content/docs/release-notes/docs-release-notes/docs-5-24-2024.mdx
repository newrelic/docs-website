### New docs

* Our new [Apache Mesos integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-mesos-integration) helps you monitor your distributed system kernel performance.
* Our new [Temporal cloud integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/temporal-cloud-integration) helps you monitor and diagnose workflow, namespace, and scalable application issues in your Temporal Cloud.
* Do you have a [.NET app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/install-guides/install-net-agent-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk)? This new install doc shows a clear path to ingesting that data to our platform.

### Major changes

* Added and updated synthetic and browser scripted monitor code examples to [synthetic monitoring best practices](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/full-stack-observability/synthetic-monitoring-best-practices-guide) and [synthetic scripted browser reference](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetic-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-chrome-100). Code examples are one of the things that are readers ask for the most, so we're always happy to see more of these.
* In our network performance monitoring docs, a lot of little updates led to a major change: Updated supported environments for Podman across 17 docs.
* Clarified how [logs live archives](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives) works and when that [log data is available](/docs/logs/get-started/live-archives-billing).
* Added a diagram and environment variables to Lambda monitoring [instrument your containerized image layer](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/containerized-images/).
* New Relic's REST API v1 has been fully EOLed and we deleted several docs related to it.
* A massive sweep of our infrastructure monitoring docs to:
  * Align it our style guide.
  * Remove unnecessary content.
  * Make the installation doc more visible in the left nav.
  * Improve the flow of the installation doc.
* Our Developer-to-Docs site migration continues, with another 30+ docs migrated this week.
* As of May 23, 2024, AI monitoring supports Java. We've updated several AI monitoring docs to reflect this important update.

### Minor changes

* Updated cloud data storage [security controls for privacy](/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/security-controls-privacy/#cloud-data-storage) with a link compliance report.
* We simplified our [.NET yum installation](/install/dotnet/installation/linuxInstall2/#yum) steps.
* Updated [Python compatibility](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent/#basic) doc to show that we now support Python 3.12.
* Updated [.NET compatibility](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements/) to add that we support the `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` version 8.13.12 datastore.
* Updated [Node.js APM agent compatibilty](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent) instrumented modules table.
* Updated [AWS Privatelink](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/aws-privatelink) supported regions and zones endpoints.
* Infrastructure agent now supports Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat), but we don't yet support infrastructure plus logs on this version of Ubuntu.
* If you're using [CyberARK and Microsoft SQL Server](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management/#cyberark-api) with Windows Authentication, we've clarified that you need to preface your username with your domain.
* In our [.NET APM agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/#error-ignoreErrors), we've added environment variables for ignored and expected status codes.
* In [use your charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts), clarified what we mean by KB, MB, GB, and TB. (We use the International System of Units, which uses powers of 10 for calculations.)
* In [email settings](/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/account-email-settings), we've clarified allowed characters and limits on New Relic user email addresses.
* Added the IAST validator service URL endpoint to our [networks](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#new-relic-dualstack-endpoints) New Relic telemetry endpoints table.
* Added a tip on how to monitor multiple SNMP trap version on one host in [SNMP performance monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring).
* If you want to extend your [Node.js instrumentation to include Apollo Server](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs/#extend-instrumentation), we've added links to useful GitHub READMEs.
* Added .NET compatibility info to  [AI monitoring compatibility and requirements](/docs/ai-monitoring/compatibility-requirements-ai-monitoring/#compatibility).
