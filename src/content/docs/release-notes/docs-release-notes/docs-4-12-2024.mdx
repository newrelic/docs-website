  We're trying out release notes to let you know what's changing in our docs each week. This is an experiment, so [let us know via GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) if you find them helpful!
</Callout>

### New docs

* General availability for browser [session replay](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/), previously in limited preview. Check it out for deeper insights into user interactions on your websites.
* Docs on our new [Unreal Engine plugin](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-unreal-engine/monitor-your-unreal-engine-application/) to monitor Unreal Engine mobile apps, and updates to mobile agent API docs with Unreal Engine plugin methods.
* New Prometheus integration for [Prometheus Node Exporter](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/node-exporter-integration/), which lets you monitor Linux hardware and kernel metrics.

### Major changes

* Continued rewrite of on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week: [Sonarqube](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/sonarqube-monitoring-integration) and [Windows services](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/windows-services-integration).
* Added info on new mobile user journeys feature to [Crash analysis # User journeys](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-page/#user-journeys).
* AI monitoring: Added .NET agent [configuration options](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/#ai_monitoring), compatibility info ([Core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core/#large-language-models), [Framework](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-framework/#large-language-models)), and [`SetLlmTokenCountingCallback()` method](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/setllmtokencountingcallback-net-agent-api/).

### Minor changes

* Improved definition of "wall clock" time (a frequent source of questions) in APM [Transactions page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems/) doc.
* New dashboards permissions to restrict users' ability to create live chart URLs; see [Manage dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/) doc for more information.
* Clarified install steps to [Install Kubernetes on a hybrid cluster with Windows and Linux nodes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/windows-linux-hybrid-cluster/).
* Added a number of new metrics and definitions to [Google Cloud Spanner monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-spanner-monitoring-integration/).
* Removed instructions on how to [Create a drop filter](/docs/logs/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules/#create) from a query, since this feature is no longer available.
* The codemarks feature is being removed from Codestream, so we've removed codemarks-related docs and mentions.
* Reduced top margin on docs to improve readability.
