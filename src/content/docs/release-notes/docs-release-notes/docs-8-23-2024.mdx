### New docs

* [Forward your Lambda function logs with New Relic and OpenTelemetry](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/opentelemetry/otel-adot-log-ingestion-serverless) describes how to monitor AWS serverless applications with OpenTelemetry log events from AWS CloudWatch via the New Relic UI.

### Major changes

* Quality improvements to the **Explore your Kubernetes data** category, starting with [explore your Kubernetes cluster](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/kubernetes-cluster-explorer/). The improvements include content reorganization, rewritten content, and updated screenshots to improve clarity and readability.
* The .NET agent now supports auto-instrumentation of certain Lambda function types. We've updated [approaches to .NET serverless AWS Lambda performance monitoring](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-approaches-lambda/#feature-comparison) to reflect that.
* Added a new category called `Other infrastructure integrations` to split out documentation that doesn't belong in alongside our infrastructure on-host integration docs. [Atlassian Jira integration](/docs/infrastructure/other-infrastructure-integrations/atlassian-integration/) is the first doc in this new category.


### Minor changes

* In [introduction to AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda/#configure), added new sections on distributed tracing, extensions, Node.js, and Python environment variable configuration options.
* Added a link to our [collector GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector/collector.md) that describes how to set up [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel/#requirements) without our Helm chart.
* The [browser API `PageAction` event](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/addpageaction) limit has been increased from 120 to 1,000.
* Improved the clarity and readability of the [PHP agent compatibility table](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/#frameworks).
* In the logs API, log event data has a new reserved attribute name prefix of `instrumentation.*` and any attribute with this prefix is dropped during ingest. We've updated [log event data](/docs/logs/log-api/log-event-data/#attributes) to reflect this.
* We're using BugCrowd for our [coordinated disclosure program to report security vulnerabilities](/docs/security/security-privacy/information-security/report-security-vulnerabilities) and added some info about how to sign up.
* In [Fluentd plugin for log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding), to describe how we encode Japanese language log files.
