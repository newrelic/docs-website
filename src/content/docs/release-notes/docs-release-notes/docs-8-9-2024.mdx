### New docs

* We've consolidated two complicated log forwarding docs into a single one that describes how to [forward AWS logs](/install/aws-logs/), regardless of your setup. This makes it easier to find the instructions you need to set up log forwarding from AWS.
* We've consolidated two complicated log forwarding docs into a single one that describes how to [forward AWS logs](/install/aws-logs/), regardless of your setup. This makes it easier to find the instructions you need to set up log forwarding from AWS.
* [Amazon CloudWatch Application signals integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/amazon-cloudwatch-application-signals) describes how to use this integration to monitor your AWS hosted services.
* A list of the open-source libraries, their versions, and licenses we're using for [synthetic monitoring Node browser runtime](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-synthetics/new-relic-synthetics-node-browser-runtime-licenses).

### Major changes

* `Entity`, `EntityUpdate`, and strings prefixed by `Entity[0-9]` are reserved for use by New Relic. We've updated [data requirements and limits for custom event data](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/) to reflect this change.
* Our synthetic monitors support running as Mozilla Firefox. We've added information on how to use this in our [manage your synthetic monitors](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#browsers-attribute) NerdGraph tutorial and in several other places.

### Minor changes

* We ended support of our partnership API in March 2023. We deleted several docs related to this API, but we're keeping [introduction to Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api/) around to point you to how to use the NerdGraph API to do similar things.
* In [Go agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration/#expected-error-example), fixed a minor error in the example code block for handling expected errors.
* Updated system requirements in [forward your logs using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#system) to state that we support Debian version 11 (Bullseye) and 12 (Bookworm) and have dropped support for Debian version 9 (Stretch) and 10 (Buster). We've also dropped support for Windows Server 2012, following Microsoft's lead.
* In [layerless instrumentation](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-layerless/#python), fixed Python code related to importing the New Relic package into your code and adding custom events.
* In [notification message templates](/docs/alerts/get-notified/message-templates/#missing-attributes), added some additional information about how to handle missing attributes in your message template.
* Added better Dockerfile examples to [instrument your containerized function](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/containerized-images) for Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and extension-only.
* Updated and added the following [`NrAiSignal` attributes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAiSignal) to our data dictionary: `dataAccountId`, `earlyEventDropCount`, `fillOption`, `lateEventDropCount`, `removalCause`, `resetCause`, `slideBySeconds`, and
  `type`.
* Updated the Dockerfile example in [install PHP for Docker and other containers](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent/#install-same-container).
* The browser agent replaced `page_action` with `generic_events` and updated several docs to reflect this, such as [`addPageAction`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/addpageaction) and [`finished`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/finished).
