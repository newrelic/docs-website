### New docs

* [Snowflake integration with flex](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/snowflake-integration) describes how to install Snowflake dashboards and view your Snowflake data in New Relic.
* [PCI DSS](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/certificates-standards-regulations/pci-dss) contains information stating that New Relic has been evaluated according to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

### Major change

* Updated the [Certifications, standards, and regulations](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services) information for New Relic.

### Minor changes

* Added the reason for not using simple obfuscation for the New Relic CLI in [Secrets management](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).
* Updated the OS compatibility table in [Compatibility and requirements for the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/requirements-infrastructure-agent) to reflect that the infrastructure agent no longer supports version 15.2 of [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)](/docs/infrastructure-install-amazon-linux-centos-debian-rhel-or-ubuntu). 
* Updated [Non-profits and New Relic](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/eligibility-guidelines-new-relic-nonprofit-program) to reflect the change in the global validation partner for the Observability for Good program.
* Updated [Install AI monitoring](/install/ai-monitoring/?agentConfigDefault) to include a callout noting that the default value for `distributed_tracing.enabled` is set to `true` when configuring your agent for AI monitoring.
* Updated [Introduction to AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda/#recommended) to include Python 3.13 in the list of recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes.
* Updated [Configure the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent) and [Infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings) with a callout on applying configuration changes with environment variables for the infrastructure agent.
