### New docs

* A new doc on our [NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nvml-integration) describes how to use the infrastructure agent and NRI-Flex to monitor GPU usage and performance metrics.
* When Vulnerability Management is working too well, a recent update gives you the power to [ignore vulnerabilities](/docs/vulnerability-management/change-vulnerability-status) you're not concerned about.
* A massive rework of the OpenTelemetry docs category, including a new [APM: Monitor apps and services with OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro) to give you a solid place to start. Other changes:
  * Reorganized the **OpenTelemetry > Get started** category to add consistent **Overview** docs to its subcategories.
  * Renamed docs titles to clarify what's in them.
  * Consolidated related docs to make it easier to find related info.
* For people who'd rather not write regular expressions or Grok patterns to parse their logs, [query time parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/query-time-parsing) is a powerful tool for parsing logs directly in the UI. (A lot of great screenshots in this one.)

### Major changes

* Continued to rewrite the on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week: [Port](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/port-monitoring-integration) and [Unix](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/unix-monitoring-integration) monitoring integrations.
* Clarified how to manage and use [data retention rules](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention) for single- and multiple-account organizations.
* We've moved version tracking info from [error tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to [version tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/version-tracking) and made some quality-of-life improvements along the way.
* In October, 2024, we're EOLing the containerized private minion (CPM) and legacy synthetics runtime versions. In June, we're blocking the creation of new monitors using these legacy runtimes. We've added notes to this effect, like this [EOL notice](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api/#before-you-start).

### Minor changes

* In our [NerdGraph workflows tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-workflows/#update-workflow), added a GraphQL example to add a workflow name and two channels.
* Added a note that when you're [creating a custom log parsing rule](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing/#custom-parsing) you need to paste unformatted logs into the parsing UI.
* Added **View session replays** to the browser [user permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#browser) list.
* Fixed incorrect [Sonarqube config](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/sonarqube-monitoring-integration) file example.
* Added attributes to our data dictionary for the `LlmChatCompletionMessage`, `LlmChatCompletionSummary`, and `LlmEmbedding` event types.
* Added session replay capitalization guidance to our [style guide](/docs/style-guide/capitalization/product-capability-feature-usage).
* Added a stronger definition of [log parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing) to our intro paragraph.
* Added `gov-aws-api.newrelic.com` to our list of [FedRAMP-compliant endpoints](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints).
* Added a NerdGraph mutation example showing how to [rotate an Azure client secret token](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-cloud-integrations-api-tutorial/#rotate-azure-token).
* Responding to customer feedback, updated [Use your charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts) to clarify the **Numeric**, **Date**, **Duration**, and **Time to Now** chart options in the UI.
* The [errors inbox OpenTelemetry](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-errors-inbox-page) page in the UI has a new `http.response.status_code` group message value.
* Our [alerts notification message templates](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#escape) now support escape characters to help you avoid JSON-breaking characters, among other things.
* You may have noticed our code blocks are looking a lot better. We've updated many of our codeblocks with language-specific syntax highlighting so that they're prettier and easier to read.
* Updated code examples in the Python APM agent [data_source_generator](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/datasourcegenerator-python-agent-api/#example) and [register_data_source](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/registerdatasource-python-agent-api/#examples) API docs.
* Expanded our [Azure log forwarding troubleshooting](/docs/logs/forward-logs/azure-log-forwarding/#troubleshoot) help.
