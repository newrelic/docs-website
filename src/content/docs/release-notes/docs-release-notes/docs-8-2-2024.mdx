### New docs

* [Approaches to .NET serverless AWS Lambda performance monitoring](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-approaches-lambda/) aims to clarify and outline the different requirements and capabilities when setting up instrumentation for your .NET Lambda functions.
* You can monitor your [VMWare Tanzu NGINX integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/cloudfoundry-integrations/vmware-tanzu-nginx-buildpack-integration) with either .NET Core or Framework.

### Major changes

* [IAST supports Ruby](/docs/iast/introduction) in APM version 9.12.0 or higher.
* Added a new customer responsibility matrix (CRM) spreadsheet to our [FedRAMP](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/certificates-standards-regulations/fedramp/) certification doc.
* Added detailed info to [synthetics job manager configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#user-file-example) on how to mount a `PersistentVolume` for a job manager on Kubernetes.
* When you monitor your mobile app, you can disable distributed tracing as described in [configure mobile monitoring settings](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings/#configurations).
* In our [intro to Pathpoint](/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint/#flows), added new best practices info around creating flows, staging examples, and selecting relevant signals.
* Updated our [acceptable use policy](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/acceptable-use-policy/#generative-AI) to address generative AI usage.
* Clarified [.NET agent and Lambda function limitations](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-approaches-lambda/#dot-net-agent) you need to be aware of.
* Added non-ingest AWS Privatelink endpoints to [send New Relic data via AWS PrivateLink](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/aws-privatelink).
* A thorough clean-up of [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements) makes it much easier for you to understand and find the system compatibiliy and requirements information you need to know.

### Minor changes

* Updated the [infrastructure agent configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#status-server-enabled) to note that if you install the infrastructure agent via guided install, our CLI installer, then `status` is enabled by default.
* Finished adding all of the status colors in [introduction to New Relic pathpoint](/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint/#touchpoint-status)
* We've got new infrastructure UI experiences for [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/#insights), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/understand-use-data-infrastructure-integrations/#explore), and [GCP](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations/#insights), and updated docs to match.
* Updated compatibility for [.NET core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core) and [.NET Framework](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-framework).
* In [Microsoft SQL Server](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/microsoft-sql/microsoft-sql-server-integration/#enable-microsoft-sql-server), it turns out that `VIEW ANY DEFINITION` is the correct name for read access permissions.
* When you [export a chart as CSV](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#export-charts-csv), if you have comments in your NRQL query, you may see unexpected results in the CSV.
* If your synthetic monitoring scripts are running in an environment with write protected directories and you need to [import and store Node.js modules](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/introduction-scripted-browser-monitors/#importing), prepend these paths to appropriate the filenames.
* Custom event names can include forward slashes, so we've updated [data requirements and limits for custom event data](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#general) to reflect that.
* Added the `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER` environment variable to the [introduction to AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda/#environment). This is used by our handler wrapper to find your function's actual handler.
* The Java APM agent isn't compatible with the latest version of Kafka. We've updated [compatibility and requirements for the Java agent](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent/#http-messaging) to reflect that we support versions 2.0.0 to 3.6.x.
* Added a note to [requirements for the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#os) to let that if you're running the infrastructure agent on Windows 2012, the highest available version is 1.37.1.
* Updated our APM agent docs to clarify that distributed tracing is enabled by default with our agents, but you need to enable Infinite Tracing.
