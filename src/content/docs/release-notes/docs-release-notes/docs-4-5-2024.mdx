  We're trying out release notes to let you know what's changing in our docs each week. This is an experiment, so [let us know via GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) if you find them helpful!
</Callout>

### New docs

* How to guide on using the [OpenTelemetry collector to monitor SingleStore metrics](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/collector-configuration-examples/opentelemetry-collector-singlestore).

### Major changes

* Synthetic monitoring job manager docs now describe how to configure [user-defined variables for scripted monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration) and what [job manager version](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide) supports doing so.
* Continued rewrite of on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week: [Sonarqube](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/sonarqube-monitoring-integration) and [Windows services](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/windows-services-integration).
* Cross application tracing is deprecated and won't be supported in future APM agent versions. We updated the docs to reflect this.
* Removed docs related to OpenTelemetry cumulative metrics, which was deprecated in 2023.

### Minor changes

* Updated API docs links related to Node.js [AI monitoring customization](/docs/ai-monitoring/customize-agent-ai-monitoring).
* Clarified which [Data Plus features](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-prices) apply to Standard, Pro, and Enterprise accounts.
* Clarified that when you [update the Java APM agent](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent) and are using one of our [Java agent APIs](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/api-guides/guide-using-java-agent-api), you need to update the API dependencies as well.
* Updated Python APM agent version support to 9.8.0 (from 9.9.0) to monitor [AI libraries and frameworks](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent/#digital-intelligence-platform).
* Updated link to ServiceNow in [destination notification](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations) instructions.
* Our infrastructure agent now collects all [EC2 node container metrics from the Docker API](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/container-instrumentation-infrastructure-monitoring) with Cgroup version V2 when monitoring an Elastic container service.
* Updated information about how to [find OpenTelemetry `singlestore` data](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/collector-configuration-examples/opentelemetry-collector-singlestore/#view-data) in the UI.
* Updated CodeStream docs related to [log search](/docs/codestream/observability/log-search) and [performance monitoring](/docs/codestream/observability/performance-monitoring).
* Added a link to the [Java agent user attributes](/docs/errors-inbox/error-users-impacted) supported by errors inbox.
* When [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/queries-nrql_screenshot-full_nrql-alert-conditions/#condition-tips) aggregate data to be evaluated, they can now evaluate data in time increments from 30 seconds up to six hours.
