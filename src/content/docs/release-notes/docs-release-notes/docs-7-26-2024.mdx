### New docs

* In [OpenTelemetry examples](/docs/style-guide/writing-strategies/opentelemetry-examples), we describe our approach to documenting OpenTelemetry across our docs site and the [`newrelic-opentelemetry` examples repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main).
* A new doc on [AWS multi-account observability](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-multi-account) gives you all the information you need to set New Relic up with two or more AWS accounts.
* [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel) describes how to monitor a Kubernetes cluster via OpenTelemetry and then send that data to New Relic. This is a preview feature.
* [Manage OpenTelemetry data ingest volume](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-manage-data-ingest-volume) provides advice on how to monitor and manage your data ingest.
* In order to simplify and clarify what you need to do to [forward your AWS logs](/install/aws-logs/), we've combined multiple docs on this topic into a single, interactive doc that helps you get the specific instructions you need for your system.

### Major changes

* Update to [install the browser agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent) clarifies the four different installation methods you can use.
* With a recent relaunch of Pathpoint, we've made significant updates to related docs, but especially [introduction to New Relic Pathpoint](/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint) and [install Pathpoint](/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/install-pathpoint).
* Updated [PHP agent installation: Ubuntu and Debian](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-debian) to remove `apt-key` due to the way it compromises trust in package signing.

### Minor changes

* Update to [login and password issues](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#social-login-error) give you some info on what to do when your social login fails.
* Updated the screenshot at the top of [get started with infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/) to match the current UI.
* Removed invalid `webelement` methods from [synthetic scripted browser reference (Chrome 100 and higher)](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetic-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-chrome-100). (Updated in response to what's shown in the [Selenium \`WebElement](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/WebElement.html) class definition.)
* Clarified in [compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent) that New Relic typically ends supports for a Node.js version 2-4 months after [the published EOL date](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
* In [infrastructure inventory UI page](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), added note that APM metadata is created in the ingest pipeline when infrastructure and APM agents are running on the same host.
* In [import, export, add, and share dashboards and charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#export-pdf-limitations) added a section describing some of the limitations when exporting a dashboard to PDF.
* Clarified reduce data ingest and metrics in [OpenTelemetry for Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-otel). Also, added a new diagram.
* Microsoft dropped support Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 on October 10, 2023. We've updated [requirements for the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent) to reflect that.
* Updated the video on [intro to logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context/).
* Updated "do not translate" `<DNT>` tags across our site to improve the translation accuracy of UI and non-UI text strings.
* CentOS Stream 8 has been EOLed, so we've updated [requirements for the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#os) to reflect that.
