### New docs

* Consolidated scores of OpenTelemetry docs into a single [OpenTelemetry APM UI](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-apm-ui) doc.
* [Collector for Confluent Cloud and Kafka monitoring](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-kafka-confluentcloud-k8s) helps you collect OpenTelemetry Kafka metrics so that you can monitor it with New Relic.
* [Linkerd integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/linkerd-integration) is a service mesh for Kubernetes, making it easier to run services, providing runtime debugging and observability without making changes to your code.

### Major changes

* Quality rewrites to the following OpenTelemtry docs:
  * [OpenTelemetry traces in New Relic](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-traces)
  * [OpenTelemetry metrics in New Relic](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-metrics)
  * [OpenTelemetry logs in New Relic](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs)
* When creating custom dashboards, you can build them with [variables from different data types](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboard-template-variables/#from-data-types).
* Added a new, five-minute video to [query time parsing in logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/query-time-parsing) to help you get started parsing your logs directly in the UI.

### Minor changes

* Updated three .NET agent docs, such as [Install the .NET agent on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/install-guides/install-net-agent-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk), to include a link to our [.NET agent samples repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-examples/tree/main/elastic-beanstalk), so that you can see some working examples.
* Added Ruby environment variables to [AWS Lambda serverless monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/configure-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda) and [containerized images](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/containerized-images) (includes an updated diagram).
* Added a note to [OpenAI integration](/docs/mlops/integrations/openai-integration) that you're better off using [AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring/) if you want to monitor the performance of an OpenAI app.
* If you don't define an [entity expiration time](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#expiration), the default is eight days. We've updated the docs to reflect this.
* Added a note that [read only permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) don't apply to dashboards, which have their own [dashboard permission settings](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions).
* You can use NRQL to [query time ranges in milliseconds](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/query-time-range/#relative-time-n-units-ago) now.
* Added new IP ranges to [data ingest IP blocks](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#ingest-blocks) and [user-facing domains](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#user-facing-domains).
* Cleaned up the content in [Atlassian Jira integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/atlassian/atlassian-integration) to make it easier to use.
* Updated latest supported versions in the [Node.js instrumented modules](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/#instrument) table.
* Added new iOS background reporting section to [configure mobile monitoring settings](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings/#ios-background-reporting).
* Completed a clarity and quality improvement edit of [browser monitoring and the Rube agent](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/features/new-relic-browser-ruby-agent).
* Updated the [Ruby agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration) with changes related to the v.9.10.0 release.
* Removed an old and no longer wanted OpenTelemetry troubleshooting doc.
