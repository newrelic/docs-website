### New docs

* [AWS Application Migration Service integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-application-migration-service-integration) describes how to keep track of services you've migrated to AWS.
* [Browser SPA monitoring 2.0](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/browser-spa-v2) is an update that addresses several known issues and provide an improved monitoring experience for single-page applications. 

### Major changes

* Added a new section describing how to [set up AWS cross-account access](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-multi-account/#setting-up-aws-cross-account-access) with New Relic.
* Added information about how to [link your applications to Kubernetes](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/#link-app), using either New Relic's or OpenTelemetry's instrumentation.
* On [template variables: dynamically filter dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboard-template-variables/#include-variable), added information on how to include and exclude variables in order to focus your dashboard visualizations on the data you're most concerned about.
* Updated several screenshots and added information about default and custom [chart refresh rates](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/chart-refresh-rates).

### Minor changes

* Added the `BYPASS_HEAD_REQUEST` description to [NerdGraph tutorial: Manage your synthetic monitors](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial).
* Clarified how to use the UI installation for [Flutter application monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-flutter/monitor-your-flutter-application) and addressed some minor inconsistencies.
* Added a note to [stream logs using Kinesis Data Firehose](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose) to let you know that this AWS logs integration is not FedRAMP authorized.
* [Scripted monitor proxy usage](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/set-proxy-settings-properties-scripted-monitors) is supported and requires Firefox version 3.0.7 or higher.
* Updated [logging best practices](/docs/logs/get-started/logging-best-practices/#partitions) to provide some new guidance around data partitions.

* Added and updated screenshots on [Kubernetes summary page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page).
* We support the Java Regex syntax in our [logs parsing](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing/#how-it-works) UI.
* Added a note that we've deprecated the browser monitoring [`createTracer` SPA API method](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/createtracer) and the [`BrowserTiming` custom event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring).
* The [.NET agent](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements/#app-frameworks) supports Oracle versions 23.4.0 to 23.5.1 (the latest verified compatible version).
* Based on customer feedback, we've clarified how to use [`newrelic_notice_error` (PHP agent API)](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/php-agent-api/newrelic_notice_error).
