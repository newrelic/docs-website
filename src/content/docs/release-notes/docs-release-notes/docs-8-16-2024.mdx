### New docs

* [Create "host not reporting" NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/create-nrql-host-not-reporting-conditions) describes how to set up alerting for a loss of signal.


### Major changes

* Improved our installation and configuration steps in [introduction to AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/instrument-lambda-function/introduction-lambda/#setup) to make it easier to see how your Lambda functions are performing in our UI.
* We've got a new [end-of-life announcements](/eol/) section in our docs to make it easier for you to keep track of what's scheduled for end of life. It also includes an RSS feed for your convenience.

### Minor changes

* Updated [version compatibility information](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/cloudfoundry-integrations/vmware-tanzu-nginx-buildpack-integration/#requirements-compatibility) for our NGINX integration buildpack for VMware Tanzu.
* When forwarding logs with our [infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#system), we now support Ubuntu version 24.04.x (LTS version).
* We've deprecated pre-built alerts in our UI install flow and updated various docs to reflect that.
