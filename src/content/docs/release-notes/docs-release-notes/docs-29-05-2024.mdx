### New docs

* [Logging with the iOS agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/ios-remote-logging/) ensures consistent and comprehensive logging throughout the project, the iOS agent provides logging APIs. Use the agent's logging APIs to send your mobile apps logs to New Relic. 
* [Introducing One-Step Kubernetes with APM auto-attach](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-agent-operator) which was formerly known as the Kubernetes agent operator now streamlines full-stack observability for Kubernetes environments by automating APM instrumentation alongside Kubernetes agent deployment.

### Major changes

* Updated the version support information (under prerequisites section) about the [service broker for TAS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/other-infrastructure-integrations/cloudfoundry-integrations/vmware-tanzu-service-broker-integration/)
* The synthetic job manager now supports Podman container environment. [Refer synthetic job manager to learn more about Podman.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager/)

### Minor change

* [Updated the End of Life support date](https://docs.newrelic.com/eol/2024/04/eol-04-24-24-polling-api/) for Azure SQL database. Azure is deprecating the SDK the polling API uses and will no longer be providing critical updates to this API, creating security concerns moving forward.
