### New docs

* We've got a new [Atlassian integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/atlassian/atlassian-integration) so people can sync issues and incidents created in New Relic with Atlassian Jira.
* Our new [best practices for integration users](/docs/more-integrations/best-practices-integration) doc gives advice to New Relic administrators when integrating third-party systems with our platform, specifically as it relates to security.
* A new doc on the [Amazon S3 Storage Lens](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-s3-storagelens-monitoring-integration) integration describes how to connect this service to New Relic.

### Major changes

* We've overhauled our [Micrometer](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/micrometer/micrometer-metrics-registry) doc with clear, procedural steps to ingest data via the OpenTelemetry Micrometer bridge.
* As part of our Developer-to-Docs site migration project, we've migrated content related to custom visualizations, NerdGraph, and the CLI, among others.
* Updated [.NET agent compatibility requirements](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core) for several supported frameworks.

### Minor changes

* We've updated "timeseries" to "time series" across the docs site. This brings it inline with our [usage dictionary](/docs/style-guide/word-choice/usage-dictionary/#time-series).
* Updated browser limitations for `noticeError` to clarify that if an error is caught and re-thrown it won't have a stack trace and info on how to address that. (For Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer only.)
* Added optional runtime related fields to broken link, certificate check, and step monitors to our [NerdGraph synthetics tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial). These help you create monitors that take advantage of our newer synthetics runtimes and private job managers.
* Added info about using `ENABLE_WASM` and `synthetics.enableWasm` to enable Webassembly for Node Browser Runtime.
* Added a new section about how [browser session replay](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/#data-security) complies with data privacy laws.
* Added a link to our [2024 State of the Java Ecosystem](https://newrelic.com/resources/report/2024-state-of-the-java-ecosystem) report to our [introduction to the Java agent](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java).
* When installing [Kubernetes for the OpenShift container platform](/install/kubernetes), there are specific security constraints that we've now addressed in our docs.
* We have removed an out-of-date browser troubleshooting doc to ensure accuracy.
* We restructured our [Containerized private minion configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration) docs to help customers customize their CPMs.
* We [clarified how metrics are displayed](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#trim_stats) when `trim_stats` is set to `false`.
