### New docs

* We consolidated all of the errors inbox mobile crash docs into a single [mobile group crashes tab](/docs/errors-inbox/mobile-tab).
* New [analyze model data](/docs/ai-monitoring/explore-ai-data/view-model-data) describes the different ways you can use AI monitoring to observe your model performance.
* New [Google VertexAI monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-vertexai-monitoring-integration) describes how to activate the integration and start monitoring it.
* New [NVIDIA Jetson integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nvidia-jetson-integration) describes how to monitor your NVIDIA Jetson device.

### Major changes

* In our Python agent configuration, added [`STARTUP_DEBUG`](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_DEBUG) info.
* In [mobile monitoring configuration settings](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings/#android-background-reporting), added enable and disable info for background and `ApplicationExitInfo` reporting for Android.
* A massive overhaul of the alerts navigation more clearly maps out your user journey through alerts creation, configuration, management, and use.

### Minor changes

* Aligned the structure of [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/app-launch-times-ios-apps) and [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-app-launch-time-android-apps) app launch time docs in response to customer feedback, which suggested we make them more similar.
* [Infrastructure logs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent) now support Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
* Updated [Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent), [.NET core](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-core), and [.NET framework](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-framework) compatibility.
* In our AI monitoring installation guide, added [Java agent configuration](/install/ai-monitoring/?agent-lang=java) and other quality-of-life improvements.
* Added [AWS PrivateLink](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/aws-privatelink/#us-endpoints-use1) New Relic REST API endpoint.
* Our [Oracle database integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/oracle-database-monitoring-integration/#comp-req) now supports up to version 23.
* Our [HAProxy integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/haproxy-monitoring-integration) now supports up to version 3.x.
* Clarified that the [.NET agent](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/net-agent-compatibility-requirements-net-framework/#unavailable-features) requires just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which means that it doesn't support Native Ahead of Time (AOT) deployment.
* Added new instructions on how to [expose Linkerd integration metrics](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/linkerd-integration/#expose-linkerd-metrics).
* Updated a screenshot on [Atlassian Jira integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/atlassian/atlassian-integration/#different-organization) to show new Jira UI.
* Added [synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/monitor-private-locations/#minion-status) private location job manager endpoints.
* Updated the style of the codeblocks in [.NET agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration).
