### New docs

* Mobile monitoring's [application not responding](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/application-not-responding) feature helps you track and analyze when and why your Android application's blocked for more than five seconds.
* New browser monitoring [`log()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/log) and [`wrapLogger()`](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/wraplogger) API docs define the syntax, requirements, parameters, and examples on how to use these new endpoints.

### Major changes

* We've removed our top-level `Other capabilities` category and migrated everything that was there into more appropriate categories. With everything in its right place, it's easier for you to find what you're looking for.
* Moved the OpenTelemetry collector examples on our docs site to our  `newrelic-opentelemetry-examples`]([https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples)) GitHub repository to make maintenance easier and improve their open-source visibility.
* Our AI monitoring supports [NVIDIA NIM models](/docs/ai-monitoring/compatibility-requirements-ai-monitoring/#deploy-at-scale) and doesn't require any extra configuration outside of our manual or UI-based installation flows. Read more about it in our blog [AI monitoring for NVIDIA NIM](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/ai-monitoring-for-nvidia-nim).

### Minor changes

* Added IAST validator service URL endpoints to [FedRAMP compliant endpoints](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/fedramp-compliant-endpoints/#agents) and [networks](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/#new-relic-endpoints).
* Updated [IAST troubleshooting](/docs/iast/troubleshooting/#see-my-application) with specific IP ranges to whitelist if you're not seeing your application.
* Updated [Ruby agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#instrumentation-aws_sqs) with `NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_AWS_SQS` auto-instrumentation configuration information.
* Removed `ApplicationExitInfo` reporting configuration information from [configure mobile monitoring settings](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings), because you can do this in the UI.
* [Workflow enrichments](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) support multiple variables so you can customize your data more specifically ot your needs.
* Added the [MobileApplicationExit](/attribute-dictionary/?dataSource=Mobile&event=MobileApplicationExit) attribute to our data dictionary. Our data dictionary isn't only a docs resource, but it also feeds attribute definitions directly to the UI, for example when you're writing NRQL queries in our query builder.
* Removed docs related to the outdated alerts REST API.
