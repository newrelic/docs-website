  We're trying out release notes to let you know what's changing in our docs each week. This is an experiment, so [let us know via GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) if you find them helpful!
</Callout>

### Major changes

* Continued rewrite of on-host integration docs to make it easier to install and ensure the docs are accurate and up to date. Up this week: [Ray integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/ray-integration) and [NGINX](/install/nginx).
* Removed docs related to a deprecated anomaly detection feature.
* Updated [Ruby agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration) for version 9.9.0, including `thread_local_tracer_state` and serverless mode.
* Reorganized our OpenTelemetry docs and moved the category to the top-level nav.
* Removed section on setting up Freshservice alerts notification integration, because we no longer support it.

### Minor changes

* Updated section title to [average errors over the past 30 minutes by appName](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/rate-function/#average-appname-errors) to match query example.
* Reorganized [drop filter rules](/docs/logs/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules/#create) to make it more clear that you can use two methods: from an attribute and from scratch.
* When you want to use NRQL's [`getField()`](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-metric-data-type/#use-getfield) function to see what fields are available to query in your metric data, we've clarified when you'd want to use `getField(metricName, field)` versus the shorthand syntax `metricName[field]`.
* In our synthetrics NerdGraph tutorial, added example to [query existing monitor downtimes](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#downtime-query).
* Updated [Java APM agent compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent) to clarify that you can use Kafa Clients for metrics data and distributed tracing, but not events data.
* Updated our [OpenTelemetry collector host monitoring example](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-infra-hosts/#host-receiver) to match OpenTelemetry's example repository.
* Updated [synthetics job manager version requirements table](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/#requirements): custom node modules require job manager version release-363.
* Updated to state that you can run [NRQL queries via CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/what-is-codestream).
* Added info about adding secure URL and custom headers authentication when using [alerts notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).
* We've changed our [GCP primitive role recommendation](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/integrations-custom-roles/#recommended) to `Viewer` for GCP integrations.
* The minimum allowed size of [log entries/lines in KB](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#max_line_kb) is `33`.
* The [Go agent](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-compatibility-requirements/#digital-intelligence-platform) supports Go OpenAI library versions 1.19.4 and above.
* Edited [Apache Druid integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-druid-integration) doc with quality of life and readability improvements.
* Clarified that [session replay](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay) is still in limited preview.
