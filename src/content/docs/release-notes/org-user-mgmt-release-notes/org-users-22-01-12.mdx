## New version of New Relic One pricing model with core users

We released a new version of the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) with a new [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): the core user. Organizations on this pricing version have access to three user types: basic users, core users, and full platform users. The core user has more access than basic users and costs less than a full platform user. Core users have access to some powerful developer-centric features like New Relic CodeStream, our logs UI, and the ability to build New Relic One apps. 

This pricing version also [calculates billable users differently](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-count) and has [different user downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing/#user-downgrade-rules). 

For more about this release and about availability, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).
