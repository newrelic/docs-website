## Removal of estimated cost in May of 2022

In May of 2022, we removed the current month's estimated cost from the usage UI and from usage-related events. We did this to avoid confusion in cases where the estimated cost differs from the actual cost. Details on this change:
* **Removal of estimated cost from the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-ui).** The usage UI shows your usage and show invoices, as always, but there won't be an estimated cost for the current month. 
* **Removal of `estimatedCost` attribute.** This attribute is being removed from the events `NrMTDConsumption` and `NrConsumption`. 

For tips on how to run queries to return an estimated cost, or on how to replace existing queries that use `estimatedCost`, see [Estimated cost queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts#estimated-cost).

Note that viewing and editing billing settings requires the [**Billing user** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles).
