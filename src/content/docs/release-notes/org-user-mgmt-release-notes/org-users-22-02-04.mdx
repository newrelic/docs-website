New Relic One platform users who are managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) could previously only set their time zone via their identity provider (IdP).

Now all users can override these time zone preferences by updating them in New Relic One. This is especially useful for customers with IdPs that cannot send time zone preferences to New Relic.

To do this, simply visit your user preferences and update your time zone. We'll automatically save your new preference and override what is being sent via your identity provider.

For more details, see the [time zone setting docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/default-time-zone-setting).
