We released the ability to export user data from the **User management** UI. The data is exportable via TSV. Exportable columns include users’ names, email addresses, current user type, groups, and user ID. Admins can choose to export all users or select a subset of users.

For more details, see [Export user list](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks).
