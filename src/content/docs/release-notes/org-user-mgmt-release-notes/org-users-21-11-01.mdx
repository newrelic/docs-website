## Automated user management now available for Pro edition

New Relic's [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) feature is now available to organizations with New Relic's [Pro edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). Previously this was available only to organizations with Enterprise edition.

Automated user management allows you to use SCIM provisioning to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from an identity provider, like Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin. You can also manage attributes about your users, including user type and time zone, via your identity provider.
