Managing your users' access to New Relic just got easier. We've enhanced the [**Access management** UI page](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) to be more group-focused. Now you can more quickly understand what roles and accounts your groups have access to, create groups, and edit group access.

We've also simplified how you manage higher-level administrative features. We previously had separate organization-scoped roles for these capabilities. Now, organization-level administrative settings (like billing, organization settings, and authentication domain settings) can be easily assigned to a group from the **Groups** UI page.

To learn more:
