We changed the location of some [authentication domain](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) settings. Changes include: 

* We placed the **Authentication domains** UI in the [**Administration** UI menu](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#where).
* We moved the user session settings and the user upgrade settings to the **User management** UI page.
