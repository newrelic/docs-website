Our System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) API now supports management of users' [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). This allows Enterprise customers on the New Relic One user model to manage user type via their identity provider (IdP) or any custom integration that supports SCIM. This is particularly useful for provisioning users as either basic or full (instead of always provisioning users as full), along with automatically upgrading and downgrading within the New Relic [billing policy](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#user-count) of two downgrades per user per rolling twelve months.

The release includes [a SCIM tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/tutorial-manage-users-groups-scim) and the ability for admins to add a custom message and/or URL to the self-upgrade page that communicates the customer-specific upgrade request process for customers that manage user type through the API.

We have instructions for enabling this with our pre-built [Okta integration](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/okta-scimsso-application-configuration/). Currently we don't have step-by-step instructions for our OneLogin or Azure AD integrations. If you're using one of these, you'll need to configure your identity provider to send a new attribute, [`nrUserType`](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/scim-support-automated-user-management/#user-type).
