## Task Updates

* A new command line option `-ac-agents-namespace` was added for specifying a namespace for Agent Control agents ([#243](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli/pull/243)). The following tasks have been updated to use the new namespace:
  * K8s/Resources/Config
  * K8s/Resources/Daemonset
  * K8s/Resources/Deploy
  * K8s/Resources/Pods

## Fixes

* GLIBC related errors such as `/lib64/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.34' not found` have been resolved ([#244](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli/pull/244)).
