## Changes
* Infra/Log/Collect and Infra/Log/LogLevelCheck  - Updated to support new configuration options available for the Infrastructure agent
* DotNetCore/Agent/Installed - Updated to support new install location of the .NET agent
* DotNetCore/Env/Versions - Updated to use `dotnet --info` for determine what versions of .NET Core are installed. If that fails, it will fall back on `dotnet --version`, then if both of those commands fail, it will look for the .NET Core installation directories
