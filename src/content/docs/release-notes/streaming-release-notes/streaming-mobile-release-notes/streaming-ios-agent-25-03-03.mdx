## Impact and actions required

- **Transition from MobileVideo**: Users currently tracking `MobileVideo` events should adapt their implementations to utilise the newly introduced event types. This change provides improved specificity and scope in tracking actions across video interactions.
- **Update Implementations**: Integrators should update their systems to leverage new attributes introduced with the release, which provide richer context and detail for event tracking.
- **Testing & Validation**: We recommend testing the implementation of new attributes and event types to ensure compatibility and correct data transmission.
