## Notes

* Adds a feature to ignore extension startup checks using the Lambda environment variable `NEW_RELIC_IGNORE_EXTENSION_CHECKS`. You can ignore selected extension checks by using a comma-separated value. For example, `agent,handler` will ignore agent and handler extension checks. Use `all` to ignore all extension checks. We recommended you ignore `all` extension checks after you've successfully instrumented the Lambda function.

* Updates information about environment variable `NR_TAGS` in the Readme. You can use `NR_TAGS` to add tags to all the Lambda log events.

* Introduces support for the `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED` environment variable which you can use to disable Agent. The `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED` has the `env bool` type.

## Fixed issue

* Fixed docker handler warning issue for containerized lambda.
