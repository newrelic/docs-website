## Notes

* Removed unnecessary trace logging for skipped `Function` and `Extension` logs.

* Updated parsing logic to scan the first 50 characters instead of a 100-byte slice. Ensuring safe handling of multi-byte `UTF-8 characters` (like emojis) without truncation errors.

## Fixed

* Resolved an issue where requests were occasionally not instrumented in APM mode.

* Enabled automatic `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` fallback.
