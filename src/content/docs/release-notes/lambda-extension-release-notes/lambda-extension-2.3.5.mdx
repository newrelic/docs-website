## Notes

* Adds support to customize the duration of retry attempts to send payload data to New Relic using the environmental variable `NEW_RELIC_DATA_COLLECTION_TIMEOUT`. This gives you more control
over the expected runtime of your application. Note that the extension may need to send more than one payload. The value of this timeout can be any
valid Golang duration string. For example, 10s = 10 seconds;
500ms = 500 milliseconds; 1m = 1 minute. See https://pkg.go.dev/maze.io/x/duration#ParseDuration for more info. The default timeout value is 10s.
