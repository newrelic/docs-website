### Notes

Our new APM memory / threads section now works with Java & Elixir agents!

### Improvements

* Additional information for Java instances and Elixir hosts in the APM application detail section.
* New host / instance drop down for APM applications showing summary information, and allowing you to filter the APM page to a specific host or instance.
* Update to the Mobile APM summary page, so that some edge cases will now load.
