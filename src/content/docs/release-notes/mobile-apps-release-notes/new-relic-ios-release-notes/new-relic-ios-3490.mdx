### Notes

Synchronizes app favorites with New Relic for a consistent way to get access to those APM apps, Browser apps, Mobile apps, and synthetic monitors wherever you might be.

### Improvements

* Uses the same data source for favorites as New Relic One
* Merges any iPhone / iPad specific favorites into your New Relic One favorites
* Updates Apdex charts to zoom in on the y axis to better show smaller variations
* Update Transaction trace bar to closer match the web in some edge cases

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where searching in the APM Error attributes or stack traces would result in strange behavior
* Fixes an issue in the host / instance popup where the web response time was off by an order of magnitude
