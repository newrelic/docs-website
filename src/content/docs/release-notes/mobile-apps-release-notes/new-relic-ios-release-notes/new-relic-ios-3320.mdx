### Notes

As enterprises adopt more scalable microservice architectures, it becomes more difficult to pinpoint performance issues within the application stack. New Relic’s new health map feature brings together insights on application and infrastructure performance into a single, prioritized view. This unified view enables operations and DevOps teams to quickly understand if the source of a performance issue is from the application code or in the infrastructure layer.
