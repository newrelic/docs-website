## New

### Adds configurable request header instrumentation to network events

The agent will now produce network event attributes for select header values if the headers are detected on the request. The header names to instrument are passed into the agent when started.

For more information, see [Adding Tracked Headers](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/add-tracked-headers) in the Mobile Monitoring documentation.

### Adds GraphQL attributes to network events

If the agent detects request headers from Apollo GraphQL servers, it will add additional attributes to the network request event.

For more information, see [Adding Tracked Headers](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/add-tracked-headers) in the Mobile Monitoring documentation.

### Exclude instrumentation by package name

The agent plugin can now be configured to exclude classes from a specific package space during instrumentation. These classes will be unmodified. This feature can be useful when encountering sensitive or problematic class data.

For more information, see [Configure the New Relic Gradle plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-new-relic-gradle-plugin/).

## Fixed

* Exclude signed jars from instrumentation
