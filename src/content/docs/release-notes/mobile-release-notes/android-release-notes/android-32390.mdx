### Fixes

* Call checkcast before invoking NR instrumentation.

  This fixes an issue where the Dalvik VM refuses to load a class with our instrumentation in cases where the inbound object is not the expected type as determined by static code analysis.
* Don't attempt to instrument constructors in subclasses of classes we normally instrument.

  While we support instrumenting constructors by replacing the call to , we don't support doing this in subclasses. For now, we ignore these cases but may return to adding inline instrumentation to constructors in the future.
* Java 7u60 (pre-release) refactored the class in which we were storing our invocation dispatcher.

  We've future proofed the agent by storing the dispatcher in another core class.
