## New

* Added the ability to persist events when application is force killed.
* Added the ability to store harvest data that previously would be lost if the application doesn't have internet connection. These harvest are then sent after an internet connection is established and the next harvest successfully uploads. This feature is disabled by default, see more details [here](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/configure-settings/#android-offline-storage) to enable it.
* Added [`setMaxOfflineStorageSize`](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/set-max-offline-storage/#android) API to set the maximum amount of data that can be stored locally.
* Added support for Unreal platform.
* Added support for Android dynamic features.

## Fix

* Fixed an issue that target activity is not captured when calculating app launch time from the start to a target activity rather than the default main activity.
