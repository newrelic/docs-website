## Fixed

* Fixed an issue of missing element in harvest payload, which has caused data loss during ingest in version [6.9.1](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-691)
* Tightened metric data validations to prevent data loss during ingest
* Fixed a bug that allowed direct access to the agent plugin extension's configuration from Kotlin that could result in a failure to tag and upload obfuscation maps.
