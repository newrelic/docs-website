## New in this release
* Add support for reporting app launch time, including cold time and hot time.
	- Cold start time refers to an app’s starting from scratch. This means that the app’s process has not been created by the system until then.
	- Hot start time refers to when your app’s process is already running in the background.


## Fixed in this release
* Fixed an instrumentation race condition when build is run with multiple Gradle workers (--max-workers > 2)
* Fixed a crash when trying to report exceptions with missing stacktraces through supportability metrics.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.27.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5270).
