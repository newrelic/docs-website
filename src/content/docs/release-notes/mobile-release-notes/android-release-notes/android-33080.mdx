### Improvements

* New API methods for adding cross application tracing headers to noticeHttpTransaction().

  In case the New Relic agent doesn't support the HTTP API you're using, you can manually submit a transaction via the noticeHttpTransaction() method. With this release, this method now allows you to set the NR cross application tracing header for tracking purposes.

### Fixes

* Fixed a rare build crash where newly constructed objects go unused and are later optimized down by ProGuard.
