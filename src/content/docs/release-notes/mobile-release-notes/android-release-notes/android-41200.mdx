### Improvements

* You can now disable the capture of the HTTP response body for requests by calling `NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.HttpResponseBodyCapture)`.
* You can now disable crash reporting by calling `NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.CrashReporting)`.
* The SDK was updated to accept the HTTP method in `NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction()` and `NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure()` allowing more detailed information to be collected.

### Fixes

* Resolves an issue related to recording a URL that could have potentially resulted in a Null Pointer Exception.
