### Improvements

* New API method for configuring logging verbosity.

  You can now choose how verbose the agent will be at boot by chaining withLogLevel() before your NewRelic start() call. The default level is INFO.
* New API method for renaming inflight interactions.

  Call NewRelic.setInteractionName() at the beginning of your onCreate() method to set a custom name for your interaction. This usually defaults to the name of the Activity subclass.
* Method tracing optimizations.

  Weâ€™ve carefully reviewed the code involved in tracing instrumented methods and reduced its CPU and memory overhead substantially.
