Welcome to the New Relic Android agent version 6.0. This major release breaks compatibility with older 2.x and early 3.x versions of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP).

## New in this release

### Adds Distributed Tracing support

The agent will now add Distributed Tracing headers to instrumented network requests. This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled through the `DistributedTracing` feature flag.

Refer to [How New Relic distributed tracing works](docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#no-sampling) for more information on Distributed Tracing in mobile apps.

### Exclude variants from instrumentation

Variant builds can now be selectively excluded from instrumentation during builds.
Build types or product flavors are excluded through the [New Relic Gradle plugin extension](docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-new-relic-gradle-plugin/):

```
newrelic {
    // do not instrument these build variants
    excludeVariantInstrumentation("debug", "chocolateRelease")
}
```

### Updated requirements

The minimum supported SDK level (minSdkVersion) is now 24 (Android 7.0)
The minimum supported Android Gradle plugin version is now 3.4 using Gradle 5.1.1 or higher.

## Fixed in this release

* Bluetooth and ethernet connections are now correctly identified.

* Fix build crash involving manifestPlaceholder replacement when used with AGP 4.1.

* Remove unused compile dependency on the `support-v4` Android support library .

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.22.1](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5221).
