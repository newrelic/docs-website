## New

* Adds support for DexGuard 9+ with Gradle 8/AGP 8

* Adds map parameters for both custom and auto HTTP instrumentation to ensure data accuracy
* Decouple map tagging with uploads in plugin to improve the build pipeline by making the tagged map a cachable build artifact

## Fixed

* Fix NoClassDefFoundError when using agent v7.0.0 due to uninstrumented signed libraries
* Fix an issue that excludeVariantInstrumention is not accepting camel case variant names

As of this release, the oldest supported version is [6.3.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-630).
