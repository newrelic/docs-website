## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the `NewRelicNavigationObserver` would crash when handling routes without a key parameter, such as bottom sheets and modal dialogs.
- Resolved navigation tracking failures for routes that don't extend `PageRoute`.

## Enhancements
- Improved type safety in `NewRelicNavigationObserver` by removing all dynamic types.
- Added support for additional route types including `CupertinoPage` and `NoTransitionPage` from `go_router`.
- Refactored navigation observer code for better maintainability and readability.
