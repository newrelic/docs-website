## Fixed in this release

* Swift symbol upload script.
* Cold and Hot App Launch Time Metrics are now reported automatically. Note: Warm and prewarmed times are not reported.
* Fix a bug where install metrics were not sent in all cases.

### Other notes

* Deprecation notice: This version introduces a new Swift symbol upload script. See installation instructions for details on how to update to the new script. In a future version of the iOS agent the Python based symbol upload scripts will be removed.

* This artifact was built using Xcode 13.4.1 with a minimum deployment target of iOS version 9.0. Compatible with CocoaPods 1.10 or higher and Swift Package Manager.
* For Mac Catalyst, the zip file installation may integrate more easily than using CocoaPods.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.2.1 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/xcframework-agent-700) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-700)
