### Improvements

tvOS is now supported! The New Relic agent will now build and run on your tvOS apps with the same great features as the iOS agent! For more information, learn how to [install and configure the iOS agent for tvOS apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/tvos/new-relic-tvos-compatibility-requirements).

### Fixes

Fixed crash caused by a notification that could occur if the app is shutting down when it attempts to access deallocated objects.
