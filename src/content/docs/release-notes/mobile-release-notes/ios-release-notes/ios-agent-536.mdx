### Improvements

* Improved the dSYM archive uploader so it will now dispatch asynchronously to the build, and will retry the upload up to 3 times.
* Custom metrics will now accept spaces in the name.
* Improved Cocoapods support. The NewRelicAgent podspec no longer includes version strings in framework paths. This eases pod management and reduces diff clutter when dealing with version control software.

### Fixes

* ​Corrected a bug in crash reporting where certain internal symbols were globally visible when the -ObjC linker flag is present.
* Corrected a bug in crash reporting where Cortex-A9 chips were reported as ARM-Unknown in crash reports.
* Validating the length of activities, only allowing those with a start time within the current session.
