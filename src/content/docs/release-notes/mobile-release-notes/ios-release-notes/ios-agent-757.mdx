<Callout variant="important">
Starting from iOS SDK version 7.5.4, a change has been implemented that causes previously suppressed Handled Exception events to be reported.

Please update to New Relic iOS agent 7.5.8. We've identified a bug in iOS SDK version 7.5.7 that could cause a crash on agent launch, and a fix is included in the New Relic iOS agent 7.5.8 release.
</Callout>

## Fixed in this release

* Agent is built using Xcode 16.4.
* Fixed an issue that could cause distributed tracing to not have all required account information at start of a session.
