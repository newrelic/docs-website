* Fixed a bug when using `NRFeatureFlag_BackgroundReporting` that caused some events created in the background to not get reported.
* New Relic iOS agent now supports remote logging. Enable this feature within your mobile entity applications setting page to turn on logging for the agent. For more information on how to enable and configure remote logging visit our documentation.
