## Fixed in this release
* The tracked headers set in [addHTTPHeaderTrackingFor](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/add-tracked-headers) are now correctly added to network request events manually captured using [noticeNetworkRequestForURL](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/network-request-success).
* Fixed a bug in the new event system that prevented adding an attribute with a key that contain a reserved key string as a prefix.
* Made changes to address the `NRMA__deallocInteractionHistoryList` crash reported by users.

## Other notes
* The iOS agent now supports automatic log collection for remote logging. This feature is limited to `NSLog()`,  Swift `print()`, and other print-family functions. To enable it, use the `NRFeatureFlag_AutoCollectLogs` feature flag. For more information on how to enable and configure remote logging, visit our [documentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/configuration/ios-remote-logging).
* Changed the agent to agent to consistently send the sampled flag as '01' (true) in the W3C Traceparent header to maintain trace continuity with OpenTelemetry agents, which expect '00' (false) for dropped spans and '01' (true) for sampled spans.

## Support statement

* As of iOS agent version 7.4.1, the iOS agent will consolidate previously separate XCFramework and tvOS agents into a singular iOS agent.
* As of this release, the oldest supported version of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/xcframework-agent-736) is 7.3.6.
