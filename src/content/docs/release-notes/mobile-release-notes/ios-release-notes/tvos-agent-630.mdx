### Improvements

* Agent can now handle region specific application tokens.

### Fixes

* Fixed inconsistency in `deviceManufacturer` session attribute; it will always be set as "Apple, Inc".
* `memUsageMb` session attribute will now be stored as a numeric value rather than a string value.
* Fixed race-condition in gesture instrumentation that could cause a crash on app background.
* `RequestUrl` and `RequestPath` attributes on `MobileRequest` and `MobileRequestError` events will consistently be not URL-encoded.
* Crash reports will now be uploaded immediately after processing on subsequent launch.
* Fixed potential race-condition in `+[NewRelic stopCurrentInteraction:(NSString*)activityIdentifier];` that could result in dead-lock.

### Bugs

* Missing llvm bitcode (fixed in 6.3.1)
