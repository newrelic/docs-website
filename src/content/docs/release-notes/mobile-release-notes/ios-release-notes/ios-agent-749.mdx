## Fixed in this release

* Fixed events maximum buffer size not maintaining after backgrounding.
* Fixed issue when `/connect` has a missing harvest configuration.

## Other notes

* Added the ability to store harvests that previously would be lost if the application doesn't have internet connection. These harvest are then sent after an internet connection is established and the next harvest successfully uploads.
* Use the `+ (void) setMaxOfflineStorageSize:(unsigned int)megaBytes;` API to set the maximum amount of data that can be stored locally. [More info](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/set-max-offline-storage)
* The feature flag `NRFeatureFlag_OfflineStorage` was added to disable the above mentioned offline storage.

## Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.2.1 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/xcframework-agent-700) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-700).
