### New in this release

* MobileRequestError events now contain the response body returned in the network request response, if one exists. Response bodies will only be reported if the [http response body capture feature flag](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/api-guides/ios-agent-configuration-feature-flags#httpResponseBodyCapture) is enabled. HttpResponseBodyCapture is enabled by default. Response body data will be limited to the first 4096 bytes (the Insights attribute limit).
* MobileRequestError events now also contain any cross-application tracing (CAT) data returned in the response headers. See [Introduction to cross-application traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces) for more information.

### Fixed in this release

* Fixed a memory leak in NRMAReachability.
