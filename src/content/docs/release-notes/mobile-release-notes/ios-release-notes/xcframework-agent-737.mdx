### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.2.1 of the [XCFramework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/xcframework-agent-700) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-700)
