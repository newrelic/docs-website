### Notes

#### Improvements

* **Crash reporting**
  * This release introduces [crash reporting for mobile apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/ios-agent-crash-reporting). Crash reporting supports capture and reporting of unhandled Objective-C runtime exceptions as well as native crashes like segfaults and bus errors.
  * Crashes include **Interaction trails:** a history of automatically instrumented actions that occurred during the app session leading up to the crashing event. No breadcrumbs needed.
  * The SDK includes a `[NewRelic crashNow]` method to trigger a test crash quickly and easily.
  * When an app is built for release, the debugging symbols are sent to New Relic (via a dSYM file) to automatically provide human-readable crash reports in the UI.
* **Swift app compatibility**
  * This release can be safely included in Swift applications. While we do not yet support instrumentation of Swift code, the New Relic SDK is now capable of instrumenting the Objective-C code included in your Swift app.
* **More configuration options**
  * An expanded runtime configuration API now supports disabling of crash reporting and interaction tracing, as well as enabling [experimental Swift instrumentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/enabling-swift-interaction-traces) for dynamically invoked methods.
