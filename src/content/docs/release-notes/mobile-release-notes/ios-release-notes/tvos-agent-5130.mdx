### Features

* Added a new _MobileBeadcrumb_ event type that allows you to annotate the execution of your app, to help troubleshoot crashes and provide greater detail in Insights. Use this new event type using the conveneince method _+recordBreadcrumb:withAttributes:_
* Added an additional _+recordCustomEvent:name:withAttributes_ method that takes the event name as an optional parameter. This avoids the need to add a name attribute in the passed attribute set.
