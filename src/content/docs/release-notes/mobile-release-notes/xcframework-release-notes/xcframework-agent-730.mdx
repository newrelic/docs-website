## New in this release

### Adds Distributed Tracing support
The agent will now add Distributed Tracing headers to instrumented network requests. This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled through the `DistributedTracing` feature flag. 

Refer to [How New Relic distributed tracing works](docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#no-sampling) for more information on Distributed Tracing in mobile apps.

## Fixed in this release

* Support for Xcode running on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Other Notes

* This artifact was built using Xcode 12.3 with a minimum deployment target of iOS version 9.0

### Support Statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/xcframework-agent-700) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 6.5.0 for the [iOS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-650) and [tvOS](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/tvos-release-notes/tvos-agent-650) agents.
