## Fixed in this release

* Support for Xcode running Catalyst and tvOS Simulator on Apple silicon Macs.

### Other notes

* This artifact was built using Xcode 12.3 with a minimum deployment target of iOS version 9.0. Compatible with CocoaPods 1.10 or higher.
* For Mac Catalyst, the zip file installation may integrate more easily than using Cocoapods.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/xcframework-agent-700) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 7.0.0 of the [XCFramework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-700)
