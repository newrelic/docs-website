# New in this release

We have made some updates to our system to improve its functionality. These changes include:

* Fetch instrumentation for http request
* Adds configurable request header instrumentation to network events
  The agent will now produce network event attributes for select header values if the headers are detected on the request. The header names to instrument are passed into the agent when started.
* Upgrading the native iOS agent to version 7.4.8.
* Upgrading the native Android agent to version 7.2.0.

These updates are intended to improve overall performance and functionality of our system. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to enhance your experience.
