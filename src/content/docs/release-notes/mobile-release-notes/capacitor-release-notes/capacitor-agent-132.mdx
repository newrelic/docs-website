# New in this release

We have made some updates to our system to improve its functionality. These changes include:

* Adding support for non-text XMLHttpRequest response types for HTTP Instrumentation.
* Fixing an issue where data was not being sent to the correct endpoint in cases where the Agent Configuration was not set up properly.
* Upgrading the native iOS agent to version 7.4.7.
* Upgrading the native Android agent to version 7.1.0.

These updates are intended to improve overall performance and functionality of our system. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to enhance your experience.
