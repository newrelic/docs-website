## Improvements

* Updated the Native Android agent to version 7.7.0.
* Intelligent Session Replay: Introduced ERROR mode (15-30s buffered recording triggered by crashes) and FULL mode (continuous recording) for optimized data capture.
* Session Control APIs: Added NewRelic.recordReplay() and NewRelic.pauseReplay() to allow manual, programmatic control over replay recording states.
* Networking Bug Fix: Fixed an OkHttp3 issue where peekBody() caused indefinite blocking on streaming responses (SSE/chunked) with unknown content lengths.
