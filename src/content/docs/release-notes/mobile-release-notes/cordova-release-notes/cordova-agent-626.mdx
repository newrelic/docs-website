## New in this release

* Fixed a bug in the fetch instrumentation where customer options were inadvertently removed when no headers were specified. Now, options will be preserved even when headers are absent.
* Addressed an issue that resulted in app crashes when an invalid URL was encountered in the capacitor plugin. To mitigate this, we implemented a valid URL checker to ensure that `mobilerequest` events are created only with valid URLs.
