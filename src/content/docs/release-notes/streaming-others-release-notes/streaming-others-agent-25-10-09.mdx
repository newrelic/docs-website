## Updated

  * Added `contentBitrate` attribute to video events. This uses `segmentationBitrate` if available, and falls back to `streamBitrate` when necessary.
  * Added `adBitrate` attribute to ad events. The ad bitrate is now extracted using multiple methods and is standardized to bps (bits per second).
  * Added `timeSinceLastError` attribute to error events, reporting the time elapsed since the previous error event.
