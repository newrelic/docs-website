### Support for Fluent Bit 3.2.7

Users will now receive Fluent Bit version 3.2.7, which includes fixes for known vulnerabilities. For more details, refer https://fluentbit.io/announcements/.

### Security

Previous versions of Fluent Bit in the [3.1 and 3.2](https://fluentbit.io/announcements/) series are affected by two security vulnerabilities if customers use the [OpenTelemetry input plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/opentelemetry) or [Prometheus Remote Write input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/prometheus-remote-write). The identified vulnerabilities are: [CVE-2024-50608](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50608), [CVE-2024-50609](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50609).
