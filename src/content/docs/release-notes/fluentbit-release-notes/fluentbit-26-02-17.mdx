### Support for Fluent Bit 4.2.2

Users will now receive Fluent Bit version 4.2.2. For more details, refer to the [Fluent Bit announcements](https://fluentbit.io/announcements/).

This release includes [New Relic Fluent Bit Output Plugin 3.4.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases/tag/v3.4.0) with critical security updates and enhanced platform compatibility.

### Security

The newrelic-fluentbit-output:3.4.0 image is built upon the upstream Fluent Bit 4.2.2, which utilizes a Debian Trixie (debian:trixie-slim) base image. The vulnerabilities reported (specifically in OpenSSL and core system packages) are identified by scanners that inspect all archived image layers, including build-time dependencies and upstream OS layers. Currently, there is no direct code-level fix available, as remediation requires a patch chain from Debian → Fluent Bit → New Relic. Until upstream base images are patched, these CVEs may persist in static scans despite having no impact.

#### Detailed Exploitability Analysis

The following CVEs are **not exploitable** in Fluent Bit:

* **[CVE-2025-15467](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15467)** - Not exploitable in Fluent Bit because it requires parsing S/MIME-encrypted messages, whereas Fluent Bit only processes plain text or JSON logs and uses OpenSSL strictly for standard TLS connections.

* **[CVE-2026-0861](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0861)** - Not exploitable because it requires attacker control over memory alignment, which is managed by the operating system and cannot be influenced through log input.

* **[CVE-2025-69419](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69419)** - Not exploitable because Fluent Bit uses the safe code path `PKCS12_parse()` instead of the vulnerable `PKCS12_get_friendlyname()` function, as confirmed by the CVE advisory.

* **[CVE-2025-69421](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69421)** - Not exploitable for remote code execution. It only causes denial-of-service crashes, which automatically recover in containerized deployments. Additionally, Fluent Bit does not parse untrusted PKCS#12 files.

* **[CVE-2025-69420](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69420)** - Not exploitable because it requires timestamp verification functionality used for code signing and legal compliance. Fluent Bit only forwards logs to New Relic and does not call `TS_RESP_verify_response()`.

* **[CVE-2025-15281](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15281)** - Not exploitable because it requires the simultaneous use of both `WRDE_REUSE` and `WRDE_APPEND` flags, which Fluent Bit does not use. Debian also classifies this as a minor issue with an unlikely exploitation scenario.

* **[CVE-2026-0915](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0915)** - Not exploitable because it requires calling `getnetbyaddr(0)` with a DNS backend enabled (non-default configuration). Fluent Bit does not perform network number lookups. Debian classifies this as a minor issue with high attack complexity.

One CVE is **conditionally exploitable**:

* **[CVE-2025-13151](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13151)** - Conditionally exploitable if certificates are loaded from untrusted sources or in the event of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. However, this risk is low when using New Relic's default trusted certificates and could increase to medium if custom or untrusted certificates are used.

### Added

* Support for SLES 15.6 and 15.7
* New Relic Fluent Bit Output Plugin 3.4.0 integration

### Changed

* The Infrastructure agent recommends Fluent Bit 4.2.2 packages
* [Fluent Bit Output Plugin Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/newrelic-fluentbit-output) uses Fluent Bit 4.2.2 with output plugin 3.4.0
* aws-for-fluent-bit base image updated from 3.1.0 to 3.2.1

### Fixed

* GLIBC compatibility issues on RHEL8 and Amazon Linux 2 using Zig cross-compilation targeting GLIBC 2.17
