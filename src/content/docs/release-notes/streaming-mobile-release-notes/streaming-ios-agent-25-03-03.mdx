## New features and enhancements

- **New Event Types Introduced**

## Deprecations

- **MobileVideo**
  - The `MobileVideo` event type has been deprecated. Users should transition to using the newer event types that offer enhanced tracking capabilities and specificity.

  Please [refer to the data model documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/video-agent-ios/blob/v3.0.0/DATAMODEL.md) for more details.
Event Types
• VideoAction: Events triggered by general video interactions, such as starting, pausing, or seeking.
• VideoAdAction: Events related to ad playback, such as starting, completing, or skipping an ad.
• VideoErrorAction: Events triggered by errors encountered during video or ad playback.
• VideoCustomAction: Custom events defined to capture specific actions or interactions beyond default event types.

## Impact and actions required

- **Transition from MobileVideo**: Users currently tracking `MobileVideo` events should adapt their implementations to utilise the newly introduced event types. This change provides improved specificity and scope in tracking actions across video interactions.
- **Update Implementations**: Integrators should update their systems to leverage new attributes introduced with the release, which provide richer context and detail for event tracking.
- **Testing & Validation**: We recommend testing the implementation of new attributes and event types to ensure compatibility and correct data transmission.
