## New service levels details page

We've redesigned the service levels details page view to better help you with the root analysis of an SLO breach.

### What we have introduced:

**Activity stream** - The activity stream, streams recent events from alerts and deployments and provides a direct view into what has changed in your system so that you can fix outages quickly.

**Alerts** - Create alerts on error budget fast-burn rate.

**Analyse** - Easy access to the original SLI query to enable further analysis.

**Compare with** - Compare the SLI attainment across two different time frames.

**Related entity** - A link to the SLI related entity's mini-overview, which provides important metrics of that entity.

**Save as a dashboard** - Share the service level data by creating a new dashboard.

**Time picker** - Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, if you want to select a pre-set time range or use a custom one, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI.
