## Support for metric timeslice data

APM metrics are reported as [timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data).
You can now leverage timeslice data in your SLI queries.

Learn how you can configure SLIs and SLOs in [our docs](/docs/service-level-management/create-slm/#sli-timeslices).
