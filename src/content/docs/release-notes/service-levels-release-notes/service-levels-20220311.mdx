title: 'Renaming availability SLI as success'
subject: Service levels
releaseDate: '2022-03-11'

New Relic suggests some typical SLIs for APM services and browser applications. If you choose to create one of the suggested SLIs through the UI, New Relic will analyze the latest data available, and will calculate the baseline for your SLI and SLO parameters.

One of the typical SLIs checks the proportion of requests that are served without errors. When we launched the service levels beta release we decided to name this SLI _availability_; but this term has generated some confusion because it is often interpreted as a service being up and running and able to receive requests. This is why we're renaming the suggested SLI as _success_ from now on.

The existing SLIs created through New Relic suggested flows won't be renamed.
