New Relic service levels is now generally available to all full platform users.

We've redesigned the service levels views to better help you in your day-to-day:

* Use the operations view to see your compliance and error budget trends.
* Use the period over period view in your plannings and business reviews.

Now, you can also add tags to your service levels on the setup flow, so you can later filter and group them by owner, user journey, maturity level, or your own custom tags.
