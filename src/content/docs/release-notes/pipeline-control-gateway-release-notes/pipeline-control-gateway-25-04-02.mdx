### Support for Pipeline Control gateway 1.0.0

New Relic Pipeline Control is the data management component of New Relic Control that helps filter and discard low-value data prior to ingestion into the New Relic Platform. It consists of an agent called the Pipeline Control gateway that's deployed in your environment. You can create NRQL-based rules to discard unwanted data before it exits your environment.

To know more about Pipeline Control gateway, refer to [the Pipeline Control documentation](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/overview/).
