## Pipeline Control gateway release notes - v2.0.0

### Updated to OpenTelemetry Collector v0.139.0

This release is based on OpenTelemetry Collector v0.139.0, bringing the latest stability improvements and features from the upstream project. This upgrade enables new data processing capabilities not available in previous gateway versions.

### New processor capabilities

Added three new processors that give you control over your telemetry data before it leaves your infrastructure:
    - **Sampling processor**: Reduce data volume with probabilistic and conditional sampling rules
    - **Filter processor**: Drop entire records or specific attributes based on OTTL boolean conditions
    - **Transform processor**: Add, modify, or delete attributes using OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL)

These processors can be chained together to create sophisticated data processing pipelines for metrics, events, logs, and traces.

### Enhanced configuration options

  - **Redesigned UI**: New form-based interface for creating and managing processor rules without writing YAML
  - **Enhanced YAML configuration**: Support for OTTL-based processor configuration

### Improved documentation structure

  - Comprehensive guides for each processor type with OTTL examples and use cases
  - Clear distinction between gateway rules (in your infrastructure) and cloud rules (in New Relic's infrastructure)
  - Expanded troubleshooting resources for gateway installation, health monitoring, and data flow issues
  - Reorganized information architecture for easier navigation
