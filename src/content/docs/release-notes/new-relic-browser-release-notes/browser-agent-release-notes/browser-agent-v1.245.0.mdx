## v1.245.0

### Features

#### Allow boolean values in setCustomAttribute

Allow boolean values to be supplied to newrelic.setCustomAttribute() API calls.

#### Detect GraphQL operation names and types in AJAX calls

Detect GraphQL operation names and types in AJAX calls and decorate AJAX events with that information.

#### Removing worker build

Removing the worker build from the agent. The worker build was a never released custom build of the agent that could be imported into web and service workers. The agent will continue to support running in those contexts but customers will need to use the NPM package to create their own customized agent for those contexts.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
