## v1.262.0

### Features

#### logging bundle optimization

Improve the bundle size of the logging feature by moving non-critical pieces to the aggregation portion of the agent code.

### Bug fixes

#### Release backlog memory when features are blocked by RUM

Plug a memory leak in Session Trace and other features. When entitlement or enable flag from RUM request returns a 0 for a feature, the agent will now release the reference to the events buffer under that feature so it can be garbage collected.

#### address call to stopTimer on undefined scheduler

Fixed an issue where session trace stopping on one tab while the same site was opening in another tab could result in the second tab throwing an exception when attempting to call `stopTimer()` on an undefined harvest scheduler.

#### safeguard api calls

Adding a safeguard to prevent an exception from being thrown when browser agent APIs are called before the agent is fully initialized.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
