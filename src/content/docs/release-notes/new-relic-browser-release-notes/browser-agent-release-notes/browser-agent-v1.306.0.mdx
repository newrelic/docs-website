## v1.306.0

### Features

#### Control log API through separate RUM flag
Logs captured by the `newrelic.log` method will now be configurable through settings and controlled separately from wrapped logs. This allows one to be disabled without affecting the other, as in the case that only `newrelic.log` is desired and not auto instrumented `console`.

#### Ensure responseStart is valid before relying on onTTFB
Adds an extra validation step to ensure that responseStart of the nav timing entry is valid before relying on onTTFB to return valid data.  The web-vitals library depends on that value to operate correctly, and without a valid TTFB response, the agent will not send the RUM call.  This change ensures that fallback measures are taken when responseStart is invalid, to ensure a RUM call is sent more reliably, which helps compatibility with unsupported frameworks such as ElectronJS.


### Bug fixes

#### Remove linebreak syntax from webpack output
Removes the newline character in webpack output to avoid issues with copy-pasting our script as a string inside code.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
