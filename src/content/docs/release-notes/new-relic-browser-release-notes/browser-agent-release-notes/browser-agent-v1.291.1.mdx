## v1.291.1

### Bug fixes

#### Prevent ST from holding onto Event refs in memory when aborted
Releases the `Event` entries the agent hold onto in Trace after it has aborted. This addresses a known case of memory leak caused by continuing to add those references to a Set that is never cleared.

#### Clean BrowserPerformance entryName for resources
The `entryName` attribute of resource type `BrowserPerformance` events will now have a cleaner URL, removing the hash fragment from reported URLs.

#### Add safeguards for addToTrace
Events created with addToTrace API, which have an invalid UNIX timestamp, emit a warning and return without creating the event.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
