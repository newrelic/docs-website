### Bug fixes

#### Pass unload options to simultaneous harvests in session replay

Pass unload options to simultaneous harvests in [session replay](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/) to allow all calls to utilize `sendBeacon` when unloading.

#### Fix deferred session replay payloads

Force agent to send preloaded session replay payloads if present at load time.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
