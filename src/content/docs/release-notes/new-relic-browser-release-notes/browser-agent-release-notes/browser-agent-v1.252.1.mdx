## v1.252.1

### Bug fixes

#### Fix webpack imports in npm package

Fixing some import overrides in our NPM package build to prevent imports existing that include code reliant on webpack globals. This will resolve the error `Uncaught ReferenceError: __webpack_require__ is not defined` when using the NPM package in a project that does not use webpack.

#### Page load after session timeouts don't start new session

When a session expires or becomes inactive while the user does not have the page open and they re-open the page, that is now treated as a new session.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
