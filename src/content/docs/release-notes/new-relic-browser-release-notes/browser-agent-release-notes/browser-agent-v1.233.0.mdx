## v1.233.0

### Features

#### Capture metrics for usage of MooTools and certain polyfills
New supportability metrics have been added to capture MooTools library usage and presence of customer-defined polyfills for certain native JavaScript features, such as function binding and ES6 Array prototype methods.

#### Update agent internals in early preparation for new features
The agent code base now contains the non-functional foundations of session replay mechanics. Note that this code is dormant and disabled. It will not download or execute until the session replay feature and its downstream dependencies are in a finished state.

### Bug Fixes

#### Address "configurable" warnings arising from user-agent module
The unused userAgent property and corresponding module have been removed from the runtime object due to "configurable" warnings being thrown in cases attempting to overwrite the runtime configuration.

#### Refactor usage of Array.from to address MooTools conflict
To work around a conflict with some versions of the MooTools library that mutate the native Array.from method, the agent will now use alternative methods.

#### Ensure runtime is preserved for late-configuration cases
Fix an issue where the internal runtime state of the agent was not preserved when the agent configurations were supplied after the loader had finished initializing, which caused the session to be cleared.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
