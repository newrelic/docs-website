## v1.281.0

### Features

#### Capture Nearest UserAction Fields
The UserAction feature has been extended to capture "nearest" field values when the UserAction target does not include the desired fields. To facilitate this, a configuration was added allowing the user to control what fields are collected, specified as `init.user_actions.elementAttributes: []`.  When empty, no extra fields will be collected.  When supplied, the target will be checked for each property. This configuration defaults to `['id', 'className', 'tagName', 'type']`, which matches the fields captured before this change. 

For each elementAttribute defined, if the property is not found, the agent will search up the parent tree of the target element, until the property is found.  If found up the parent tree, a property called "nearest" + fieldName will be added to the event.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
