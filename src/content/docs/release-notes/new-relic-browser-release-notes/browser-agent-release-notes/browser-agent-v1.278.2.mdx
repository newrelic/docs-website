## v1.278.2

### Bug fixes

#### Allow the page view feature to have access to an event buffer
Fix an issue where if the page unloaded before the page view feature could "block" itself from future harvests, an undefined error could be thrown when the harvester tries to access each feature's event buffer. The page view feature now has access to the event buffer, to prevent that undefined check.  The event buffer will remain empty, since the page view feature does not carry state. This change rectifies an issue observed in 1.278.1.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
