## v1.267.0

### Features

#### Upgrade to web-vitals v4
Upgrade to web-vitals v4.  For more info, please see https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/blob/main/docs/upgrading-to-v4.md.

#### Improve notifications of stylesheet status for session replay
The agent reports internal metadata about the status of stylesheets on the page when collecting session replay information. This process was spotty and the logic has been improved to make the metadata more consistent.  The ability to turn off "inlining" the stylesheets has been removed, as that behavior is required for the UI to re-render the replay.

#### Add soft navigations to Browser-Agent loader
Add the Soft Navigations limited preview feature to the default `Browser Agent` loader accessible via NPM.

#### Update TimeKeeper Source of Truth
Update the Agent's TimeKeeper to evaluate a timestamp provided directly by the consumer instead of a generic Date header, which should provide more control stability and granularity to the time synchronization processes.


### Bug fixes

#### Improve reliability of customMasker
The customMasker method of the Session Replay feature has been fixed to be more reliable with DOM elements that do not fit web-standards, as to not throw errors when processing.  Initial Replay harvests will now be gated until a valid snapshot is taken.

#### Stringify now returns an empty string if failed to transform
An internal mechanism used to convert objects to strings would return undefined if an exception was thrown during the process. This could lead downstream users of that method to throw errors if they expected the output to be a string. The utility method now always returns a string.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
