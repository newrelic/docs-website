## v1.301.0

### Features

#### Switch to using NR fork of rrweb
Browser agent will now switch to using New Relic's forked version of rrweb for Session Replay instead of the original repository. This will allow browser team to custom tailor hotfixes for issues.


### Bug fixes

#### Preserve agent attributes for log payloads
Adjust browser log payloads, such that agent-reserved attributes will take precedence over user-provided values if they happen to share the same name.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
