## v1.254.1

### Bug fixes

#### Server Timing - Remove reliance on performance API

Removing reliance on the browser resources API for the calculation of New Relic server time. On site with many resource requests, there was a small chance that the RUM network call would be flushed from the resources API cache before we could capture it and calculate server time.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.254.1 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 113-123, Edge 113-122, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 114-124.
