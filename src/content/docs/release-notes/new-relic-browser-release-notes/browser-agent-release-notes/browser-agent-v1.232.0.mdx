## v1.232.0

### Features

#### Minor changes to SMs
Add internal metrics to track the duration of the average session, to improve estimation for future efforts.

#### Add query parameter supportability metrics
Adding supportability metrics to capture legacy network method usage, query parameter size statistics, and custom data size statistics.

#### Allow custom error grouping
The `setErrorHandler` method now supports applying custom fingerprints to exceptions. Events with the same fingerprint appear grouped together in the New Relic One errors inbox.

#### Add new stateful Session Manager
The agent will now manage the end-user session lifecycle statefully, across page views and tab changes.

## Support statement:

We recommend you to upgrade the agent regularly so you get the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
