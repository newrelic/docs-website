## v1.291.0

### Features

#### Create the measure API
Adds the measure API to the `newrelic` global object. This API allows generating new BrowserPerformance data even if auto-detection of marks and measures is not enabled.


### Bug fixes

#### Fix race between end of session and features aborting
Fix an issue where features would race with the session manager when a session ends. This required a check for session timings to match a given session and could create a state where a new session created from a pre-existing session would trigger a partial replay or no replay, and prevent the agent from sending trace data with a given replay.

#### Harvest first session trace payload immediately
For better consistency, implemented old behavior where the first ST payload is harvested immediately when the page loads.  This helps ensure cases where replays are harvested but traces are not happen less frequently.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
