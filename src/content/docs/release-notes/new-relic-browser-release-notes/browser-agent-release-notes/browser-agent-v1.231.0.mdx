## v1.231.0

### Omit CLS scores before web-vitals report them
Initial snapshots of CLS reported as 0s attached to timing metrics will be omitted, so as to "de-noise" the aggregate CLS dataset. This also temporarily addresses an edge case of long loading pages potentially sending a "final" CLS value of 0, inaccurately. The case of a final 0 CLS when a user only navigates away from the page has also been fixed.

### Fix accepted argument type for `all` and `race` methods of `Promise`
The wrapped Promise's static `all` and `race` methods now work with iterators per native implementation, rather than only arrays.

### Upgrade Navigation Timing API in `PageView` (RUM) call
The performance entry data sent for `PageView` now uses the Navigation Timing Level 2 API over the deprecated Level 1 API.

### Fix typo in top-level API causing exception
An an uncaught reference exception was occurring on pages with more than one initialized agent due to a typo in the name of a variable (`returnsVals`).

### Add null entry checks to certain web-vitals handlers
For LCP and FID, we will exclude the performance entry info when there are no entries given by web-vitals. This had thrown exceptions.

### Remove previously added console logging measurements
This reverses performance impacts and exceptions introduced in the prior release by serializing console API arguments.

### Rectify version reported by NPM agent implementations
Agents installed via the NPM method will report the correct semantic version in data harvests.

### Fix exception when importing NPM package source code
An error was occurring related to a missing environment variable when importing from the NPM package source directly (versus via the CJS/ESM packages).

## Support statement:
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
