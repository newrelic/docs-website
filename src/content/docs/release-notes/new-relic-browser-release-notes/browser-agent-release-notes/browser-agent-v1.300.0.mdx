## v1.300.0

### Features

#### Remove usage of the marks and measures feature flag
No longer gates the agent by an internal feature flag.  Measures will be enabled for all users by default unless turned off through the application settings.

#### Reduce hasReplay attribute false positive rate
Only set "hasReplay" attribute once a successful session replay harvest has been observed to help reduce false positives.


### Bug fixes

#### Update typings for interaction API to reflect waitForEnd
Fixes an issue where the typing file defining the `.interaction` API was not decorated correctly to account for the optional `waitForEnd` argument as [documented](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/interaction/#parameters).

#### Address issues with dynamic require and Rollup.js
Fixes an issue that led Rollup.js to spawn the error `Error: Could not dynamically require ...` when building pages that included the MicroAgent loader.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
