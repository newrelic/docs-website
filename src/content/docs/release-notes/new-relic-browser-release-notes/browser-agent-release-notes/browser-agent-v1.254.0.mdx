## v1.254.0

### Features

#### Standardize all feature behavior to wait for RUM response

Force features to wait for entitlement checks from the rum call before processing buffered data.

#### maintain a harvestCount for use later with harvestId

Add a counter which increments after every harvest. This will be used in a future effort to curate a unique harvest ID for API paging purposes.

#### Add rum-response metadata handler

The initial connect call can now supply browser app metadata. This adds a handler to store and use that metadata for future harvests.

#### Calculate New Relic time in the agent

Migrating the process of time-stamping harvested data to the agent. The agent uses the date and time reported by the ingest pipeline during the RUM call as well as browser network and timing stats to derive a server time offset that can be applied to harvested data as event occur. This improves the ability to visualize the harvested data on a timeline within the New Relic UI.

### Bug fixes

#### Remove webpack imports in npm package

Transitioning certain module imports so that the default import is for the npm version of the module instead of the cdn or webpack version. This should completely eliminate all references to webpack globals when using the npm package.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
