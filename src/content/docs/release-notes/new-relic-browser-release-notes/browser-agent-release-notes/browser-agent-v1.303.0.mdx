## v1.303.0

### Features

#### Allow consent API to be invoked without localStorage access
Allows the consent API to function without requiring localStorage access, by keeping common state in the agent that controls harvests.  Applications must invoke the API on every hard page load when localStorage access is blocked.

#### Allow nested registrations
To facilitate inherent parent-child relationships with the planned register API, allow registered entities to expose their own `.register()` API for children of that entity to register with.  Entities who register with the container agent will be related to the container.  Entities that register under another registered entity will be related to both the container as well as the parent entity.

#### Additional validation to prepare agent for MFE registrations
Adding validation rules in the agent to prevent bad values for MFE target `id` and `name` in support of MFE/v2 registrations.

#### Add measure support to register API
Adds support for the measure API in the register response object. This is in support of the future micro front end offering planned.

#### Add useConsentModel functionality
Adds use_consent_mode init property and functionality. Adds the consent() API call. The consent model, if enabled, disallows agent harvesting unless consent is given through the consent() API call.

#### Retry initial connect call
To help prevent data loss, the agent will now retry the original "RUM" call an extra time for retryable status codes.

#### Add custom event support to register API
Adds methods for capturing custom events to the register API, to be used later when MFE support is established.

#### SMs for browser connect response
Adds supportability metrics for failed responses on initializing the page_view_event aggregate.


### Bug fixes

#### Obfuscate custom attributes for logs added after PVE
Extends obfuscation to cover custom attributes on logging events added after the initial RUM/PageViewEvent harvest.

#### memoize promise context propagation to avoid safari hangs

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
