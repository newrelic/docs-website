## v1.310.1

### Bug fixes

#### Enhance LCP entry with fallback attribution values
In cases wherein LCP is reported with no attribution entry from web-vitals, the agent will now pass on other default provided attributes such as `timeToFirstByte` instead of ignoring them.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
