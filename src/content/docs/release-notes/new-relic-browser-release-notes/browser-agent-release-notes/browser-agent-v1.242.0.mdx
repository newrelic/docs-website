## v1.242.0

### Features

#### Add messaging about Session Replay abort behavior

Add messaging to signal why a replay aborted, which could happen for a number of reasons.

#### Applying new cache headers to assets

Released browser agent assets will now be delivered with a 1 year cache header. This will allow user's browsers to cache the async chunks the agent loads for much longer and eliminate performance recommendations found in synthetic performance tools like Lighthouse. This will be applied retroactively to all released versions of the agent.

### Bug Fixes

#### Drain event emitter even when feature fails to initialize

A failure to import and initialize a feature could block the agent from draining data out of the event emitter, which prevents the agent from making any successful calls.  This fix allows the event emitter to drain even when an individual feature fails to initialize.

#### Validation of SR configurations

Update the block selector, mask selector, and mask input setters to handle empty strings.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
