## v1.234.0

### Features

#### Migrate RUM network call from GET to POST
When making its initial network call (the RUM call), the agent will now use the POST method instead of the GET method and will not depend on JSON-P to trigger follow-on events. This change facilitates setting custom attributes in the request body, reducing the likelihood of long GET URLs.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
