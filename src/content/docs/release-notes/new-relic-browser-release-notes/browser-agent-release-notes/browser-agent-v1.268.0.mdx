## v1.268.0

### Features

#### Aggregate UserActions

Utilize sequential aggregation techniques when observing UserAction data to reduce ingest cost for customers.

#### Add UserAction to GenericEvents

Select user interactive events will be captured in this release. This is an extension of the GenericEvents feature meant to drive UI experience.

### Bug fixes

#### Always return a string for custom stringify method

An internal mechanism used to convert JS values to string was returning `undefined` for certain values, which may lead to errors for downstream callers when they are expecting a string. This is part 2 of a patch to ensure a string is returned.

#### Force generic events feature to clear buffer when unloading

Fixed an issue where the generic events buffer was not clearing when unloading. This affected a small portion of experiences where the agent was "unloading" due to the page losing focus, but not actually closing.  Subsequent harvests when the page was re-focused would have the potential for duplicated data.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
