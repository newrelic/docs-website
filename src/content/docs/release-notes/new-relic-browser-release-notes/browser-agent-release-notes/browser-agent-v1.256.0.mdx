## v1.256.0

### Features

#### Generate PTID in Agent

Generate PTID in agent instead of in RUM response.  This allows PageView events to be decorated with a page trace ID.

#### Allow unmasking elements with nr-unmask selectors

Add custom masking mechanism to allow unmasking elements with `nr-unmask` class selectors and `data-nr-unmask` data attribute selectors

#### Adjust Session Replay Error Tracking

Adjust when errors are decorated with session replay identifiers to more closely match actual recording data

### Bug fixes

#### stabilize timestamp corrections

Ensure Session Replay timestamps are only ever adjusted once and fix correction factor to alleviate timeOrigin inconsistencies

#### Resume Page Focus Now Checks Session State

Check session state when resuming focus to an actively instrumented page.  This ensures that stale sessions are caught before invoking other feature-level methods.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
