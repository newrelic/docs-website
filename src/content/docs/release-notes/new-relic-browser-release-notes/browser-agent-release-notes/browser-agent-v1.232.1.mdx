## v1.232.1

### Bug Fixes

#### Add X-NewRelic-ID header only if defined
The agent will now set the `X-NewRelic-ID` header on XHR requests only when a truthy `xpid` value is explicitly set in the loader configuration. Previously the header was added even if undefined.

#### Identify inline stack trace URLs more precisely
URLs in `JavaScriptError` stack traces were sometimes misidentified as inline scripts when they shared a partial URL with the page on which the agent was loaded. The agent will now identify same-page scripts more precisely.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
