## v1.247.0

### Features

#### Session Replay API

Add two new APIs for controlling session replay behaviors:

* `newrelic.recordReplay()`
* `newrelic.pauseReplay()`

#### Add relative timestamps to Session Replay payloads

Add relative timestamps to Session Replay payloads to allow for server-side clock skew adjustments and improve the API pagination experience.

#### Expose library versions used to capture session replay data

Expose library versions used to capture session replay data, which helps sync visualizations in the UI Replayer components across version migrations.

#### Add basic support for deferring the browser agent loader script

Add basic support for deferring the browser agent loader script, including exposing a DOM-level event for external use to indicate the agent is successfully running.

#### Enable SRI and nonce attributes for async chunks

Additional JavaScript resources loaded by the agent will now include a SHA512 integrity hash and will respect the presence of a nonce token on scripts loaded on the page. This gets the agent closer to being able to run within an environment with a more secure content security policy.

#### Add session durationMs to Session Replay payloads

Add current session's running duration to all outgoing session replay payloads for use with ingest estimations

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.247.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 109-119, Edge 109-118, Safari 15-16, and Firefox 109-119. For mobile devices, v1.247.0 was built and tested for Android Chrome 100-119 and iOS Safari 15.5-16.2.
