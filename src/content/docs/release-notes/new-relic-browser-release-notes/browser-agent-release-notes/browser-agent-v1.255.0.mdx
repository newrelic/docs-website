## v1.255.0

### Features

#### Adjust session replay timestamps to New Relic server time

Adjust all timestamps sent as session replay event nodes to represent New Relic server time for accuracy in querying against adjacent but separate events in the timeline such as errors, page views, and interactions.

#### Send CLS as timing node additionally

`cumulativeLayoutShift` can now be queried for (with that as its `timingName`) as its own `PageViewTiming` event in New Relic. The additional attribution are a part of these events, and the values are more reflective of true end-session CLS scores.

#### Update agent to use new relic server time

Update the agent to use New Relic server time as the timestamp for harvested page action and error data.

#### Switch web vitals library to attribution build

Report extra attributes for each vital using web vital library's attribution build.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
