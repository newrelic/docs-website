## v1.292.0

### Features

#### Update `BrowserInteraction` and `previousUrl` definition
Update `BrowserInteractions` to use `document.referrer` for previousUrl values on `initialPageLoad` interactions instead of mirroring `previousUrl` and `targetUrl`. This enables better functionality for user journeys and provides more insight on page linkages.

#### Add more inspection events
Adds new inspection events to the agent. These events include the drain event, window lifecycle events such as navigate, load, DOMContentLoaded, and the session event which emits on changes to the agent's session state.


### Bug fixes

#### Fix `finished` API `timeSinceLoad` value
Fixes an issue where the `finished` api was creating a `timeSinceLoad` value for `PageAction` data as the unix timestamp instead of a relative time value in seconds from the page origin.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.292.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 127-137, Edge 127-137, Safari 17-18, and Firefox 128-138.
