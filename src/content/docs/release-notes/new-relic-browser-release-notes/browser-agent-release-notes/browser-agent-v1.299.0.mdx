## v1.299.0

### Features

#### Add Flutter supportability metric
Introduces a supportability metric to track browser agent usage in Flutter web applications.

#### Add user frustration signals to `UserAction`
Provide better insight into potential user frustrations for specific user actions via dead click and error click detections.

#### Evaluate the accuracy of cross-feature attribution
To support internal improvement benchmarks, add supportability metrics that evaluate the accuracy of attributes that indicate the state of a separate event, such as `hasReplay` or `hasTrace`.


### Bug fixes

#### Fix `recordReplay` API inconsistencies
Fixes an issue where a late-called `recordReplay` API call would not successfully harvest data.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.299.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 130-140, Edge 130-140, Safari 17-19, and Firefox 132-142. For mobile devices, v1.299.0 was built and tested for Android OS 16 and iOS Safari 17-26.
