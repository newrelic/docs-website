## v1.299.0

### Features

#### Add Flutter supportability metric
Emit a supportability metric to gauge usage of browser agent on Flutter web apps.

#### Add user frustration signals to UserAction
Provide better insight into potential user frustrations for specific user actions via dead click and error click detections.

#### Evaluate the accuracy of cross-feature attribution
To support internal improvement benchmarks, add supportability metrics that evaluate the accuracy of attributes that indicate the state of a separate event, such as hasReplay or hasTrace.


### Bug fixes

#### Fix recordReplay API inconsistencies
Fixes an issue where a late-called recordReplay API call would not successfully harvest data.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
