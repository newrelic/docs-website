## v1.270.0

### Features

#### Remove supportsSendBeacon runtime property
Removes the supportsSendBeacon runtime property from our agent code. We no longer officially support browsers that cannot use the sendBeacon method, so there's no point in checking for it.

#### Add Firefox to LCP test matcher
Add Firefox versions 122 and above to LCP test matcher since versions 122 and above now support collection of LCP web vital timings.

#### Remove 'pageHide' from page end-of-lifecycle listener
Remove `pageHide` from page end-of-lifecycle listener since browser agent support for Safari 14.4 is deprecated

#### Move deregisterDrain method to feature-base
Moves the `deregisterDrain` method in order to standardize the implementation pattern to match the drain method.

#### Relocate aggregator from loader and improve agent internals
Styling and architectural changes that will reduce agent loader size by moving the Aggregator module to async chunk and removing the need for some configuration getters in the features. No behavioral change or significant performance impact from the agent is expected.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.270.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 119-129, Edge 119-129, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 121-131. For mobile devices, v1.270.0 was built and tested for Android OS 15 and iOS Safari 16-18.
