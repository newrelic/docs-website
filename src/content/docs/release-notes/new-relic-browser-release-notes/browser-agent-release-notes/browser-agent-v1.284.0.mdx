## v1.284.0

### Features

#### Remove FID, replace first interaction detection with INP
First Input Delay (FID) has been deprecated and replaced by Interaction To Next Paint (INP). PageViewTiming events for first interactions are preserved by detecting the first INP event and will no longer output value for the `firstInputDelay` attribute. For more info on PageViewTiming, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details/. For more info on INP and the FID deprecation, see https://web.dev/articles/inp.


### Bug fixes

#### Deduplicate Prefixes on Unhandled Promise Rejection Messages
Remove an issue that caused `Unhandled Promise Rejection:` prefixes on casted error messages to be duplicated if already supplied on rejection reason messages.

#### Upgrade rrweb to 18
Upgrade RRWeb dependency to version 18 to improve session replay performance.

#### bump web-vitals from 4.2.3 to 4.2.4
Bumps [web-vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) from 4.2.3 to 4.2.4 to fix memory leak in registering new event listeners on every keydown and click ([#554](https://redirect.github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/pull/554))

#### Guard against non-CSSStyleSheet when fixing sheets for replay
Nullish values in the global `styleSheets` API can break implementations with the weakMap object tracking their status, throwing an error similar to `TypeError: Invalid value used in weak set at WeakSet.add...`.  This fix checks that the value is acceptable before adding.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
