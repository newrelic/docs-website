## v1.284.1

### Bug fixes

#### Obtain FirstInteraction directly from performance API
To alleviate the potential performance impact of creating new performance observers to support legacy FirstInteraction timings, a change has been made to query the performance API directly for the presence of first-input data without the use of an observer at logical checkpoints.

#### Console error on some cross-origin requests without NR CAT header
XHR headers will be checked for the deprecated New Relic CAT header before calling `getResponseHeader`, which throws a console error if it does not exist for cross-origin requests.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
