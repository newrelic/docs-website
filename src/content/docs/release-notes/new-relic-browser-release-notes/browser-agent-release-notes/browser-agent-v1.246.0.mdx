## v1.246.0

### Features

#### Replace url parsing with URL class

Replacing internal url parsing logic with the browser built-in URL class.

#### Add network info to all page view timing events

Add client network information to all PageViewTiming events in New Relic. The attributes currently only exist on LCP and FI event types and will now be reported with all others such as load and pagehide events.

### Bug fixes

#### Add feature flag support for Browser Interactions

Implementing a feature flag that will disable the fix [315](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-browser-agent/pull/315). That fix was specifically around Angular, React, and Vue applications with routes containing network calls resulting in browser interactions missing those ajax calls. This feature flag should not be enabled unless specifically instructed to do so by support.

#### Add first harvest of session flags to RUM and Trace

Mark the first RUM call and Session Trace harvest of any given session so that it becomes queryable in New Relic.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.246.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 109-118, Edge 109-117, Safari 15-16, and Firefox 109-118.
