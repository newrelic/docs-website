## v1.269.0

### Features

#### Include logging feature in micro agent loader
Allow the MicroAgent loader on NPM to utilize the logging APIs to manually capture log data.

#### Add instrumentation metadata to logging
Add instrumentation attribution to logging payloads to fortify categorization and billing calculations in New Relic platforms. These attributes are dropped during processing and before storing the data and as such don't affect customer billing rates.


### Bug fixes

#### Only ever allow session traces to capture page load timings once
An edge case issue was resolved where session traces could include duplicate copies of the page load timings obtained from the browser timing APIs.

#### Handle Session Replay Security Policy Errors
Handle Security Policy Errors encountered by session replay when browser APIs have been natively disabled. This was also observed to happen in Chromium browsers that completely disabled cookie storage. Supportability metrics about agent internal errors are now captured as a biproduct of this work to help facilitate future improvements.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.269.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 118-128, Edge 119-129, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 119-129. For mobile devices, v1.269.0 was built and tested for Android OS 15 and iOS Safari 16-18.
