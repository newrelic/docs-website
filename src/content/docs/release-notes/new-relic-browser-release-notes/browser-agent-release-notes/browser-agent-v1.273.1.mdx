## v1.273.1

### Bug fixes

#### Multiple MicroAgent undefined session and limit available API
MicroAgent class now only shows the relevant API for use with NPM. The set is limited to methods that relate to features available with the MicroAgent. An issue with missing session when multiple MicroAgents are initialized is also fixed.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
