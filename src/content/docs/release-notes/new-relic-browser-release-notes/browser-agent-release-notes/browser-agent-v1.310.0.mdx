## v1.310.0

### Features

#### better MFE timing handling
Improve the detection of script assets reported by the browser which power the MicroFrontEndTiming event's timeToFetch and timeToBeRequested attributes. This change also includes new assetUrl and assetType attributes to better illustrate the assets used to populate the timing data.

#### Removing old SPA feature & related wrappings entirely
This concludes the complete removal of the old SPA feature that is replaced by Soft Navigations feature. Since agent version 1.307.0, the default "SPA" was already switched over, so no breaking changes from this version are expected.

#### Capture MFE timings as MicroFrontEndTiming Events
Captures the lifecycle timings of registered entities in preparation for future micro front end product


### Bug fixes

#### Update measure API types
Corrects an issue where the typings associated with the measure API did not accept PerformanceMark as a valid input for start or end values.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
