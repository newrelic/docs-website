## v1.274.0

### Features

#### Upgrade SessionReplay libraries to latest version
Upgrade underlying session replay libraries to latest version which addresses some known bugs. This change also removes the error swallower inside the session replay module and instead handles all session replay errors at the window level to allow for external libraries to observe known errors to induce fallback behaviors, such as those implemented in CSS-as-JS libraries.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
