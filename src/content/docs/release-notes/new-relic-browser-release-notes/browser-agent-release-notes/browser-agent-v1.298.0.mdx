## v1.298.0

### Features

#### Factor long tasks into soft nav base interaction span
`BrowserInteraction` under soft navigation ("SPA 2.0") will extend in duration beyond DOM modification time until the point wherein no long tasks have been observed for 5 seconds. `JavascriptError` and `AjaxRequest` are not yet associated with such interaction during this extended period beyond the end of the original heuristic.


### Bug fixes

#### Force LCP to report the original page URL
Allow LCP to report its pageUrl distinctly from the harvest URL.  An issue was observed where soft navigations occurring before the LCP harvest would report the current page URL instead of the original page URL tied to LCP.  This change allows LCP harvest nodes to report the original URL, regardless of the current page URL.  The change should apply both to the `pageUrl` and `targetGroupedUrl` attributes.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
