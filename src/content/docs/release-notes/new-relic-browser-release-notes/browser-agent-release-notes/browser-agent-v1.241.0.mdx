## v1.241.0

### Features

#### Add SR entrypoint to NPM ahead of LP

Add SR instrumentation entrypoint to NPM ahead of the upcoming Limited Preview window

#### Removing hash from chunk asset name

Removing the hash from the chunk asset file name. This will allow internal and external automation to predict the file name of each asset chunk as long as the loader type and version number is known.

### Bug Fixes

#### Final harvest does not happen when initial RUM call fails

Fixes the final harvest behavior in cases when the RUM request fails. The initial request is meant to act as a gateway for the agent to start reporting data, and its failure should result in the agent not sending anything. As of previous version, the metrics and page view timing features do not follow this rule, and that has been corrected.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
