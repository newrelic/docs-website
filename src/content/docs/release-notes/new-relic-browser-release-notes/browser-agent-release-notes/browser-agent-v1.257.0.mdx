## v1.257.0

### Features

#### Session Replay preload optimizations

Optimize early load error detection to mitigate certain race conditions when transitioning from error mode to full mode.

#### Decorate errors with hasReplay individually

Change the error aggregation method to consider errors with a hasReplay flag separately to ensure timestamps are always correct. Decorate each aggregation set with hasReplay directly instead of a request-level query param

### Bug fixes

#### Session replay preload without autoStart

In scenarios where SessionReplay was configured to not auto start and the user already has a replay recording from a previous page or after a page reload, calls to the `start('session_replay')` API made too soon after agent initialization would be ignored.

#### JSEerrors harvest hasReplay decoration

In scenarios where the SessionReplay feature was preloaded but a recording was never started, errors happening on the page would be improperly decorated with the `hasReplay` flag.

#### Agent class type declarations

Fixing incorrect type declarations for the constructor parameters of the Agent class.

#### Soft navigations memory leak on harvest

Address a couple scenarios of memory being not released by the soft navigation harvest cycle.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
