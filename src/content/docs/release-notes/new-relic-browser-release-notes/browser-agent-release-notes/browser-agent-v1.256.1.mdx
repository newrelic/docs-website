## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.256.1 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 114-123, Edge 114-123, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 115-124. For mobile devices, v1.251.1 was built and tested for Android Chrome 100-123 and iOS Safari 15.5-16.2.
