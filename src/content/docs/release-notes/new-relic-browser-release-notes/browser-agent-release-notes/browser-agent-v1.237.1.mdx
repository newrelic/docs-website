## v1.237.1

### Bug Fixes

#### SPA feature respects ajax deny_list for fetch
The SPA feature will now properly respect the Ajax deny list and block internal settings for fetch calls. In prior versions, the SPA feature only consulted the Ajax deny list for XMLHttpRequest calls.

#### prevent dollar symbol only variable names
Prevent the build process of the agent from creating minified variable names that only contain the dollar symbol. If such a variable is immediately followed by an ampersand, as could be the case in a minified logic block, it could be picked up by string replacement logic applied to outgoing HTML within their server.

#### Undefined deny list ignores block internal
In cases where the customer's configuration does not include the `init.ajax.deny_list` property, the agent would not properly account for the `init.ajax.block_internal` setting and would not block Ajax events for internal agent network calls.

#### Fix serialization issue with array data
Update the harvester to account for array payloads, which in niche cases could convert array payloads to indexed objects.
