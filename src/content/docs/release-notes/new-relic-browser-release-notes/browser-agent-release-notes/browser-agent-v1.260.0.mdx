## v1.260.0

### Features

#### Improve time stamping of page view events

Improved the time stamping of page view events for subsequent page loads when sessions are enabled. Subsequent page loads will use the calculated New Relic server time to make the timestamp more accurate.

### Bug fixes

#### Adjust session entity to not race between tabs

Allow individual tabs loading simultaneously to calculate New Relic server time.

#### Add internal error handler to session replay recorder

Fixed a bug where internal errors caused by the internal session replay recording library from being reported as customer errors. They now report as internal errors.
