## v1.240.0

### Features

#### Origin of agent webpack chunks now changeable

Allow the agent to operate through a proxy. The agent needs to be able to fetch its source code and send analytics to a different domain, and this solves the former. NPM is not affected.

#### Add session trace metadata params

Add first timestamp and node count information to session trace payloads for optimization in UI experiences.

#### Add SR to pro and spa builds (only runs for LP customers)

Add the SR feature to Pro and Pro+Spa builds of the agent. The session replay library shipping with this version of the browser agent is in _limited preview_ and is not turned on by default. To use the feature, users will need to be part of the limited preview customer group and configure their browser application settings in the UI.

#### Centralize web vitals timings

Centralize web vitals timings to be accessible from any part of the agent.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
