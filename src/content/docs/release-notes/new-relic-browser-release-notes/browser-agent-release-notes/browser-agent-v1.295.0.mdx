## v1.295.0

### Features

#### Add error cause detection
Detect and report the cause attribute on captured JavaScriptError events.  If the cause is an instance of an Error, the stack trace will be captured, otherwise the stringified contents of the cause will be reported. This will be queryable in JavaScriptError events under the attribute `cause`.


### Bug fixes

#### Add monkey-patching warnings
Added detection and warnings for when expected globals have been monkey-patched before the agent has been executed on the page.  This can cause unexpected behaviors and the intent is to inform customers of this behavior.

#### Calculate first and last timestamps from raw data
Ensure the agent manually calculates the first and last timestamps of a SessionReplay payload before harvesting to help improve consistency on the UI replayer.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
