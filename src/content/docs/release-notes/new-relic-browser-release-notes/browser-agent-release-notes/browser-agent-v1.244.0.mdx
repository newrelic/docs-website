## v1.244.0

### Features

#### Bump rrweb to 2.0.0.11 and make constant dynamic at build time

Bump rrweb dependency version to 2.0.0.11 and include in Session Replay payload metadata dynamically

#### Add Session Replay configurations to collect inline assets

Add Session Replay configurations to collect inline images, stylesheets, and fonts for private applications.

#### Ensure 15 second minimum error buffer when possible

Add a two-step sliding window to ensure 15-30 second buffer time for applicable error replays

### Bug fixes

#### Fix invalid timestamps

Ensure that Session Replay node injection does not cause desynchronized timestamps for blob payloads

#### Isolate browser interaction node

Improving context isolation for events the SPA feature tracks to allow for multiple agent bundles to live on the same page. This is only intended for internal New Relic usage at this time and should not affect customers.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
