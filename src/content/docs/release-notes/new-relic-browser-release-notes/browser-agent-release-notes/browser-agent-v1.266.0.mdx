## v1.266.0

### Features

#### Removing long task
Previously, an agent configuration turned on reporting of long tasks that took over 50ms. This functionality is being shelved effective this agent version. The configuration will no longer do anything.


### Bug fixes

#### Remove nullish coalescing inside getter
Removed a nullish coalescing assignment in a class getter -- which even though is claimed to be supported -- behaved badly in old versions of webkit browsers like Safari 15, some versions of Mobile Safari, and old chromium iOS browsers that use webkit.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
