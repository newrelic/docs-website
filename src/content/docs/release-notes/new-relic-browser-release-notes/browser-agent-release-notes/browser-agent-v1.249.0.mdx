## v1.249.0

### Features

#### Allow empty string for session replay masking value

Allow empty strings to be provided for session replay masking values, which helps the UI/API provide sane fallbacks for never-set values.

### Bug fixes

#### loader missing sub-resource integrity hashes

Sub-resource integrity hashes were not being properly generated and included in the loader for async chunks related to session replay. This would cause a warning to appear in the browser console, but would not block those chunks from loading. This would have only affected customers taking part in the session replay limited preview.

#### Fix API warning messages

Fix warning messages given by API calls made before the agent has initialized.

#### Traceids not random when using `webcrypto`

Fix non-random hexadecimal generation when using the webcrypto api, which in turn creates non-random traceIds, that always end in 00.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. We no longer support older releases when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases roll out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
