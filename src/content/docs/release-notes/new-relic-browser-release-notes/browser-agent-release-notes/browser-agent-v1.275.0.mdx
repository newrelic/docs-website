## v1.275.0

### Features

#### Allow logs API wrapper to update custom attributes
This supports the rollout of the auto-logging feature without disrupting customers that may currently be using `wrapLogger` to wrap the `console` object.

#### Enable the browser agent to run in extension background contexts
Use fetch to send harvest payloads when `XMLHttpRequest` is unavailable, such as in browser extension contexts.


### Bug fixes 

#### Harvest generic events when max size is reached
To avoid behavior that could lead to more network requests than necessary, generic events will now harvest early when the max payload size is reached. This represents an increase from 64Kb to 1Mb.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
