## v1.276.0

### Features

#### Allow feature flags to control experimental features
Use internal feature flags to control experimental features, reducing your effort and supporting APM-injected installations.

#### Capture Page Resource Assets
Add detection for page resource assets that captures data as a `BrowserPerformance` event. This feature is being shipped in an experimental state and is off by default. To opt in to using this feature, it can be turned on by setting the config value `init.performance.resources.enabled = true` in Copy/Paste or NPM installations.


### Bug fixes

#### Ignore reserved attribute names on `UserActions` tied to the window
Force the agent to not capture target-level attributes for window-level `UserActions`. You can set window-level variables that mimic HTML element attributes like type or tagName. This change prevents the potential capture of those attributes as part of blur or focus user actions tied to the window.

#### Fix syntax error in fallback when tracking xhr readyState
Fixed the syntax error that would cause xhr readystate fallback checks to always capture.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
