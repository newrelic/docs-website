## v1.290.0

### Features

#### Bundler tools exports
An optional Webpack splitChunks cacheGroup matcher is now available for users who build the agent via NPM. This matcher enables de-duplication and merging of the agent's lazy-loaded JavaScript into a single chunk. This single chunk loads post-page render, consistent with the behavior of our pre-built agent for APM and copy/paste implementations.

#### Set UserAction currentUrl before aggregation end
Set currentUrl on the first event of a user action instead of at the end of aggregation.

#### Improve lazy-loading optimization
Optimize our pattern to ensure that code-bundlers such as webpack can more effectively tree-shake the output to only include the relevant files needed to run the agent.  This specifically helps reduce the bundle size, reduce the amount of lazy files generated, and streamlines "custom" agent builds used with NPM.

#### API Code Splitting
Split the API method definitions per feature instead of a single file shared across all loader types.  This allows each loader to only instantiate the necessary APIs for the features included, and reduce overall bundle size for the "Lite" build as well as custom-built agents with NPM.  A shell will still exist for non-initialized APIs to prevent errors from throwing on APIs used without the needed features.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.290.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 125-135, Edge 125-135, Safari 17-17, and Firefox 127-137. For mobile devices, v1.290.0 was built and tested for Android OS 16 and iOS Safari 17-18.1.
