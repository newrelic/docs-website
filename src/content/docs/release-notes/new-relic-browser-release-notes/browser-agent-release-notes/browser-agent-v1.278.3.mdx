## v1.278.3

### Bug fixes

#### Change obfuscator to read dynamically from configuration
Fix an issue where obfuscation rules are not honored if added after the agent has initialized.  Some user cases require obfuscation rules to be dynamically added, this change will allow that behavior -- as long as the obfuscation rules are added to `newrelic.initializedAgents[index].init.obfuscate`

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
