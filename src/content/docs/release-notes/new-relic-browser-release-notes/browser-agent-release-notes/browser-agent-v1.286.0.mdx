## v1.286.0

### Features

#### Erase .api property on agent instance
The `.api` property of full and micro agents have been removed. The browser API methods are instead moved to the agent instance itself for ease of targeted access. This includes a minor fix of runtime `loaderType` for agents that are re-configured after load.

#### Reduce noise from `mousemove` events
There may be an edge case where a site performance can be impacted if the browser agent picked up `mousemove` events via `addEventListener`.

#### Handle duplicate agent APIs
Top-level interaction api calls are only responded to by the first exposed non-micro agent. This was changed to prevent issues for customers that run multiple agents together. The top-level interaction api should only be used to communicate with the main agent on the webpage. API calls on micro agents must instead be directly called on the respective micro agents.


### Bug fixes

#### Patch `newrelic` event detail
There is an edge case where if there is a listener on the `newrelic` event (as described in the install [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#browser_delay)) and any API call is invoked inside this listener, it will trigger an infinite loop.

#### Get string className for SVG elements
Change the `nearestClass` field for SVG elements to be a meaningful string name. The `className` of such elements is of type `SVGAnimatedString` and previously resulted in an empty object string.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
