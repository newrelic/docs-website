## v1.285.0

### Features

#### Decorate harvest requests with ht (hasTrace) param
Decorate with `ht` (hasTrace) query param for all harvest requests except for blobs and logs endpoints.  This helps support searching for browser data with associated tracing data.

#### Inspection events
Adds inspection events that detail when various agent-related events occur. These events can be listened to on the event listener 'newrelic' string type. Events include agent initialization, agent fully loaded, event buffered, event harvested, and api calls.


### Bug fixes

#### Session Replay text masking for whitespace
There is an edge case where whitespace was being masked, which interferes with the layout/styling in session replays.

#### Logging mode on session update
Fixes a typo in the session update handler for logging feature. The `loggingMode` which controls feature output will be correctly set after its session mode value is updated from another tab or window.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
