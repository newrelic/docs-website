## v1.236.0

### Features

#### Expose MicroLoader in the npm package
The npm package now exposes an entry-point called `MicroLoader`, which may be used to instantiate multiple agents on one page. This loader type, which is smaller than the Lite loader, captures a distinct `PageView` event per instance but does not auto-instrument the page. Instead, manual API calls may be used to capture `JavaScriptError` and `PageAction` events via the `noticeError` and `addPageAction` methods.

#### Remove img, jsonp, and xhrGet methods
Unused agent network methods have been removed. All data transmitted by the agent will now default to using `XMLHttpRequest` POST calls except for data transmitted during a visibility change or page unload. Visibility changes and page unloads will use `sendBeacon` with a fallback to fetch with keepalive. For browsers that do not support `sendBeacon`, the final data transmission will use `XMLHttpRequest` POST.

### Bug Fixes

#### Handle chunk load promise error introduced in 1.235.0
Starting in 1.235.0, loading the agent in browsers with strict privacy settings resulted in an uncaught error in a promise. This error has been handled, and chunk load failures again result only in a warning.

#### Fix illegal invocation error on final harvest
An issue from 1.234.0 has been addressed in which an illegal invocation error could occur during a final harvest as a result of calling `addPageAction` and passing `window.location` as an argument before a navigation.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
