## v1.288.0

### Features

#### Prevent storing session data past session expiry
There may be edge cases where some Session Replay/Session Trace data could be stored even though the agent session has expired.  Add instrumentation to detect such occurrences and skip storing these events for the time being.

#### Introduce isFirstOfSession attribute on InitialPageLoad events
To help support User Journeys, the `isFirstOfSession` custom attribute will be added to `BrowserInteraction` events of initial page load kind if the page is the first of a new session.


### Bug fixes

#### Reset `notified` when replay stops recording
Resolves an issue where JavaScriptError events would be missing the `hasReplay` attribute after session recording is resumed (for example, from user clicking on another tab/tab going idle and then coming back to it).

#### Solve race condition in logging abort
If the logging feature aborted before the agent had set up the event buffer, it could throw errors.  This was addressed by checking for the presence of the event buffer before running methods against it.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
