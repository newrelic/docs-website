## v1225

### Gracefully abort agent if not fully instantiated
When importing of agent code fails, as when content gets blocked, the agent will clean up memory, the global scope, and any wrapped or modified APIs as much as feasible.

### Refactor wrapping of Promise object
The agent's wrapping of the `Promise` object has been refactored to address conflicts with third party libraries and to add newer methods available on the native object. The new wrapping implementation is more conventional and less error-prone.

### Fix uncaught promise error introduced in v1223
In some cases of failure to import agent script chunk "629", an error was thrown rather than caught and logged as a warning. The uncaught promise error responsible for this unintended behavior has been fixed.

### Resolve Google indexing of agent relative paths
In previous versions, the agent script included relative paths to its lazy-loaded chunks, which Googlebot picked up and attempted to index as pages. This change removes those relatives paths from the loader and centralizes our lazy chunk loading of agent features.

## Support statement:
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
