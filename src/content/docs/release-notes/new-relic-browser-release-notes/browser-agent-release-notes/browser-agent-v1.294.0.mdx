## v1.294.0

### Features

#### Harvest early
The agent will now be able to trigger early harvests if certain criteria is met.  This will help ensure that more payloads are kept and memory leaks are prevented. The agent will initiate an early harvest when a feature buffer size reaches 16KB, otherwise it will continue to harvest every 30 seconds as before. This new behavior will apply to the following events:
* AjaxRequest
* BrowserInteraction
* BrowserPerformance
* Custom Events
* Log
* PageAction
* PageViewTiming
* SessionReplay
* UserAction

A separate effort will be conducted to enable early harvesting for timeslice metrics, javascript errors and session traces which use other mechanisms for storage in the agent.


### Bug fixes

#### report empty previousUrl as undefined
The `previousUrl` attribute on BrowserInteraction events was reported as an empty string is cases where document.referrer is empty.  This caused URL grouping to apply grouping on an empty string, leading to meaningless groups being appended to previousUrl.  `previousUrl` is now reported as `undefined` to allow URL grouping to skip empty URLs.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
