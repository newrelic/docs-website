## Improvements

### Doubled the limit of PageAction events per harvest

Up to 120 PageAction events can be harvested every 30 seconds.

### Removed call to /ping endpoint

Removed a legacy behavior used to ensure network connection was kept alive in IE 7/8/9.

## Bug Fixes

### Prevent duplicate session trace nodes

The final Session Trace node in a harvest, captured using the Resource Timing API, is no longer duplicated in the subsequent harvest.

This issue lead to 1 duplicate node in a Session Trace, every 10 seconds, over the duration of the trace.

### Memory overhead when agent script

Fixed a memory leak in the agent when the network request to load the second part of the agent is blocked.

### Update to file protocol restriction

Fixed an error thrown in the console when the agent is loaded using the `file://` protocol caused by features in the agent trying to run when others had been aborted.

### setTimeouts without callback functions

Fixed an issue where route change Browser Interactions would wait forever if a setTimeout was called without a callback function ([passing code in as a string in the first argument](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout#syntax)) as the first argument.

### Cypress.io

Fixed a conflict between the Browser agent and the Cypress.io test framework when instrumenting XMLHttpRequest.
