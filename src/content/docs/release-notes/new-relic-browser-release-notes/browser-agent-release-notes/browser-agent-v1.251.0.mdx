## v1.251.0

Add check for invalid stylesheet inlining and asynchronously fetch the stylesheet contents for future payloads.

### Bug fixes

#### Bubble Up API Methods to Top-Level Instance For NPM

#### Add fallback for currentBufferTarget

Add a fallback to the currentBufferTarget for cases where the preload buffer has been cleared

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
