## Improvements

### Retry harvest network requests

The agent retries harvest XHR requests when it receives 408, 429, 500 or 503 response codes. Additionally, includes a security update to address [NR21-01](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-01).

### File protocol disallowed

The agent will not report any data when it is on a page opened from a local file.
