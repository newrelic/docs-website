## v1.304.0

### Features

#### Warn message on session reset
Adds a warning code when an agent session reset happens so that we have better debugging on browser transition behavior.

#### Reduce Session Replay snapshot sizes
Use `slimDOMOption = 'all'` by default to reduce session replay snapshot payload sizes.


### Bug fixes

#### Observe document.body after document is interactive
Addresses the scenario where `MutationObserver.observe()` was issued before `document.body` is available, causing `Failed to execute 'observe' on 'MutationObserver': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.` error.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
