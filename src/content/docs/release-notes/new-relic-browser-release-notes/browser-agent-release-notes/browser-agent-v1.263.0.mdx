## v1.263.0

### Features

#### Optimize bundle size with warning codes
Decrease bundle size by converting static strings to warning codes with an accompanying link to a web resource.

#### Shut down agent if improperly configured
Shut down initialization of the agent if improperly configured. Agents must be provided a valid licenseKey and applicationID at runtime.


### Bug Fixes

#### Prevent agent using invalid date header
Shut down the agent when unable to read a correctly formatted date header for the page view event harvest. This prevents harvesting data with wildly inaccurate timestamps. This should only happen with third-party or non-agent code has tampered with the ajax response headers.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
