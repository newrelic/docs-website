## v1.238.0

### Features

#### Reducing the agent chunk count

Reducing the number JavaScript files the agent loads asynchronously down to a single file. This means customer's users will now only need to load one additional JavaScript file for the New Relic Browser Agent to operate. This additional JavaScript file will continue to only be loaded upon the document "load" event. This change not only reduces the number of additional requests the agent must make but also reduces the amount of code that must be loaded by eliminating duplication.

#### Add API: setApplicationVersion

Add api method to top-level interface to allow the setting of application version across all outgoing payloads

### Bug Fixes

#### Capture potential missing tail data for session trace

Send buffered session trace data in certain cases when it's being discarded at the tail end of a captured session.

#### Fix distributed tracing handling of empty string fetch parameter

Fixing an issue with distributed tracing that would result in an exception within the agent when fetch is called with an empty string as the first parameter.

#### Typo in type declarations

Fixing typos made in the browser and micro agent API declarations. This includes adding internal test cases for those types to ensure this issue does not happen again.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
