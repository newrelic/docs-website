## v1.243.0

### Features

#### Do not report ajax nodes in session traces if in deny list

Prevent ajax nodes derived from calls found in the ajax deny list from populating Session Trace payloads

#### Remove deprecated API inlineHit

Removing the browser agent API inlineHit. This API was deprecated in 2014 and is no longer supported or used by newer versions of the browser agent.

### Bug fixes

#### Re-update assets proxy to accept host URL strings

Previously, the agent expected the protocol (for example, `https://`) to be included in the configuration input. However, we have since decided to allow the protocol to be excluded, as the proxy beacon field only accepts a host string.

#### Adjust Session Replay meta and timestamps

Ensure that payloads can not ends with a meta node or start with a snapshot node for consistency in UI render queries.

#### Tap session entity into storage API for changes across tabs

Tap session entity into storage event listener for stateful changes across tabs.

#### Set Session Replay first chunk flags more reliably

Add logic to set `firstChunk` flag and replay mode on new replays more reliably.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
