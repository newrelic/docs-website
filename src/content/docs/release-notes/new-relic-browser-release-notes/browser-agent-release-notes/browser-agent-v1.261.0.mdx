## v1.261.0

### Features

#### Pass logging API args as object for better extensibility

Pass logging API arguments an object to allow for better extensibility later without requiring so many arguments for options.

#### Logging feature harvesting and optimizations

Allow the new logging feature to process and send harvests while optimizing log capture mechanisms

#### Create logging feature

Add basis of logging feature for handling and buffering observed log data

#### Add Logging Configurations

Add default configuration settings to be used for upcoming logging feature

#### Add wrapLogger API method for wrapping 3rd party loggers

Observe existing logging functions and report through event emitter for later processing when capturing log events.

#### Add Logging API entry points and central handler

Add Logging API interface and central handling mechanism as customer interface for capturing logging data

### Bug fixes

#### Reading finish of null in SPA

Patch cases wherein SPA `.end()` can throw exception on a finished or full interaction. `.end` still force finishes an interaction.

#### dedup pre-load ajax requests

Fixing an issue where ajax requests made prior to the page load event would be reported as part of the SPA data and as standard ajax events.

#### Prevent session reset triggers from harvesting session trace data

Prevent Session Traces from "final" harvesting if the session identifiers change during a page life-cycle, such as when a session becomes stale and resets.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date.
