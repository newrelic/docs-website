## v1.297.0

### Features

#### Prevent early harvests when in retry period
Prevent the agent from harvesting early when being rate limited.  If the ingest service returns a 429, the agent will replace its data and try the harvest again later.  While that is happening, it will no longer be able to harvest early as new data comes in, until it successfully harvests.

#### remove newrelic meta attribute
Remove the reporting of the __newrelic meta attribute from outgoing replay payloads.  This is being conducted as a measure to help save billable bytes for customers and reduce cost of use for Session Replay functionalities.


### Bug fixes

#### Fix exceptions for null bodies arising from empty harvests
A change has been made to enforce that all cleaned payloads ensure a valid output. Before, an empty string passing through the body cleaning process could throw an error as the mechanism would return the body as null.  Now empty strings will pass through untouched, allowing further processing to apply successfully.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
