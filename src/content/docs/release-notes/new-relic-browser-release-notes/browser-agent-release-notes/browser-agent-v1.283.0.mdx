## v1.283.0

### Features

#### Add global custom attributes to log data
Add custom attributes set by the `setCustomAttributes` method in Browser Agent API to logging data. These attributes are in the `common.attributes` section of the outgoing payload. Local custom attributes set by the `log` and `wrapLogger` APIs take precedence in the backend over the global custom attributes set by the `setCustomAttributes` API.

#### Add auto-logging feature
Introduces automatic observation of browser console methods to capture logging statements from the browser `console` across a given session automatically. On/off, logging level, and sampling are controllable via the application settings section of your browser entities. [Check the getting started guide for more info.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-features/browser-logs/get-started/)

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
