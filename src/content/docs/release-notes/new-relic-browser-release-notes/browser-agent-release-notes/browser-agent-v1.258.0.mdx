## v1.258.0

### Features

#### Restructure AJAX Aggregate

Re-organization of the Ajax feature as part of agent maintenance. This has no expected impact on its functionality.

#### Maintain calculated NR server time for session

This update changes the agent to store the New Relic server time calculated when session tracking is enabled. This will prevent the agent from re-calculating server time on subsequent page loads, ensuring the timeline view of events in New Relic is more accurate.

#### Add harvestId to Session Replay payloads

Adds a unique harvest ID to Session Replay payloads to support better indexing and querying on the platform.

#### JSErrors timestamped per harvest

JSErrors that happen multiple times throughout a page's life will now receive a timestamp unique to the agent harvest cycle instead of consistently reporting the timestamp of the first occurrence of that error.

### Bug fixes

#### Clean up xhrWrappable

Remove `xhrWrappable` which is an old variable checking for `addEventListener` on XHR. It is expected to have no compatibility impact on modern standard frameworks or browsers.

#### Prevent null CLS

Add a check to prevent null and undefined web-vitals values from being reported.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends upgrading the agent regularly to ensure you get the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.258.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 115-123, Edge 114-123, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 116-124.
