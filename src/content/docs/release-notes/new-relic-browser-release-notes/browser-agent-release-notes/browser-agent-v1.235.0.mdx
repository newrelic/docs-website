## v1.235.0

### Features

#### Add error mode to session trace
Session-enabled traces now have an "error mode" capability in which the feature lies dormant until an exception is thrown. Upon the error, the past 30 seconds of data is retained and sent, and the feature becomes fully activated again.

#### Minor feature class changes to support testing new features
Feature class internals and testing architecture have been augmented to support testing new experimental features in progress.

#### Decorate error objects to facilitate future UI experiences
Error payloads will now be decorated with a real timestamp and feature flags to facilitate error usages in future NR1 UI experiences.

#### Use new shared session for Session Trace feature
Session Trace becomes more aligned with the new interpretation of a user's session defined as part of the upcoming and experimental Session Replay feature. When the session tracking setting is enabled, the Session Trace feature will now use stored session info to make capturing decisions.

#### Remove unused data from session trace requests
Data defined by APM agents and the customer will no longer be included in session trace requests since the data is not consumed downstream and can result in 414 errors in cases where the custom data would cause the URL to exceed the maximum length of 8,192 bytes.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
