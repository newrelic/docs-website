## Improvements

### AjaxRequest events for all XHR/fetch requests
Previously, XHR/fetch requests were captured as `AjaxRequest` events only when they were part of a route change. With this change, all requests will be captured as events. This feature can be further configured by specifying which requests should not be collected.

### Span events are for all XHR/fetch requests
Previously, Span events were generated only for XHR/fetch requests that were part of a route change. With this change, all requests will be captured as Spans.

### Update to Cumulative Layout Shift calculation
The CLS calculation has been updated to use session windows in order to align with Google Chrome tooling (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, CrUX). For more information, see the [official blog post on web.dev](https://web.dev/cls-web-tooling/).

## Bug Fixes

### Prevent duplicate session trace nodes
The agent no longer calls the `clearResourceTimings` API, which had the potential to affect other scripts from accessing all resources. Instead, it now uses the `PerformanceObserver` API to collect information about resources.
