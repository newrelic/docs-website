## v1.309.0

### Features

#### Warn when more than one agent is running
Added a console warning when more than one Browser agent is running on the page.

#### Improve MFE tag setting
Enforce tags to be set for micro frontends by supplying an object of key-value pairs to the `tags` argument of the `register(...)` API.  This allows for tags to be specified with an explicit value instead of only supporting boolean tags.

#### Add WebDriver detection attribute to PageView & PageViewTiming
`PageView`, `PageViewTiming` and initialPageLoad-category `BrowserInteraction` events will now report a `webdriverDetected` property corresponding to the `navigator.webdriver` set by the browser.


### Bug fixes

#### Micro agent duplicate handlers
Fixes when micro agents are created in a staggered fashion, handlers for each agent is multiplied by the number of agents that follow.  For example if there were two agents, the handlers for the first agent was registered twice.  This had the effect of duplicating events + contents of harvest payloads.

#### allow child registrations from blocked parents
Allow blocked parent entities to still instantiate a child MFE when registering

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
