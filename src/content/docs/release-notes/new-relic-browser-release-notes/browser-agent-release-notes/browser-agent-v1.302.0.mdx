## v1.302.0

### Features

#### Prepare agent to utilize v2 harvests for MFE registrations
Update the agent to handle harvests for registered targets to use the newly defined v2 endpoint schemas. This will act as the mechanism to handle client-side entity and relationship synthesis as well as ingest MFE specific data. This will be supported for Log, PageAction and JavaScriptError events, but is currently gated behind internal feature flags until a public preview is announced.


### Bug fixes

#### User frustrations logic should be gated
Move user frustrations logic to browser scope only with FF gate in Generic Events instrumentation.  This should avoid running extraneous wrapping logic and events related to user frustrations.

#### Improve accuracy in standalone AjaxRequest event start times
Adjusts a problem in the agent where start times of certain standalone AjaxRequest event payloads were reported relative to the page origin instead of relative to the first event in the payload, causing discrepancies when visualizing in NR1.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
