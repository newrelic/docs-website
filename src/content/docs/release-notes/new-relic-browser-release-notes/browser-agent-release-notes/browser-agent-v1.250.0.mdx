## v1.250.0

### Features

#### Add a flag to note that a payload occurred during a replay

Added a flag to mark harvests as having occurred during an active session replay. This will aid cross-feature querying in NR1.

#### Session Replay Dynamic Loading

Allow Session Replay modules to load earlier in the page lifecycle if a replay is ongoing

### Bug fixes

#### TraceId generation regression (non-random trace ids)

Fixes a regression which caused all trace ids generated to end in a 0.

## Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.250.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 111-119, Edge 111-118, Safari 16-17, and Firefox 111-119.
