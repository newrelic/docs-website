## v1.253.0

### Features

#### Soft Navigations trial

Introducing a lighter and simplified version of the existing spa feature that tracks soft navigations. This new feature still sends `BrowserInteraction` events, but the duration and finishing of those interactions have been redefined. As a replacement, it ought to reduce complexity and integration issues around the existing spa and exhibit better and faster performance.

#### Apply deny list to ajax metrics

The ajax deny list has historically only applied to the collection of ajax events and not ajax metrics. With this feature, the deny list will also be applied to the collection and reporting of ajax timeslice metric data. If an ajax request matches an entry in the deny list, both events and metrics will be blocked from being collected in the agent. This feature will be behind a feature flag to assess impact before final complete rollout. Thanks to community member [@Wrhector](https://github.com/Wrhector) for contributing this feature.

#### Preload the session replay recorder when properly configured

Load the session replay recorder module before the page load when configured to do so.  This will increase visibility for recordable data for customers who have opted in to the behavior.

#### Isolate observation context per agent

Initial implementation of an isolated observation context per agent running on the same page. This reduces the modification of instances of globals like events and instead each agent will track its own observation context internally.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
