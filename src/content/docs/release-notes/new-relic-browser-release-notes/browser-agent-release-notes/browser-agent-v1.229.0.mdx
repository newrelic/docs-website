## v1.229.0

### Use semantic versioning scheme
The agent will now utilize semantic versioning for subsequent releases. The previous version (1228) will carry forward into 1.229.0, and so on.

### Use `web-vitals` library for internal timing calculations
In an effort to align and standardize the timings the agent collects, the agent now uses the [Google CWV](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals) library to track page timings such as CLS, LCP, FCP, TTFB and more. See [Core Web Vitals documentation](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) for more information.

### Ship the Browser Agent repository to NPM
The Browser Agent repository will now be available as a pre-release NPM package. See [@newrelic/browser-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/browser-agent) for more information.

## Support statement:
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New Browser Agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
