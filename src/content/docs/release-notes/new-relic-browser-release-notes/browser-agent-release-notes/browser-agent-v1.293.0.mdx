## v1.293.0

### Features

#### Add "long tasks" internal message
Add an internal message indicating if a wrapped function qualifies as a "long task".  This is to be used later in agent features to enhance future behaviors.

#### Emit SM on rum response invalid timestamps
Emit a supportability metric on receiving an invalid timestamp in the rum call response.


### Bug fixes

#### Address issue keeping distributed traces from being disabled
Addressed a bug where the agent was able to capture distributed traces, even when `distributed_tracing: false` was supplied in the configuration.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
