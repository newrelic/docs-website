## v1.279.1

### Bug fixes

#### CLS timing node not being reported post new Harvester
Reintroduce the `cumulativeLayoutShift` timing of `PageViewTiming` events into EoL harvests. After v1.278.0, this timing stopped being sent when the user leaves the page, resulting in a drop in CLS counts. The node contains attributes that aid in identifying the cause of bad scores.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.
