## v1.296.0

### Features

#### Harvest traces early
Update agent to handle session traces the same way other features handle data as of [1.294.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1.294.0/), by allowing harvests at 16kb of size.


### Bug fixes

#### Remove event buffer inspection event
Removes the event buffer inspection event to avoid a memory leak on using console.log with the `newrelic` window event listener.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-agent-eol-policy/). Release dates are reflective of the original publish date of the agent version.

New browser agent releases are rolled out to customers in small stages over a period of time. Because of this, the date the release becomes accessible to your account may not match the original publish date. Please see this [status dashboard](https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-browser-agent-release/) for more information.

Consistent with our [browser support policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types), v1.296.0 of the Browser agent was built for and tested against these browsers and version ranges: Chrome 129-139, Edge 129-139, Safari 17-19, and Firefox 131-141.
