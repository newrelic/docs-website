## Enhancements

### Improved error logging

Improved error logging by mapping Shaka errors to the following attributes: `errorCode`, `errorPlatformCode`, `errorMessage`, `errorStackTrace`, `errorSeverity`.

This enhancement ensures cleaner, more structured error data in New Relic by extracting only the essential error attributes from Shaka Player errors, removing unwanted properties like the `data` array.

## Updates

### Fixed CONTENT_ERROR Event

Attached the error `EventListener` to the player instead of its tag, following Shaka's specifications, to fix the `CONTENT_ERROR` event.
