This release of the New Relic Shaka Tracker includes a change to error reporting.

## Key changes

  * **Error reporting update**: The `errorName` attribute, previously used for identifying error description, has been deprecated. The `errorMessage` attribute is now the standard for conveying detailed error descriptions. Please update any monitoring or logging systems that rely on error information to utilize the `errorMessage` attribute going forward.

## Upgrade notes

  * Users who rely on the `errorName` attribute for error analysis should plan to migrate to the `errorMessage` attribute to ensure continued functionality and access to detailed error information.
