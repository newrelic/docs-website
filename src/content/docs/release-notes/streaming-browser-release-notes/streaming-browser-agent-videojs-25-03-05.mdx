## New features & enhancements

  - New event types introduced
    - **VideoAction**: This event type represents standard actions related to video playback and interaction.

    - **VideoAdAction**: Dedicated event type for tracking actions related to video advertisements, ensuring better granularity and reporting.
    - **VideoCustomAction**: A flexible event type for custom actions and interactions within video applications.

## Deprecations

  - `PageAction`
    - The `PageAction` event type has been deprecated. Users should transition to using the newer event types that offer enhanced tracking capabilities and specificity.

## New attributes introduced

  - We have introduced a set of new attributes to enhance data tracking and analytics. These attributes provide additional context and details for the new event types, Please refer to the [data model documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/video-videojs-js/blob/v3.0.0/DATAMODEL.md) for more details.

## Impact & actions required

  - **Transition from PageAction**: Users currently tracking `PageAction` events should adapt their implementations to utilize the newly introduced event types. This change provides improved specificity and scope in tracking actions across video interactions.

  - **Update implementations**: Integrators should update their systems to leverage new attributes introduced with the release, which provide richer context and detail for event tracking.

  - **Testing & validation**: We recommend testing the implementation of new attributes and event types to ensure compatibility and correct data transmission.
