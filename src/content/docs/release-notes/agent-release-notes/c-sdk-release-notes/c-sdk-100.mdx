### New Features

This is the first release of the New Relic C SDK! If your application does not use [other New Relic APM agent languages](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents-products#apm-compatibility), you can use the C SDK to take advantage of New Relic's monitoring capabilities and features to instrument a wide range of applications.

For more information, see:

* [Documentation](/docs/agents/c-sdk): How to get started with the C SDK, install and configure it, instrument transactions, segments, and errors, use the C SDK API, and do some basic troubleshooting.
* [GitHub](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/index.html): SDK files, data structure, field definitions and parameters, code examples, functions, variables.

### End of Life Notice

The previous APM Agent SDK is deprecated beta software. If you were previously using the Agent SDK, you can switch to the C SDK. Check the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/c-sdk-compatibility-requirements), and then [instrument, compile and link](/docs/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code) your application's code to use the C SDK. The C SDK currently does not support New Relic's HSM feature; this may impact how you schedule your transition away from the Agent SDK.
