## Notes

* Added support for Code Level Metrics on API methods: `startSegment`, `startBackgroundTransaction`, and `startWebTransaction`.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
