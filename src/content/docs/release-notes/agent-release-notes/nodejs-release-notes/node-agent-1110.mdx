### Improvements

* PostgreSQL support via the \`pg\` driver.

  The Node.js agent now records the amount of time spent in transactions with PostgreSQL databases. This timing can be viewed in the **Transactions** page within individual transactions and their traces.

  The agent supports all of the following \`pg\` usage scenarios:

  * Using the pure javascript API exposed directly from \`pg\`
  * Using the "native" API exposed from \`pg.native\`
  * Using the "native" API exposed directly from \`pg\` when the \`NODE_PG_FORCE_NATIVE\` environment variable is set
  * Using the pure javascript API from the \`pg.js\` module
