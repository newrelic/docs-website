### Notes

* Always cast ignored status codes to numbers so that people using environment-variable configuration or strings in config still get error status ignored properly.
* If you disabled server-side configuration, the server was still able to set the value of apdex_t for your app. This was an oversight, and has been corrected.
* Before, if you had request renaming rules, if the end result was the same as the match pattern (mapping `/path` to `/path`), they would be silently ignored. This has been fixed.
* MySQL instrumentation handles callback more consistently, so the transaction tracer doesn't get confused and stop tracking transactions with MySQL calls in them.
