## Notes

#### Features

* Added Interactive Application Security Testing(IAST) mode of security agent when `config.security.agent.enabled` is true. ([#1664](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1664)) ([3e926e5](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/3e926e59ab5feba4b2759d8a108c424b237b5eda))

**NOTE**: The security agent IAST mode is in public preview and should only be used in non-production environments.   

* To enable the security agent set `config.security.agent.enabled` and `config.security.enabled` to true. 


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
