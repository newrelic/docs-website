### Notes

* Add high-security compliance for accounts with enterprise security enabled. By default, the agent now works with high-security accounts, whereas previously agents would receive an `Access Violation`.
* Add a `.addCustomParameter(name, value)` api call for adding custom parameters to transaction traces, and extend the `.noticeError(error, customParameters)` for adding additional parameters to error traces.
* Documentation fix in the `README.md` for ignoring `socket.io` routes.
* Better support for disabling browser timing headers server side. Previously the agent would not pick up the server change until restart. The agent will now disable browser timing headers as soon as the next harvest cycle.
* Fix a `socket hangup error` that was causing some agents to fail to handshake with the New Relic servers.
