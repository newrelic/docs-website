## Notes

* Fixed bug where failure to retrieve CPU/Memory details for certain Linux distros could result in a crash.

  `parseProcCPUInfo` and `parseProcMeminfo` now check for `null` input prior to processing.

* Updated README to favor using `-r` to load the agent vs `require('newrelic')`.

* Updated `@newrelic/test-utilities` to 6.1.1 and applied a global sampling value of 10 for versioned tests.

* Migrated utilization unit tests from mocha to tap.

* Migrated logger unit tests from mocha to tap.

* Cleaned up or added future removal comments for several deprecation warnings.

* Added a script and corresponding CI job that will check for PRs that have been merged and not release and notify the team in a private slack channel.

* Updated the versioned test runner to always run against minor versions.

* Fixed a high severity npm audit failure.
