### Fixes

* Improved MongoDB find instrumentation.

  The `mongo` driver provides many ways to invoke its API and find documents. In previous releases, some API invocations would create transaction trace segments that would not end properly, leading to inaccurately large segment times. This release ensures the agent always instruments finding and iterating through documents, ensuring segment times are accurate.
