## Notes

* Added instrumentation for Prisma(`@prisma/client`).
   * Miniumum supported version of `@prisma/client` is 4.0.0.
   * Captures spans for queries. 
     * It names them based on the model and action.(i.e. Datastore/statement/Prisma/user/create)
     * For statements and queries using the `$queryRaw`, `$executeRaw`, `$queryRawUnsafe`, and `$executeRawUnsafe` the names will be aligned with the raw SQL.(i.e. Datastore/statement/Prisma/User/select)
   * Captures database metrics for all statements and queries.
   * Captures SQL Traces.
   * Provides connection between application and database server via service maps.

 * Updated `@grpc/protoloader` from 0.7.4 to 0.7.5.
 * Updated `@grpc/grpc-js` from 1.8.7 to 1.8.8.
