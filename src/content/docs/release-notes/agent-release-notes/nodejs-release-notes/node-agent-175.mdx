### Notes

* Plain `http` routes (i.e. routes outside of a framework) now apply config naming rules early. See [rules for naming and ignoring requests](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#rules-for-naming-and-ignoring-requests).

  This fixes a bug where generating the _Browser Timing Header_ would not work without a framework (i.e. express, restify, hapi).
* _Beta_ support for connecting to newrelic via ssl through a proxy.
