## Notes

* Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about about this feature, see the [APM logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context/). For additional configuration options, see the [Node.js logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-nodejs). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account, see our documentation to [disable automatic logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging) via the UI or API.

* Added a support statement to our release notes

* Added node 18 to CI workflows.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
