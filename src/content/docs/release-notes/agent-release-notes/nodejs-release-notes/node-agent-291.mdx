### Bug fixes

* Security bulletin [NR18-06](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-06):

  Fixes issue introduced in 2.8.0 where the agent may have captured all transaction attributes, even with High-security mode enabled on the account. This may have included sensitive data attached to transactions.
* Removed support for agent attributes include/exclude rules.

  These will be coming back in Node Agent v3.0.0. The fix for the above security bulletin required a backwards incompatible change to our attributes.
* Fixed bug in Bluebird instrumentation.

  Some methods were not instrumented correctly. This would cause a problem if a function was passed to these methods.

  Special thanks to Andreas Lind (@papandreou) for helping us find this bug.
