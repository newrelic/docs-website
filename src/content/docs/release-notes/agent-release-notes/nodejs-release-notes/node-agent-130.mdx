### Notes

* Support for Spumko's Hapi! This support works with both Hapi 1.x and 2.0.0, and like our Express and Restify instrumentation will automatically name transactions after Hapi paths (get it) and time how long it takes to render views.
* Before, transaction naming and ignoring rules didn't work with Express and Restify routes. This has been addressed and the documentation has been clarified. Much gratitude to everyone who helped us figure out how to get this right, and for dealing with the previous, unclear documentation.
* Parameters in the ignored params list weren't being ignored in all cases.
* A very annoyingly chatty log message had its priority level dropped several levels.
