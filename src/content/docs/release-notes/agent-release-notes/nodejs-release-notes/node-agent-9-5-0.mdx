## Notes

* Increased the default limit of custom events from 1,000 events per minute to 3,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable maximum limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, see [the docs for custom_insights_events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#custom_events_max_samples_stored). To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see [our Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/send-more-custom-events-with-the-latest-apm-agents/190497).

* Updated CI process to include collection of code coverage statistics.

* Added a [doc about our current feature flags)(https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/main/documentation/feature-flags.md).


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
