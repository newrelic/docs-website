## Notes

#### Security Improvements

* updated ESM loader to track instrumentation by url in a map instead of in url to avoid remote code execution. ([#1741](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1741)) ([c8dc779](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/c8dc779c7799b234290b6f7eb1d0a4e07d692ef9))


### Support statement:

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old.
