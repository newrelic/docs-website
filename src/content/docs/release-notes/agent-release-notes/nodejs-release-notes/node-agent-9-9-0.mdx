## Notes

* Added support for URL obfuscation using regex (Thanks for your contribution @matewilk)
  * For Distributed Tracing, this means that:
     * Incoming and outgoing requests' `path` will be obfuscated
     * Transaction's `request.url` attribute will be obfuscated
     * Span's `http.uri` path will be obfuscated
  * For transactions, this means that:
    * Transaction trace details `url` will be obfuscated
  * With the following example configuration, URL obfuscation will turn `/api/v1/users/12345456/edit` to `/api/v1/users/**/edit`.
    ```js
    url_obfuscation: {
      enabled: true,
      regex: {
        pattern: /(\/api\/v1\/users\/)([\d]+)(\/.*$)/,
        flags: "i",
        replacement: '$1**$3'
      }
    }
    ```
  * You can also use environment variables to configure URL obfuscation:
    ```yml
    NEW_RELIC_URL_OBFUSCATION_ENABLED: "true",
    NEW_RELIC_URL_OBFUSCATION_REGEX_PATTERN: '/(\/api\/v1\/users\/)([\d]+)(\/.*$)/',
    NEW_RELIC_URL_OBFUSCATION_REGEX_FLAGS: 'i',
    NEW_RELIC_URL_OBFUSCATION_REGEX_REPLACEMENT: '$1**$3'
    ```

* Add a new tracking type of instrumentation.  This will be responsible for logging `Supportability/Features/Instrumentation/OnResolved/<pkg>` and `Supportability/Features/Instrumentation/OnResolved/<pkg>/Version/<version>` metrics when packages are required.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
