## New Features

* Additional Transaction Information applied to Span Events
  * When Distributed Tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, the Agent will now incorporate additional information from the Transaction Event on to the currently available Span Event of the transaction.
    * The following items are affected:
      * `aws-lambda` related attributes
      * `error.message`
      * `error.class`
      * `error.expected`
      * `http.statusCode`
      * `http.statusText`
      * `message.*`
      * `parent.type`
      * `parent.app`
      * `parent.account`
      * `parent.transportType`
      * `parent.transportDuration`
      * Request Parameters `request.parameters.*`
      * `request.header.*`
      * `request.method`
      * `request.uri`
  * Custom Attributes
    * Custom transaction attributes added via `API.addCustomAttribute` or `API.addCustomAttributes` will now be propagated to the currently active span, if available.
  * **Security Recommendation:**
    * Review your Transaction Event attributes configuration. Any attribute include or exclude setting specific to Transaction Events should be applied to your Span Attributes configuration or global attributes configuration. Please see [Node.js agent attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/attributes/nodejs-agent-attributes#configure-attributes) for more on how to configure.

## Improvements

* Upgraded @grpc/grpc-js from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4
* Modified redis callback-less versioned test to use `commandQueueLength` as indicator redis command has completed and test can continue. This is in effort to further reduce these test flickers. Additionally, added wait for client 'ready' before moving on to tests.
* Updated force secret test runs to run on branch pushes to the main repository.
