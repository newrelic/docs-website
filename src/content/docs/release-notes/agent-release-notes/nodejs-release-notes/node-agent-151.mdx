End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Upgrade continuation-local-storage dependency to 3.0.0. The `newrelic` node module uses `cls` to help join asynchronous transaction segments. The latest `cls` module includes a fix that prevents contexts from leaking across transactions.
