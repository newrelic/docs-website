## Improvements

* Bumped @newrelic/aws-sdk to ^3.1.0.

## Fixes

* Fixed bug where the agent failed to reconnect to Infinite Tracing gRPC streams on Status OK at higher log levels.

  * Node streams require all data be consumed for the end/status events to fire. We were only reading data at lower log levels where we'd use/log the data. This resulted in a failure to reconnect and 'ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END' errors. The agent now always listens to the 'data' event, even if not logging, and will also reconnect (with 15 second delay) on any 'ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END' error.
* Removed initial harvest send() call on streaming span event aggregator to prevent warning in logs.

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
