## Notes

* Added instrumentation for `mysql2/promise`.
   * This previously only existed in our standalone `@newrelic/mysql`, but now gives feature partiy between the two.

* Removed unused native CPU metric sampler. This logic was no longer getting touched when running Node.js versions higher than 6.1.0.

* Fixed promise interceptor from re-throwing errors.

* Added transaction naming documentation ported from a [discussion forum post](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAX8W0000008ZfxWAE/relic-solution-the-philosophy-of-naming-your-node-agent-transactions).

* Added `promises.tap.js` to mysql2 versioned tests.

* Updated @newrelic/test-utilities to latest.
 * Removed unused test file in restify versioned tests.
  * Added `--strict` flag to versioned test runner to properly fail CI runs when test files are not included.
