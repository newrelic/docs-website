## New Features

* Bumped @newrelic/native-metrics to ^5.1.0.

  Upgraded nan to ^2.14.1 to resolve 'GetContents' deprecation warning with Node 14. This version of the native metrics module is tested against Node 14 and includes a pre-built binary download backup for Node 14.

## Improvements

* Added whitespace trimming of license key configuration values.

  Previously, when a license key was entered with leading or trailing whitespace, it would be used as-is and result in a validation failure. This most commonly occurred with environment variable based configuration.
* Moved to GitHub actions for CI.
* Updated PR template and added initial issue templates.
* Converted most of the collector API unit tests to use the tap API. Split larger test groupings into their own test files.
