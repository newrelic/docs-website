## Fixes

* Fixed named-pipe check for lambda invocations to avoid race-condition.

  Named-pipe existence will now be checked just prior to first write and then cached.

## Improvements

* Updated README with community-plus header.
* Updated README config copy example.
* Added Open Source Policy workflow.
* Removed repository CoC in favor of centralized CoC at org root.
