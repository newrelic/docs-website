## Notes

* Dropped support for `vision`, and instead only instrument `@hapi/vision`.

* Updated configuration system to automatically create an environment variable mapping for a new config value.
   * It will follow a convention of `NEW_RELIC_PATH_TO_CONFIG_KEY`.
   * For example if there is a new configuration option of `config.nested.object_path.enabled` the env var would be `NEW_RELIC_NESTED_OBJECT_PATH.ENABLED`.
   
* Removed `transaction_tracer.hide_internals` configuration. All of the internal configuration is now handled by Javascript symbols instead of non-enumerable properties, so there is no longer a performance penalty, as symbols are already hidden by default.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
