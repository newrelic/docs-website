## Fixes

* **Security fix:** Resolves an issue where transaction traces will still capture the request URI when the Node.js agent is configured to exclude the 'request.uri' attribute. This can be problematic for certain customers in environments where sensitive information is included in the URI. See security bulletin [NR20-02](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr20-02).

  The request URI will now be excluded from transaction traces if the 'request.uri' attribute has been set to be excluded at either the top-level 'attributes.exclude' configuration or at the 'transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude' configuration.
