## Notes

* Fix: Replaced `request.aborted` with `response.close` in HTTP instrumentation.
* Fixed issue where setting `NEW_RELIC_GRPC_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES` wasn't properly parsing the codes as integers, thus not ignoring reporting errors of certain status codes.
* Upgraded `@grpc/grpc-js` from 1.8.4 to 1.8.7.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
