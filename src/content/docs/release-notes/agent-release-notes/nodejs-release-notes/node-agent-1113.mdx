### Notes

* Updated hapi instrumentation to support the recently released v6.9.
* Fixed a bug where an invalid package.json could cause the agent to crash while it recursed through `node_modules` gathering version details.
* Properly name `other` SQL queries.

  Previously when the agent failed to parse SQL it would create a metric stating the database type, query type, and query table were all unknown. This has been changed to keep track of database type and create an appropriate `other` operation metric like other agents.
