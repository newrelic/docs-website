## Improvements

* Fixed a bug where spans queued up during backpressure situations would be improperly formatted and ultimately dropped when sent to an Infinite Tracing trace observer.
* Updated @grpc/grpc-js to version v1.2.0.
* Updated tap to clear up npm audit issues around lodash sub-dependency.
