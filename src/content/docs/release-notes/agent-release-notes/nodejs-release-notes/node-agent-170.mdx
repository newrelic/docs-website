### Notes

* Client side setting of `high_security` is now supported.

  High-security mode is a feature to prevent any sensitive data from being sent to New Relic. The local setting for the agent must match the server setting in the New Relic APM UI. If there is a mismatch, the agent will log a message and act as if it is disabled. A link to the docs for High-security mode can be found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/security#high-security)

  Attributes of high-security mode (when enabled):

  * requires ssl
  * does not allow capturing of parameters,
  * does not allow custom parameters

  The default setting for High-security mode is ‘false’.

  Note: If you currently have high-security mode enabled within the New Relic APM UI, you have to add `high_security: true` to your local newrelic.js.
* Fixed a bug in our instrumentation of restify, where if you were using the restify client with express as a web server, req.query would be overridden.
