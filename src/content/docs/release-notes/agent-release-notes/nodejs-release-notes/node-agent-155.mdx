### Notes

* Fix a bug where if the user disabled the error collector, error count would be carried over harvest cycles instead of reset. This would result in an ever increasing error count until the app was restarted.
* New Relic Insights beta support. This is a feature for our paying customers. The support of Insights in the agent is beta, this means we do not recommend turning the feature on in production, but instead trying it out in development and staging environments.

  To enable Insights support add the following to your `newrelic.js`:

  ```
  feature_flag : {
  insights: true
  }
  ```
