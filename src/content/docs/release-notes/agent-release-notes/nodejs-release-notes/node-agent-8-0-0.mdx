## Notes

* Added official parity support for Node 16.

* **BREAKING**: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information on our support policy,
  see: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent).
  * Upgraded `@newrelic/superagent` `@newrelic/aws-sdk` `@newrelic/koa` `@newrelic/native-metrics` and `@newrelic/test-utilities` to the latest major versions.
  * Refactored creation of span event aggregator to prevent crash of gRPC when running on invalid Node.js version.
  * Added check for minimum `node` version >= 12.
  * Set package.json engines `node` field >= 12 and `npm` field to >=6.
  * Removed Node v10 from ci workflow and smoke-test version matrix.
  * Removed comments around replacing `temporarilyOverrideTapUncaughtBehavior` test helper function.
  * Removed non-applicable semver checks for versions the agents no longer supports.

* **BREAKING**: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: `feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }`. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release.
  * Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false.

* **BREAKING**: Removed `serverless_mode` as a feature flag.

  The standard `serverless_mode` configuration still exists.

* Added hapi 19 and 20 to versioned tests for Node.js `>=12` and `<16`

* Added hapi `^20.1.2` to versioned tests for for Node.js `>=16`

* Upgraded tap to v15.

* Upgraded https-proxy-agent to v5.0.0.

* Updated linting to always use latest LTS Node version.

* Updated CI and Smoke Test scripts to use setup-node@v2.

* Added `no-const-assign` to eslint ruleset.

* Pinned mongodb versioned tests to &lt;4.0.0.
