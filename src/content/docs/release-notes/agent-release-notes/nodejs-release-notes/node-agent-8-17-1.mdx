## Notes

* Fixed issue where instrumented code invoked within a @grpc/grpc-js client callback would not get tracked by the agent.

   Bound the external client segment to the onReceiveStatus listener to propagate transaction context to the grpc client callbacks.

 * Fixed issue with truncate in `lib/util/application-logging.js`. It now checks that the argument is a string before checking its length.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
