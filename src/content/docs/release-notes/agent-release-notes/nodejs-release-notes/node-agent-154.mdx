### Notes

* On connect, the full `newrelic` module configuration is pushed to New Relic APM. Full config will be visible under the _Agent initialization_ tab, under the _Settings_ button in the APM application page.

  The reported settings will reflect the _running_ agent config, which may differ from the `newrelic.js` file depending on server-side, and environmental configuration.
