## Notes

* Added new configuration option, `grpc.ignore_status_codes`, which can be used to select nonzero gRPC status codes to ignore and not report as errors.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
