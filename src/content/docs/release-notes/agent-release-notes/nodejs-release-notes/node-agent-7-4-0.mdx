## Features

## Improvements

* Updated third party notices and manifest for husky and lint-staged.

* Pinned hapi 17 versioned tests to only minor/patch versions within 17.x.

* Bumped timeout for redis versioned tests.

* Wired up husky + lint staged to execute linting on all changed files in pre-commit hook.
