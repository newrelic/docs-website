## Notes

#### Bug fixes

* Updated initialization to return the API on start up to the security agent properly ([#1807](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1807)) ([99e5792](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/99e5792024263a61751b73976ed707ed51815388))

### Support statement:

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read more about keeping agents up to date.
