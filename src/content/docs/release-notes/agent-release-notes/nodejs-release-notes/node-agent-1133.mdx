### Notes

* Fixed a bug in Cross Application Tracing where the agent would sometimes attempt to set a header after headers had already been sent.
* Replaced the logger with one that is handles file writes properly lowering overall resource usage.

  This is a small change with a large impact. `fs.createWriteStream` returns whether data was queued or not. If it is queued it is recommended to wait on a `drain` event but this isn't mandatory. Most loggers we've found ignore this event which leads to many writes getting buffered and a rapid increase in native heap size as well as lowering the process's ability to respond to requests.
