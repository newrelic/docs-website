### Notes

* Captured parameters for express, restify, and hapi have been normalized.

  When `capture_params` is enabled the agent will collect route and query parameters. Previously express and restify only captured route params, and hapi only captured query params. This normalizes the behavior across the frameworks.
* Fixed an issue with restify instrumentation that caused the agent to always collect route parameters.

  Users of restify who want to continue capturing route (and now query) parameters are advised to enable `capture_params`.
* Fixed an issue where circular configs caused the agent to crash.
