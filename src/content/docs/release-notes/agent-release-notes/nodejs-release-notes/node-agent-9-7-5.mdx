## Notes

* Added a check to the code level metrics utility to ensure filePath was set before adding the `code.*` attributes.

* Updated to latest version of `@newrelic/test-utilities`.

* Fixed issue where listing of dependencies and packages from symlinked nested directories created an infinite loop which caused the agent to never connect.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
