## Notes

* Restored assigning loaded version of agent to require.cache as `__NR_cache` instead of a symbol to properly detect attempts at loading agent twice.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
