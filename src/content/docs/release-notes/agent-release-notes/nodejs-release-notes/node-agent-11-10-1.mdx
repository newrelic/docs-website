## Notes

#### Bug fixes

* Updated instrumentation registration to allow for instrumenting of a local file that does not exist within node_modules.
  * To properly instrument a local file, you must pass in `absolutePath` with the absolute path to the file that is being instrumented along with the `moduleName` which in this case is just the file name without the extension. ([#1974](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1974)) ([f545b4e](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/f545b4ebc3394f0a7179a51e156c6df28896edf0))

### Support statement:

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old.
