## Notes

* Added instrumentation to pino to support application logging use cases: forwarding, local decorating, and metrics.

* Added supportability metrics about the data usage bytes of harvested data to the collector endpoints.

* Added an optional way to avoid wrapping browser agent script with <script> tag when using `api.getBrowserTimingHeader`.  This will ease usage with Component based libraries like React.

  Thanks to @github-dd-nicolas for the contribution. 🎉

* Upgraded `@grpc/proto-loader` to fix a [CVE](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PROTOBUFJS-2441248) with `protobufjs`.

* Upgraded `@newrelic/test-utilities` to resolve a dev-only audit warning.
