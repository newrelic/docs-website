## Notes

- Added instrumentation to pino to support application logging use cases: forwarding, local decorating, and metrics.

- Added supportability metrics about the data usage bytes of harvested data to the collector endpoints.

- Added an optional way to avoid wrapping browser agent script with the `{'<script>'}` tag when using `api.getBrowserTimingHeader`. This will ease usage with component-based libraries like React. Thanks to [@github-dd-nicolas](https://github.com/github-dd-nicolas) for the contribution.

- Upgraded `@grpc/proto-loader` to fix a [CVE](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PROTOBUFJS-2441248) with `protobufjs`.

- Upgraded `@newrelic/test-utilities` to resolve a dev-only audit warning.
