## Improvements

* Moved all integration tests that required secrets to the smoke folder.

* Fixed LASP/CSP tests so they don't skip on runs where secrets are available.

* Modified self-signed SSL cert to use 'localhost' instead of 'ssl.lvh.me' for SSL testing.

* Removed unnecessary trace observer configuration validation for host and port.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed loading config from the main module's directory. Thank you @alexpls for the contribution.

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
