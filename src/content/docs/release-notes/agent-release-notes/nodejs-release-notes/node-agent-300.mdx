### Improvements

* Removed the `ssl` configuration option.

  TLS is now always used in communication with New Relic Servers. The `ssl` configuration value and `NEW_RELIC_USE_SSL` environment value are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than `true` will result in a warning.
* Security bulletin [NR18-05](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-06):

  Fixes issue introduced in 2.8.0 where the agent may have captured all transaction attributes, even with High-security mode enabled on the account. This may have included sensitive data attached to transactions.
* All request parameters now prefixed with `request.parameters.`.

  Previously request parameters such as route and query parameters were added as attributes without any name changes. For example `/foo?bar=value` would add the attribute `bar` to the transaction. Now this attribute would be named `request.parameters.bar`.

  Any Insights dashboards, alerts, or other NRQL queries using these attributes must be updated to use the new attribute names.
* Adds support for EU Datacenter
