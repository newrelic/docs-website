### Notes

* New Relic Insights support no longer requires a feature flag. If you are a paying customer, you'll begin to see data show up in Insights as soon as you upgrade to 1.6.0. The agent will send event data for every transaction up to 10,000 per minute. After that events are statistically sampled. Event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. You can read what is sent in more detail [here](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/basic-attributes#transaction-defaults).
