## Notes

* Added batching and compression to infinite tracing.
   * These options are on by default. 
   * To restore uncompressed spans set `config.infinite_tracing.compression` to `false`.
   * To send single spans vs batches set `config.infinite_tracing.batching` to `false`.
   * The environment variables for these new configurations are: `NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_BATCHING` and `NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_COMPRESSION`.

* Added support to record Nest.js error stack traces.
  * Nest.js is officially supported via underlying instrumentation of express or fastify.

* Added job to create a release notes PR in the post-release workflow.

* Removed request library and updated helper to use http/https to make requests in tests.

* Reduced cognitive complexity in lib/serverless/aws-lambda.js
