## Notes

#### Features

* Added supportability metrics to indicate how agent was loaded and if source maps were enabled ([#1657](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1657)) ([6f6f7e6](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/6f6f7e68bf382c6082550306aee30a670652347d))
    * `Supportability/Features/CJS/Preload` - recorded if `-r newrelic` was used to load agent  
    * `Supportability/Features/CJS/Require` - recorded if `require('newrelic')` was used to load agent  
    * `Supportability/Features/EnableSourceMaps` - recorded if `node --enable-source-maps` was present to start application

* Added logging of `process.execArgs` at the debug level ([#1654](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/pull/1654)) ([c85c006](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/commit/c85c006e722fce1271795b2613e1dd2a96983046))

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
