## Notes

* Added a new configuration option `heroku.use_dyno_names` to specify whether or not to use `process.env.DYNO` for naming the host name and display host.  This option defaults to true.  If you are on heroku and do not want this functionality set `heroku.use_dyno_names` to `false`.  You can also control this configuration options with the environment variable of `NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES`. Thanks @benney-au-le  for your contribution ðŸš€


### Support statement:

Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
