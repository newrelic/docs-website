### Notes

* Added support for synthetic monitoring transaction tracing.

  Synthetic monitoring lets you monitor your site from around the world. When you use synthetics to monitor your Node application, up to 20 detailed transaction traces will now be captured every minute when the application is probed from synthetics. To learn more about this feature, visit our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collecting-synthetic-transaction-traces).
