* Added a check for invalid characters in the `app_name` setting.

  The agent will now emit a warning and disable itself if any application name is invalid. Allowed characters are alphanumerics and certain punctuation characters (&#x7B;}.?!')
* Router queue time now properly handles floating point values.
* Fixed a bug where a socket connection could throw a synchronous error and cause the application to crash.
