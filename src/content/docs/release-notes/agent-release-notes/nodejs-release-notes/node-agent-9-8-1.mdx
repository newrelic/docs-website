## Notes

* Changed GCP metadata parsing to use `json-bigint` to avoid loss of precision from numerical instance ID.

* Instrumented `winston.loggers.add` so it works like `winston.createLogger`.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
