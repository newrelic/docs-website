## Notes

* Added ability to instrument ES Modules with the New Relic ESM Loader.
  * [Example ESM application](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples/tree/main/esm-app)

* Added support for custom ESM instrumentation.
  * There is structure to registering custom ESM instrumentation.  Set the relative path to the instrumentation entry point via `api.esm.custom_instrumentation_entrypoint`
  * [Sample custom ESM instrumentation entrypoint](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples/blob/main/esm-app/custom-instrumentation/index.js)
  * All the `newrelic.instrument*` methods will still work except `newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule`.  This is because it is geared toward CommonJS modules. 

* Added test for asserting ESM loader functionality on ESM-only package

* Added supportability metric of `Supportability/Nodejs/Collector/MaxPayloadSizeLimit/<endpoint>` when `max_payload_size_in_bytes` configuration value is exceeded.

* Removed `application_logging.forwarding.enabled` stanza from sample config as the feature is now enabled by default.


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
