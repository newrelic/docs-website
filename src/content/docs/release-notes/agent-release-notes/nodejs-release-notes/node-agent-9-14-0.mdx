## Notes

* Added new API function called `setErrorGroupCallback`, which provides a way for you to customize the `error.group.name` attribute of errors that are captured by the agent. This attribute controls how the Errors Inbox functionality groups similar errors together. To learn more about this function, please refer to our [example app](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples).


### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
