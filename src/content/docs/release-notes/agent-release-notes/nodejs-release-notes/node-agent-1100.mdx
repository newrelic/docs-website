### Notes

* Custom instrumentation

  The agent now allows you to annotate your application code to provide customized instrumentation. This includes the ability to time both web and background transactions, and add tracers to measure activity within transactions like querying a database. For more information, see [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/nodejs-custom-instrumentation)
