### Notes

* Browser monitoring! Real User Monitoring! Which is also known as RUM! Whatever it's called, it allows you to see how long your pages take to load, not just on the server side, but in the browser! Wow! It's super cool! We know a lot of you have been waiting for this, and it's here! It's manually set up with an API call! Check the README for details!
* By default, all communication between New Relic for Node and New Relic's servers is now protected with crisp, clean TLS encryption. To minimize the CPU overhead of running connections over SSL (and it can be configured, see the README and the online documentation for details on how to return to plain HTTP), New Relic for Node is now using a keep-alive connection that will properly pipeline connections, for both HTTP and HTTPS.
* Improved the timings for a large class of MongoDB / Mongoose use cases. If you've encountered the issue where MongoDB trace segments last for an absurdly long duration, this should help.
