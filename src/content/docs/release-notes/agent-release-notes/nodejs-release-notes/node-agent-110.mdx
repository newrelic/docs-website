### Notes:

* Added a new call to the API, `.noticeError`. See the [docs](https://npmjs.org/package/newrelic) for details, but unlike the other calls on the API, you can use this to pass off errors anywhere in your app, not just from within web requests.
* Ignoring slow (or polling) requests was only being applied to slow transaction traces. It now applies to metrics and transactions that end in errors.
* MongoDB, Redis and Memcached now honor the `capture_params` and `ignored_params` settings.
* New Relic for Node.js, like New Relic's other agents, has a sophisticated system for repeatedly trying to connect to New Relic's servers when the first attempt results in failure. This had been broken since (roughly) January. It works again now.
* The built-in debugging for the transaction tracer was out of date with respect to the production tracer. This is fixed, and you're welcome to satisfy your curiosity by enabling it, but it's really not going to be useful to you unless you feel like taking the time to understand what the tracer is doing at a low level. Do not ever enable it in production, as it degrades the tracer's performance and generates a huge pile of objects per transaction.
