### Notes

* Custom Instrumentation functions now pass through the return value of their passed in callback.
* Multiple improvements to PostgreSQL instrumentation

  When no callback was detected in the query functions, we were inserting our own. The insertion itself caused a crash. Adding a callback also modified the behavior of the pg module. Instead, we now listen for `error` or `end` events to finish segments.

  We now generate metrics for statement type/table combinations. Look for these in the database tab your APM Account!
