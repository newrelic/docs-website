<Callout variant="important">

For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Updated support for hapi 7.2 or higher.

  Hapi refactored how the server is instantiated and caused the agent to not be able to get transaction names. This release accounts for the update and enables full instrumentation.
