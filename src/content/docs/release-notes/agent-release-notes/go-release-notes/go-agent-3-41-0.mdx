<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from updating to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.41.0
### Added
  * Added `DistributedTracer.Sampler` config options for controlling the sampling behavior for Inbound Requests for distributed traces
    * To configure the sampler, added `ConfigRemoteParentSampled(flag RemoteParentSamplingConfig)` and `ConfigRemoteParentNotSampled(flag RemoteParentSamplingConfig)` which handles sampling behavior based on what the remote parent has flagged
    * Flags added are `"always_on", "always_off", and "default"` which can be called using `RemoteParentSamplingConfig`
    * `Example: newrelic.ConfigRemoteParentSampled(newrelic.AlwaysOff)`
  * Added OOM Monitoring Tests
  * Increased Secure Agent Test Coverage
### Fixed
  * Updated third-party library versions due to reported security or other supportability issues:
    * `github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2` from 2.52.7 to 2.52.9 in `nrfiber` integration
    * `golang.org/x/net` from 0.25.0 to 0.38.0 in `nrconnect` integration
### Support statement
We use the latest version of the Go language. At minimum, you should be using no version of Go older than what is supported by the Go team themselves.
See the [Go agent EOL Policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy/) for details about supported versions of the Go agent and third-party components.
