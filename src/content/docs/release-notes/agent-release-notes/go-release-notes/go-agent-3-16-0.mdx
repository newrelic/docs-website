## 3.16.0
### Added
* Distributed Tracing is now the default mode of operation. It may be disabled by user configuration if so desired. [PR #495](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/495)
   * To disable DT, add `newrelic.ConfigDistributedTracerEnabled(false)` to your application configuration.
   * To change the reservoir limit for how many span events are to be collected per harvest cycle from the default, add `newrelic.ConfigDistributedTracerReservoirLimit(`*newlimit*`)` to your application configuration.
   * The reservoir limit's default was increased from 1000 to 2000.
   * The maximum reservoir limit supported is 10,000.
* Note that Cross Application Tracing is now deprecated.
* Added support for gathering memory statistics via `PhysicalMemoryBytes` functions for OpenBSD.

### Fixed
* Corrected some example code to be cleaner.
* Updated version of nats-streaming-server. [PR #458](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/458)
* Correction to nrpkgerrors so that `nrpkgerrors.Wrap`  now checks if the error it is passed has attributes, and if it does, copies them into the New Relic error it creates.
This fixes [issue #409](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/409) via [PR #441](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/441).
   * This increments the `nrpkgerrors` version to v1.1.0.

### Support Statement
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that youâ€™re getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.
