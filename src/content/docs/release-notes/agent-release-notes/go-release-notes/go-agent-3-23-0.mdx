<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.23.0
