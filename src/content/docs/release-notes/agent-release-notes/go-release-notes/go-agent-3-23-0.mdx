<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.23.0

* Adds the `nrsecurityagent` integration for performing Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) of your application.

To learn how to use IAST, [check out our documentation](/docs/iast/introduction/).

### Support statement

See the [Go agent EOL Policy](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy/) for details about supported versions of the Go agent and third-party components.
