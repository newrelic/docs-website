## 3.10.0

### New Features

* To keep up with the latest security protocols implemented by Amazon Web Services, the agent now uses [AWS IMDSv2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) to find utilization data. [#249](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/249)

### Changes

* Updated the locations of our license files so that Go docs [https://pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) will display our agent. Thanks @tydavis for your PR to fix this! [#254](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/254)
* Added an Open Source repo linter GitHub action that runs on push. [#262](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/262)
* Updated the README.md file to correctly show the support resources from New Relic. [#255](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/255)
