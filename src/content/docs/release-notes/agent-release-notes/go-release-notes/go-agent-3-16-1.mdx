## 3.16.1
### Fixed
* Changed dependency on gRPC from v1.27.0 to v1.39.0. This in turn changes gRPC's dependency on `x/crypto` to v0.0.0-20200622213623-75b288015ac9, which fixes a security vulnerability in the `x/crypto` standard library module. Fixes [issue #451](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/451).
* Incremented version number of the `nrawssdk-v1` integration from v1.0.1 to v1.1.0 to resolve an incompatibility issue due to changes to underlying code. Fixes [issue #499](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/499)

### Support Statement
