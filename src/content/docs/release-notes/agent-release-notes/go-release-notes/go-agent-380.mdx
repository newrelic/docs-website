## 3.8.0

### Changes

* When marking a transaction as a web transaction using [Transaction.SetWebRequest](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic#Transaction.SetWebRequest), it is now possible to include a `Host` field in the [WebRequest](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic#WebRequest) struct, which defaults to the empty string.

### Bug Fixes

* The `Host` header is now being correctly captured and recorded in the `request.headers.host` attribute, as described [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-attributes#requestHeadersHost).
* Previously, the timestamps on Spans and Transactions were being written using different data types, which sometimes caused rounding errors that could cause spans to be offset incorrectly in the UI. This has been fixed.
