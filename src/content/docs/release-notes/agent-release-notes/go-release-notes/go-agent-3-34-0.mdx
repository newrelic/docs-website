<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.34.0

### Added

* `logcontext-v2/nrlogrus` can now collect user attributes
* `logcontext-v2/nrslog` can now collect user attributes
* Use `slog` to manage Go agent logs with the new `nrslog` library
* Use `zerolog` go manage Go agent logs with the new `nrzerolog` library
* Support for `RegisterTLSConfig` in `nrmysql`

### Fixed

* `logcontext-v2/nrlogrus` will still print user logs without issues if the Go agent has already been shut down
* Switched `protobuff` to `google.golang.org/protobuff` in `modfile`

### Support statement

We use the latest version of the Go language. At a minimum, you should use no version of Go older than what's supported by the Go team themselves.
See the [Go agent EOL Policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy/) for details about supported versions of the Go agent and third-party components.
