<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from updating to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.36.0
### Enhanced
  - Internal improvements to securityagent integration to better support trace handling and other support for security analysis of applications under test, now v1.3.4; affects the following other integrations:
    - nrecho, now v1.1.4
    - nrecho-v4, now v1.1.3
    - nrgin, now v1.3.3
    - nrgorilla, now v1.2.3
    - nrgraphqlgo, now v1.0.2
    - nrhttprouter, now v1.1.3

### Fixed
  - Added missing license files.
  - Fixed module dependencies in nrgrpc integration, now v1.4.5
  - Corrects handling of `panic(nil)` to no longer try to keep pre-Go-1.21 behavior but to allow newer language semantics for that condition. Fixes [issue 975](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/975).
