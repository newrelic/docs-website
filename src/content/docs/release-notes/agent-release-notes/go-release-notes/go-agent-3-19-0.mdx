## 3.19.0

 ### Added
 * `logcontext-v2/logWriter` plugin: a new logs in context plugin that supports the standard library logging package.
 * `logcontext-v2/zerologWriter` plugin: a new logs in context plugin for zerolog that will replace the old logcontext-v2/zerolog plugin. This plugin is more robust, and will be able to support a richer set of features than the previous plugin.
 * see the updated [logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go) for information about configuration and installation.

 ### Changed
 * the logcontext-v2/zerolog plugin will be deprecated once the 3.17.0 release EOLs.
