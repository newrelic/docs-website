## 3.15.2

### Added

* Strings logged via the Go agent's built-in logger will have strings of the form `license_key=`_hex-string_ changed to `license_key=[redacted]` before they are output, regardless of severity level, where _hex-string_ means a sequence of upper- or lower-case hexadecimal digits and dots ('.'). This incorporates [PR #415](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/pull/415).

### Support Statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that youâ€™re getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.
