## 3.18.0
### Added
* Code-level metrics are now available for instrumented transactions. This is off by default but once enabled via `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsEnabled(true)` transactions will include information about the location in the source code where `StartTransaction` was invoked.
   * Adds information about where in your source code transaction traces originated.
   * See the Go agent documentation for details on [configuring](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-code-level-metrics-config) code-level metrics and how to [instrument](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-code-level-metrics-instrument) your code using them.
* New V2 logs-in-context plugin is available for Logrus, packed with all the features you didn't know you wanted:
   * Automatic log forwarding
   * Log metrics
   * Capture logs anywhere in your code; both inside or outside of a transaction.
   * Use the Logrus formatting package of your choice
   * Local log decorating is now available for the new logcontext-v2/nrlogrus plugin only. This is off by default but can be enabled with `ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(true)`.

### Fixed
 * Fixed issue with custom event limits and number of distributed tracing spans to more accurately follow configured limits.

### Compatibility Notice
This release extends the API by allowing custom options to be added to calls to the `Application.StartTransaction` method and the `WrapHandle` and `WrapHandleFunc` functions. They are implemented as variadic functions such that the new option parameters are optional (i.e., zero or more options may be added to the end of the function calls) to be backward-compatible with pre-3.18.0 usage of those functions.
This prevents the changes from breaking existing code for typical usage of the agent. However, it does mean those functions' call signatures have changed:
 * `StartTransaction(string)` -> `StartTransaction(string, ...TraceOption)`
 * `WrapHandle(*Application, string, http.Handler)` -> `WrapHandle(*Application, string, http.Handler, ...TraceOption)`
 * `WrapHandleFunc(*Application, string, func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request))` -> `WrapHandleFunc(*Application, string, func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request), ...TraceOption)`

If, for example, you created your own custom interface type which includes the `StartTransaction` method or something that depends on these functions' exact call semantics, that code will need to be updated accordingly before using version 3.18.0 of the Go Agent.

### Support Statement
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that youâ€™re getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.
* Note that the oldest supported version of the Go agent is 2.11.0.
