## 3.20.0

**PLEASE READ** these changes, and verify your config settings to ensure your application behaves how you intend it to. This release changes some default behaviors in the go agent.

### Added
* The Module Dependency Metrics feature was added. This collects the list of modules imported into your application, to aid in management of your application dependencies, enabling easier vulnerability detection and response, etc.
   * This feature is enabled by default, but may be disabled by explicitly including `ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsEnable(false)` in your application, or setting the equivalent environment variable or `Config` field direclty.
   * Modules may be explicitly excluded from the report via the `ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsIgnoredPrefixes` option.
   * Excluded module names may be redacted via the `ConfigModuleDependencyMetricsRedactIgnoredPrefixes` option. This is enabled by default.
* Application Log Forwarding will now be **ENABLED** by default
   * Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This means that logging frameworks wrapped with one of the [logcontext-v2 integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-compatibility-requirements/) will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic with this version of the agent. To learn more about this feature, see the [APM logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context/). For additional configuration options, see the [Go logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account, see our documentation to [disable automatic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging) logging via the UI or API.
   * If you are using a logcontext-v2 extension, but don't want the agent to automatically forward logs, please configure `ConfigAppLogForwardingEnabled(false)` in your application.
   * Environment variables have been added for all application logging config options:
   	* `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_ENABLED`
	* `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_ENABLED`
	* `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED`
	* `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_METRICS_ENABLED`
	* `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_LOCAL_DECORATING_ENABLED`
* Custom Event Limit Increase
   * This version increases the **DEFAULT** limit of custom events from 10,000 events per minute to 30,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable **MAXIMUM** limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, set `ConfigCustomInsightsEventsMaxSamplesStored(limit)` to the limit you want in your application. To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see our Explorers Hub [post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/send-more-custom-events-with-the-latest-apm-agents/190497).
   * New config option `ConfigCustomInsightsEventsEnabled(false)` can be used to disable the collection of custom events in your application.

### Changed
* Changed the following names to be consistent with their usage and other related identifier names. The old names remain for backward compatibility, but new code should use the new names.
   * `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefix` -> `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefixes`
   * `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefix` -> `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefixes`
   * `NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_PATH_PREFIX` -> `NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_PATH_PREFIXES`
   * `NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_IGNORED_PREFIX` -> `NEW_RELIC_CODE_LEVEL_METRICS_IGNORED_PREFIXES`

* When excluding information reported from CodeLevelMetrics via the `IgnoredPrefixes` or `PathPrefixes` configuration fields (e.g., by specifying `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsIgnoredPrefixes` or `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsPathPrefixes`), the names of the ignored prefixes and the configured path prefixes may now be redacted from the agent configuration information sent to New Relic.
   * This redaction is enabled by default, but may be disabled by supplying a `false` value to `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsRedactPathPrefixes` or `ConfigCodeLevelMetricsRedactIgnoredPrefixes`, or by setting the corresponding `Config` fields or environment variables to `false`.

### Fixed
* [#583](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/583): fixed a bug in zerologWriter where comma separated fields in log message confused the JSON parser and could cause panics.

### Support Statement
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that youâ€™re getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach end-of-life.

We also recommend using the latest version of the Go language. At minimum, you should at least be using no version of Go older than what is supported by the Go team themselves.

See the [Go Agent EOL Policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy/) for details about supported versions of the Go Agent and third-party components.
