<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization's practices prevent you from updating, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

## 3.29.0

### Added

* Security agent integration `nrsecurityagent` now reports security configuraiton information along with the overall Go Agent configuration values. (Updates `nrsecurityagent` to v1.2.0.)
* Code-Level Metrics collection efficiency enhancement allows user callback function for as-needed (and just-in-time) evaluation of custom code locations rather than up-front location overrides, via the `WithCodeLocationCallback` CLM option. Deprecates `WithCodeLocation` option (although the latter function is still supported for compatibility with existing code).
* Added extended synthetics support for new `X-Newrelic-Synthetics-Info` HTTP headers.
* Documentation fixes.
* Removed deprecated `ROADMAP.md` file.

### Support statement

We use the latest version of the Go language. At minimum, you should be using no version of Go older than what's supported by the Go team themselves.
See the [Go agent EOL Policy](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy) for details about supported versions of the Go agent and third-party components.
