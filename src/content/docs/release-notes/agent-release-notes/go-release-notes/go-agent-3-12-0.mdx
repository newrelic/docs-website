## 3.12.0

### Changes

* Updated `CHANGELOG.md` release notes language, to correct typographical errors and clean up grammar. [#289](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/289)

### Fixed

* When using DAX to query a dynamodb table, the New Relic instrumentation panics with a `nil dereference` error. This was due to the way that the request is made internally such that there is no `HTTPRequest.Header` defined, but one was expected. This correction checks for the existence of that header and takes an appropriate course of action if one is not found. [#287](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/287) Thanks to @odannyc for reporting the issue and providing a pull request with a suggested fix.

### Support Statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
