<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as itâ€™s available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

### Added
* New integration `nrpgx5` v1.0.0 to instrument `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`. 

### Changed

* Changed the following `TraceOption` function to be consistent with their usage and other related identifier names. The old names remain for backward compatibility, but new code should use the new names. 
   * `WithIgnoredPrefix` -> `WithIgnoredPrefixes`
   * `WithPathPrefix` -> `WithPathPrefixes`
* Implemented better handling of Code Level Metrics reporting when the data (e.g., function names) are excessively long, so that those attributes are suppressed rather than being reported with truncated names. Specifically:
   * Attributes with values longer than 255 characters are dropped.
   * No CLM attributes at all will be attached to a trace if the `code.function` attribute is empty or is longer than 255 characters.
   * No CLM attributes at all will be attached to a trace if both `code.namespace` and `code.filepath` are longer than 255 characters.
