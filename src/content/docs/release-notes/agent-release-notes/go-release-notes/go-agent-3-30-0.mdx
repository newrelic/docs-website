<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it becomes available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from updating to the latest version, ensure that you regularly update your agents to a version that's at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).
