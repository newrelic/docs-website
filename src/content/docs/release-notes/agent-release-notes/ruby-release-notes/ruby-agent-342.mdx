### Fixes

* Support for Apdex T in server side configuration

  For those using server side configuration the Ruby Agent now supports setting the Apdex T value via the New Relic UI.
* The RUM NRAGENT tk value gets more robustly sanitized to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities

  The code that scrubs the token used in Real User Monitoring has been enhanced to be more robust.
* Refactoring of agent config code

  The code that reads the configuration information and configures the agent got substantially reorganized, consolidated, simplified, and made more robust.
