### Notes

* Exception list

  We've improved exception message handling for applications running in high-security mode. Enabling 'high_security' now removes exception messages entirely rather than simply obfuscating any SQL.

  By default this feature affects all exceptions, although you can configure an allow list of exceptions for messages you want to remain intact.

  More details: [https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-agent-configuration](https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-agent-configuration)
* Fix a race condition affecting some Rails applications at startup

  Some Rails applications using 'newrelic_rpm' were affected by a race condition at startup that manifested as an error when model classes with associations were first loaded. The cause of these errors has been addressed by moving the generation of the agent's 'EnvironmentReport' on startup from a background thread to the main thread.
