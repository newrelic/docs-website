### Notes

* Sidekiq supprt

  The Ruby agent now supports the Sidekiq background job framework. Traces from Sidekiq jobs will automatically show up in the Background tasks on New Relic similar to Resque and Delayed::Job tasks.
* Improved thread safety

  The primary metrics data structures in the Ruby agent are now thread safe. This should provide better reliability for the agent under JRuby and threaded scenarios such as Sidekiq or Puma.
* More robust environment report

  The agent's analysis of the local environment (e.g. OS, Processors, loaded gems) will now work in a wider variety of app environments, including Sinatra.
* Experimental Rainbows! support

  The Ruby agent now automatically detects and instruments the Rainbows! web server. This support is considered experimental at present, and has not been tested with all dispatch modes.

  Thanks to Joseph Chen for the contribution.
* Fix a potential file descriptor leak in Resque instrumentation

  A file descriptor leak that occurred when DontPerform exceptions were used to abort processing of a job has been fixed. This should allow the Resque instrumentation work correctly with the resque-lonely_job gem.
