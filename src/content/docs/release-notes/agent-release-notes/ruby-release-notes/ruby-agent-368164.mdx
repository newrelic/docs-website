### Notes

* X-Ray Sessions support

  X-Ray Sessions provide more targeted transaction trace samples and thread profiling for web transactions. For full details see our X-Ray sessions documentation at [https://newrelic.com/docs/site/xray-sessions](https://newrelic.com/docs/site/xray-sessions).
* CPU metrics re-enabled for JRuby >= 1.7.0

  To work around a JRuby bug, the Ruby agent stopped gathering CPU metrics on that platform. With the bug fixed, the agent can gather those metrics again. Thanks Bram de Vries for the contribution!
