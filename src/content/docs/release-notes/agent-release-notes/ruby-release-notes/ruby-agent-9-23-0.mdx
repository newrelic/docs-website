## v9.23.0

- **Feature: Add sidekiq.ignore_retry_errors configuration option**

  A new configuration option, `sidekiq.ignore_retry_errors`, has been added to control if Sidekiq job retries are captured. Retry errors are captured by default, but now if `sidekiq.ignore_retry_errors` is set to `true`, the agent will ignore exceptions raised during Sidekiq's retry attempts and will only report the error if the job permanently fails. Thank you [DonGiulio](https://github.com/DonGiulio) for recognizing this improvement and contributing a solution. [PR#3317](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3317)

- **Feature: Deprecation notice for recording deployments using Capistrano**

  Sending application deployment information using a Capistrano recipe is deprecated and will be removed in agent version 10.0.0. For recording deployments, please see our guide to [Change Tracking](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/) for a list of available options.

- **Feature: Use remote parent sampling configurations for decisions in more scenarios**

  Previously, the `distributed_tracing.sampler.remote_parent_sampled` and `distributed_tracing.sampler.remote_parent_not_sampled` configuration options were used for the sampling decision only when the `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers were present. Now, these configuration options are applied in cases when the `tracestate` header is missing and when only the `newrelic` header is available. This change makes distributed trace sampling more consistent and predictable. [PR#3306](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3306)
