### Notes

* Fix for Puma 2.8.0 cluster mode (3.7.3.204)

  Puma's 2.8.0 release renamed a hook New Relic used to support Puma's cluster mode. This resulted in missing data for users running Puma. Thanks Benjamin Kudria for the fix!
* Fix for deployment command bug (3.7.3.204)

  Problems with file loading order could result in `newrelic deployments` failing with an unrecognized command error. This has been fixed.
