### New Feature(s)

* Major refactor of data transmission mechanism. This enabled child processes to send data to parent processes, which then send the data to the New Relic service. This should only affect Resque users, dramatically improving their experience.

### Bug Fixes

* Resolve issue with configuring the Error Collector when using server-side configuration.

### Changes

* Moved Resque instrumentation from rpm_contrib to main agent. Resque users should discontinue use of rpm_contrib or upgrade to 2.1.11.
