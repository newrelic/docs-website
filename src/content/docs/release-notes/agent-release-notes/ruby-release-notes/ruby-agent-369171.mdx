### Notes

* Experimental Rubinius 2.x support

  The agent is now being tested against the latest version of Rubinius. While support is still considered experimental, you can track the progress at [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/rubinius](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/rubinius) for up to date status.
* Capture arguments for Resque and Sidekiq jobs

  The agent can optionally record arguments for your Resque and Sidekiq jobs on transaction traces and traced errors. This is disabled by default, but may be enabled by setting resque.capture_params or sidekiq.capture_params.

  Thanks to Juan Ignacio Pumarino, Ken Mayer, Paul Henry, and Eric Saxby for their help with this feature!
* Supported versions rake task and documentation

  We've improved our documentation for what Ruby and gem versions we support. Run `rake newrelic:supported_versions` or see the latest agent's versions at [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/supported-frameworks](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/supported-frameworks).
* ActiveRecord 4.0 explain plans for JRuby and Rubinius

  The agent's ActiveRecord 4.0 instrumentation could not gather SQL explain plans on JRuby by default because of a dependency on ObjectSpace, which isn't available by default. This has been fixed.
* Fix for Curb http_put_with_newrelic

  A bug in the agent caused PUT calls in the Curb gem to crash. This has been fixed. Thanks to Michael D'Auria and Kirk Diggler for the contributions!
* Fix for head position on RUM injection

  Certain unusual HTML documents resulted in browser monitoring injecting incorrect content. Thanks Alex McHale for the contribution!
* Specify the Content-Type header in developer mode

  Thanks Jared Ning for the contribution!
