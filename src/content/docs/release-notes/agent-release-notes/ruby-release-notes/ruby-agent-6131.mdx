## v6.13.1

* **Bugfix: obfuscating URLs to external services no longer modifying original URI**

  A recent change to the Ruby agent to obfuscate URIs sent to external services had the unintended side-effect of removing query parameters from the original URI. This is fixed to obfuscate while also preserving the original URI.

  Thanks to @VictorJimenezKwast for pinpointing and helpful unit test to demonstrate.
