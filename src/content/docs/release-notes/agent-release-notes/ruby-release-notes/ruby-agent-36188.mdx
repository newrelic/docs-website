### Notes

* Full URIs for HTTP requests are recorded in transaction traces

  When recording a transaction trace node for an outgoing HTTP call via Net::HTTP, the agent will now save the full URI (instead of just the hostname) for the request. Embedded credentials, the query string, and the fragment will be stripped from the URI before it is saved.
* Simplify Agent Autostart Logic

  Previously the agent would only start when it detected a supported "Dispatcher", meaning a known web server or background task framework. This was problematic for customers using webservers that the agent was not configured to detect (e.g. Puma). Now the agent will attempt to report any time it detects it is running in a monitored environment (e.g. production). There are two exceptions to this. The agent will not autostart in a rails console or irb session or when the process was invoked by a rake task (e.g. rake assets:precompile). The NEWRELIC_ENABLE environment variable can be set to true or false to force the agent to start or not start.
* Do not attempt to resolve collector hostname when proxy is in use

  When a proxy is configured, the agent will not attempt to lookup and cache the IP address of New Relic server to which it is sending data, since DNS may not be available in some environments. Thanks to Bill Kirtley for the contribution
* Added NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name

  Ordinarily the name of your transaction is defined up-front, but if you'd like to change the name of a transaction while it is still running you can use **NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name()**. Similarly, if you need to know the name of the currently running transaction, you can use **NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name()**.
