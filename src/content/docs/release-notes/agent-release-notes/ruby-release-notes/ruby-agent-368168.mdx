### Notes

* Percentiles and Histograms

  The Ruby Agent now captures data that provides percentile and histogram views in the New Relic UI.
* Missing Resque transaction traces

  A bug in 3.6.8.164 prevented transaction traces in Resque jobs from being communicated back to New Relic. 3.6.8.168 fixes this.
* Retry on initial connect.

  Failure to contact New Relic on agent start-up would not properly retry. This has been fixed.
* Fix potential memory leak on failure to send to New Relic.

  3.6.8.164 introduced a potential memory leak when transmission of some kinds of data to New Relic servers failed. 3.6.8.168 fixes this.
