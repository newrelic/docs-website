  ## v8.15.0

Version 8.15.0 of the agent confirms compatibility with Ruby 3.2.0, adds instrumentation for concurrent-ruby, and confirms Sinatra 3 compatibility with Padrino 0.15.2. It also enables batching and compression for Infinite Tracing.

- **Add Support for Ruby 3.2.0**

  Following the 3.2.0 release of Ruby, the New Relic Ruby agent has confirmed compatibility with and now supports the official release of Ruby 3.2.0. [PR#1715](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1715)

- **Add instrumentation for concurrent-ruby**

  The agent now instruments the [concurrent-ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) gem for versions 1.1.5 and above. This instrumentation provides visibility inside blocks passed to many of the gem's API methods, including `Concurrent::Promises.future` and `Concurrent::Future.execute`.


  | Configuration name                | Default | Behavior                                                                                                                      |
  | --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `instrumentation.concurrent_ruby` | auto    | Controls auto-instrumentation of the concurrent-ruby library at start up. May be one of `auto`, `prepend`, `chain`, `disabled`. |


- **Infinite Tracing: Use batching and compression**

  For [Infinite Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing/), which Ruby applications can leverage with the `newrelic-infinite_tracing` gem, payloads will now be batched and compressed to signficantly decrease the amount of outbound network traffic. [PR#1723](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1723)


  | Configuration name                | Default | Behavior                                                                                                                      |
  | --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `infinite_tracing.batching` | true   | If true (the default), the Trace Observer will receive data in batches instead of sending each span individually |
  | `infinite_tracing.compression_level` | high    | Configure the compression level for data sent to the trace observer. May be one of [none|low|medium|high]. 'high' is the default. Set the level to 'none' to disable compression. |


- **Add Support for Padrino 0.15.2 and Sinatra 3**

  We've added testing to confirm Padrino 0.15.2 and Sinatra 3 are compatible with the Ruby agent. Thank you [@nesquena](https://github.com/nesquena) for letting us know 0.15.2 was ready! [PR#1712](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1712)
