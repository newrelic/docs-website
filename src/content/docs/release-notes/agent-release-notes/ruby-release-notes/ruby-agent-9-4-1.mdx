## v9.4.1

Version 9.4.1 of the agent resolves a `NoMethodError` introduced in 9.4.0.

- **Bugfix: Resolve NoMethodError**

  Ruby agent 9.4.0 introduced [Roda instrumentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2144), which caused a `NoMethodError` to be raised when attempting to name a Roda transaction. This has been fixed. Thanks to [@spickermann](https://github.com/spickermann) for reporting this issue. [PR#2167](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2167)
