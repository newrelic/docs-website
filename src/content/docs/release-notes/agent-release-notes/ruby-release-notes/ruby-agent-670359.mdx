## v6.7.0

* **Support for Real Time Streaming**

  * Event data is now sent to New Relic every five seconds, instead of every minute. As a result, transaction, error, and custom events will now be available in New Relic and Insights dashboards in near real time. For more information on how to view your events with a five-second refresh, see the [real time streaming documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming).
  * Note that the overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute have not changed. Also, span events, metrics, and trace data is unaffected, and will still be sent every minute.
* **Trace and Entity Metadata API**

  Several new API methods have been added to the agent:

  * [`Agent#linking_metadata`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent#linking_metadata-instance_method)
  * [`Tracer#trace_id`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent/Tracer#trace_id-class_method)
  * [`Tracer#span_id`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent/Tracer#span_id-class_method)
  * [`Tracer#sampled?`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent/Tracer#sampled?-class_method)

  These API methods allow you to access information that can be used to link data of your choosing to a trace or entity.
* **Logs in Context**

  This version of the agent includes a logger, which can be used in place of `::Logger` from the standard library, or `ActiveSupport::Logger` from Rails. This logger leverages the new trace and entity metadata API to decorate log statements with entity and trace metadata, so they can be correlated together in the New Relic UI.

  For more information on how to use logs in context, see [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-ruby](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/enable-logs-context-ruby)
* **Project metadata in Gemspec**

  Project metadata has been added to the gemspec file. This means our Rubygems page will allow users to more easily access the agent's source code, raise issues, and read the changelog.

  Thanks to Orien Madgwick for the contribution!
