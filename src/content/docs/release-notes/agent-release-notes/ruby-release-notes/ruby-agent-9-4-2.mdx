## v9.4.2

Version 9.4.2 of the agent re-addresses the 9.4.0 issue of `NoMethodError` seen when using the `uppy-s3_multipart` gem.

* **Bugfix: Resolve NoMethodError**

  Ruby agent 9.4.1 attempted to fix a `NoMethodError` introduced in 9.4.0. A missing `require` prevented a method from scoping appropriately and has now been added. Thanks to [@spickermann](https://github.com/spickermann) and [@ColinOrr](https://github.com/ColinOrr) for working with us to get this resolved. [PR#2167](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2167)
