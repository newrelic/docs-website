### Notes

* Additional locking option for Resque

  There have been reports of worker process deadlocks in Resque when using the Ruby agent. An optional lock is now available to avoid those deadlocks. See [https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/resque-instrumentation](https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/resque-instrumentation) for more details.
* HTTP connection setup timeout

  HTTP initialization in the agent lacked an appropriate timeout, leading to dropouts in reporting under certain network error conditions.
* Unnecessary requests from Resque jobs

  An issue causing Resque jobs to unnecessarily make requests against New Relic servers was fixed.
