## v8.5.0

* **AWS: Support IMDSv2 by using a token with metadata API calls**

  When querying AWS for instance metadata, include a token in the request headers. If an AWS user configures instances to require a token, the agent will now work. For instances that do not require the inclusion of a token, the agent will continue to work in that context as well.

* **Muffle anticipated stderr warnings for "hostname" calls**

  When using the `hostname` binary to obtain hostname information, redirect STDERR to /dev/null. Thanks very much to @frenkel for raising this issue on behalf of OpenBSD users everywhere and for providing a solution with [PR #965](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/965).

* **Added updated configuration options for transaction events and deprecated previous configs**
  This release deprecates and replaces the following configuration options:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Deprecated
      </th>

      <th>
        Replacement
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        event_report_period.analytic_event_data
      </td>

      <td>
        event_report_period.transaction_event_data
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        analytics_events.enabled
      </td>

      <td>
        transaction_events.enabled
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        analytics_events.max_samples_stored
      </td>

      <td>
        transaction_events.max_samples_stored
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

* **Eliminated warnings for redefined constants in ParameterFiltering**

  Fixed the `ParameterFiltering` constant definitions so that they are not redefined on multiple reloads of the module. Thank you to @TonyArra for bringing this issue to our attention.

* **Docker for development**

  Docker and Docker Compose may now be used for local development and testing with the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the project root. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for usage instructions.


* **Bugfix: Rails 5 + Puma errors in rack "can't add a new key into hash during iteration"**

  When using rails 5 with puma, the agent would intermittently cause rack to raise a `RuntimeError: can't add a new key into hash during iteration`. We have identified the source of the error in our instrumentation and corrected the behavior so it no longer interferes with rack. Thanks to @sasharevzin for bringing attention to this error and providing a reproduction of the issue for us to investigate.

* **CI: target JRuby 9.3.3.0**

  Many thanks to @ahorek for [PR #919](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/919), [PR #921](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/921), and [PR #922](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/922) to keep us up to date on the JRuby side of things. The agent is now actively being tested against JRuby 9.3.3.0. NOTE that this release does not contain any non-CI related changes for JRuby. Old agent versions are still expected to work with newer JRubies, and the newest agent version is still expected to work with older JRubies.

* **CI: Update unit tests for Rails 7.0.2**

  Ensure that the 7.0.2 release of Rails is fully compatible with all relevant tests.

* **CI: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**

  To stay current and secure, our CI automation is now backed by version 20.04 of Ubuntu's long term support offering (previously 18.04).
