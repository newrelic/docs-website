### Notes

* HTTPClient and Curb support

  The Ruby agent now supports the HTTPClient and Curb HTTP libraries! Cross application tracing and more is fully supported for these libraries. For more details see [https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients](https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients).
* Sinatra startup improvements

  In earlier agent versions, newrelic_rpm had to be required after Sinatra to get instrumentation. Now the agent should start when your Sinatra app starts up in rackup, thin, unicorn, or similar web servers.
* Puma clustered mode support

  Clustered mode in Puma was not reporting data without manually adding a hook to Puma's configuration. The agent will now automatically add this hook.
* SSL certificate verification

  Early versions of the agent's SSL support provided an option to skip certificate verification. This option has been removed.
