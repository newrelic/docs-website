### Notes

* Rails 4.0 Support

  The Ruby agent is all set for the recent general release of Rails 4.0! We've been tracking the RC's, and that work paid off. Versions 3.6.5 and 3.6.4 of the Ruby agent should work fine with Rails 4.0.0.
* Excon and Typhoeus support

  The Ruby agent now supports the Excon and Typhoeus HTTP libraries! For more details see [https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients](https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients).
