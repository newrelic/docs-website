### Notes

* Obfuscation for PostgreSQL explain plans

  Fixes an agent bug with PostgreSQL where parameters from the original query could appear in explain plans sent to New Relic servers, even when SQL obfuscation was enabled. Parameters from the query are now masked in explain plans prior to transmission when transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to 'obfuscated' (the default setting).

  For more information, see: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/traces/security-for-postgresql-explain-plans](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/traces/security-for-postgresql-explain-plans)
* More accurate categorization of SQL statements

  Some SQL SELECT statements that were previously being mis-categorized as 'SQL - OTHER' will now correctly be tagged as 'SQL - SELECT'. This particularly affected ActiveRecord users using PostgreSQL.
* More reliable Typhoeus instrumentation

  Fixed an issue where an exception raised from a user-specified on_complete block would cause our Typhoeus instrumentation to fail to record the request.
