### Fixes

* Enabling Memory Profiling on Lion and Mountain Lion

  The agent's list of supported platforms for memory profiling wasn't correctly checking for more recent versions of OS X.
* Fixed an arity issue encountered when calling newrelic_notice_error from Rails applications.
* End user queue time was not being properly reported, works properly now.
* Server-side configuration for ignoring errors was not being heeded by agent.
* Better handling of a thread safety issue.

  Some issues may remain, which we are working to address, but they should be gracefully handled now, rather than crashing the running app.
* Use "java_import" rather than "include_class" when require Java Jars into a JRuby app.

  Thanks to Jan Habermann for the pull request
* Replaced alias_method mechanism with super call in DataMapper instrumentation.

  Thanks to Michael Rykov for the pull request
* Fixed the Rubinius GC profiler.

  Thanks to Dirkjan Bussink
* Use ActiveSupport.on_load to load controller instrumentation Rails 3.

  Thanks to Jonathan del Strother
* Reduce the number of thread local reference in a particular high traffic method

  Thanks to Jeremy Kemper
