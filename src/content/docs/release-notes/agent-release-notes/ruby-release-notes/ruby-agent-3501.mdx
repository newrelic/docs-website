### Fixes

* (performance) Gradual slowdown on Phusion Passenger

  This release resolves a performance issue that effected sites running on some versions of Phusion Passenger. The issue manifests as a slow degradation of response time and increased CPU usage. This issue was only present in version 3.5.0 of the agent.
* Drop support for Passenger versions less than 2.1.1

  In order to implement the above fix we have dropped official support for Passenger versions 2.1.0 and older. These early versions of Passenger do not support an after_fork event which is necessary for the smooth operation of the agent.
