<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read more about [keeping agents up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

  See the New Relic Ruby agent [EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.

## v9.4.0

Version 9.4.0 of the agent adds [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net/) instrumentation, adds a new `allow_all_headers` configuration option to permit capturing all HTTP headers, introduces improved error tracking functionality by associating a transaction id with each error, and uses more reliable network timeout logic.

- **Feature: Add Roda instrumentation**

  [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net/) is a now an instrumented framework. The agent currently supports Roda versions 3.19.0+. [PR#2144](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2144)

- **Feature: New allow_all_headers configuration option**

  A new `allow_all_headers` configuration option brings parity with the [Node.js agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/node-agent-270/) to capture all HTTP request headers.
  
  This configuration option:
    * Defaults to `false`
    * Is not compatible with high security mode
    * Requires Rack version 2 or higher (as does Ruby on Rails version 5 and above) 
    * Respects all existing behavior for the `attributes.include` and `attributes.exclude` [configuration options](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#attributes)
    * Captures the additional headers as attributes prefixed with `request.headers.`
  
  This work was done in response to a feature request submitted by community member [@jamesarosen](https://github.com/jamesarosen). Thank you very much, @jamesarosen! [Issue#1029](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/1029)

- **Feature: Improved error tracking transaction linking**

  Errors tracked and sent to the New Relic errors inbox will now be associated with a transaction id to enable improved UI/UX associations between transactions and errors. [PR#2035](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2035) 

- **Feature: Use Net::HTTP native timeout logic**

  In line with current Ruby best practices, make use of Net::HTTP's own timeout logic and avoid the use of `Timeout.timeout()` when possible. The agent's data transmissions and cloud provider detection routines have been updated accordingly. [PR#2147](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2147)
