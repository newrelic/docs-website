### Notes

* Resolved some issues with tracking of frontend queue time, particularly when the agent is running on an app hosted on Heroku. The agent will now more reliably parse the headers described in [https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time](https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time) and will automatically detect whether the times provided are in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
