### Notes

* Resolved some issues with tracking of front-end queue time, particularly when the agent is running on an app hosted on Heroku. The agent will now more reliably parse the headers described in [https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time](https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time) and will automatically detect whether the times provided are in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
