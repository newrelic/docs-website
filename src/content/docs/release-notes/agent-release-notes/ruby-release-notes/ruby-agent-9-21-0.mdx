## v9.21.0

- **Feature: In Serverless APM mode, use event source name as transaction name prefix**

  The agent will now use the event source name as a prefix for the transaction name in Serverless APM mode. This will help to better identify the source of the transaction in the New Relic UI. [PR#3245](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3245)

- **Bugfix: Revert changed logic for how we track the thread the span starts in**

  This change restores the previous behavior of tracking the thread the span starts in, addressing issues that arose from the updated logic. Thank you [@david-zw-liu](https://github.com/david-zw-liu) for bringing this to our attention. [PR#3248](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3248)
