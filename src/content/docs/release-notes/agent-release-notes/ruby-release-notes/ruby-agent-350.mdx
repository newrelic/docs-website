### Fixes

* (Fix) RUM Stops Working After 3.4.2.1 Agent Upgrade

  v3.4.2.1 introduced a bug that caused the browser monitor auto instrumentation (for RUM) default to be false. The correct value of true is now used
* When the Ruby Agent detects Unicorn as the dispatcher it creates an INFO level log message with additional information

  To help customers using Unicorn, if the agent detects it (Unicorn) is being used as the dispatcher an INFO level log message it created that includes a link to New Relic online doc that has additional steps that may be required to get performance data reporting.
* (Fix) In version 3.4.2 of the Ruby Agent the server side value for Apdex T was disgregarded

  With version 3.4.2 of the agent, the value set in the newrelic.yml file took precedence over the value set in the New Relic UI. As of version 3.5.0 only the value for Apdex T set in the New Relic UI will be used. Any setting in the yaml file will be ignored.
* Improved Error Detection/Reporting capabilities for Rails 3 apps

  Some errors are missed by the agent's exception reporting handlers because they are generated in the rails stack, outside of the instrumented controller action. A Rack middleware is now included that can detect these errors as they bubble out of the middleware stack. Note that this does not include Routing Errors.
* The Ruby Agent now logs certain information it receives from the New Relic servers

  After connecting to the New Relic servers the agent logs the New Relic URL of the app it is reporting to.
* GC profiling overhead for Ruby 1.9 reduced

  For Ruby 1.9 the amount of time spent in GC profiling has been reduced.
* Know issue with Ruby 1.8.7-p334, sqlite3-ruby 1.3.0 or older, and resque 1.23.0

  The Ruby Agent will not work in conjunction with Ruby 1.8.7-p334, sqlite3-ruby 1.3.3 or earlier, and resque 1.23.0. Your app will likely stop functioning. This is a known problem with Ruby versions up to 1.8.7-p334. Upgrading to the last release of Ruby 1.8.7 is recommended. This issue has been present in every version of the agent we've tested going back for a year.
