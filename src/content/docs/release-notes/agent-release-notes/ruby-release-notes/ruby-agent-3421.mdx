### Fixes

* Fix issue when app_name is nil

  If the app_name setting ends up being nil an exception got generated and the application wouldn't run. This would notably occur when running a Heroku app locally without the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable set. A nil app_name is now detected and an error logged specifying remediation.
