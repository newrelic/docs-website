### Notes

* Key Transactions

  The Ruby agent now supports Key Transactions! Check out more details on the feature at [https://newrelic.com/docs/site/key-transactions](https://newrelic.com/docs/site/key-transactions).
* Ruby 2.0

  The Ruby agent is compatible with Ruby 2.0.0 which was just released.
* Improved Sinatra instrumentation

  Several cases around the use of conditions and pass in Sinatra are now better supported by the Ruby agent. Thanks Konstantin for the help!
* Cross Application Tracing

  See [https://newrelic.com/docs/features/cross-application-traces](https://newrelic.com/docs/features/cross-application-traces) for details. Adds a 'X-NewRelic-ID' header to outbound Net::HTTP requests. This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services in a service- oriented architecture.
* Automatically detect Resque dispatcher

  The agent does better auto-detection for the Resque worker process. This should reduce the need to set NEW_RELIC_DISPATCHER=resque directly.
