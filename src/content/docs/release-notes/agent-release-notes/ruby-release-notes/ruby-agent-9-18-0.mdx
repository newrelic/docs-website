<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read more about [keeping agents up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

  See the New Relic Ruby agent [EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.

## v9.18.0

- **Feature: Add elasticsearch.capture_cluster_name configuration option**

  A new configuration option, `elasticsearch.capture_cluster_name`, has been added to control capturing Elasticsearch cluster names. Cluster names are captured by default, but can now be disabled as needed. [PR#3038](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3038)

- **Feature: Add support for sidekiq-delay_extensions**

  Sidekiq delay extensions were removed from Sidekiq in 7.x and are now avaliable through the [sidekiq-delay_extensions](https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq-delay_extensions) gem. Thanks to [@sobrinho](https://github.com/sobrinho), the agent now has continued support for delay extensions.[PR#3056](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3056)

- **Feature: Parallelize calls for vendor metadata**

  Previously, the agent would make calls for vendor metadata in a serial fashion. This could lead to a delay in starting the agent. Now, the agent will make these calls in parallel, reducing the time it takes to start the agent. [PR#3094](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3094)

- **Bugfix: Prevent a nil segment from causing errors in Net::HTTP instrumentation**

  When using JRuby, a race condition can happen that causes the segment creation to fail and return `nil`. This would cause an error to occur when methods were later called on the `nil` segment. These methods will no longer be called if the segment is `nil`, preventing that error from occurring. [PR#3046](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3046)

- **Bugfix: JRuby multithreading improvements**

  Added some additional nil checks and mutexes to prevent issues when using the agent on JRuby with multiple threads. Thanks to @NC-piercej for bringing this to our attention [Issue#3021](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/3021) [PR#3053](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3053)

- **Bugfix: Stop reporting rescued Sidekiq::OverLimit exceptions**

  When Sidekiq's concurrent rate limiters encounter an `OverLimit` exception, Sidekiq typically handles this by re-enqueuing the job. Previously, all occurrences of `Sidekiq::OverLimit` were logged as errors in New Relic, even when Sidekiq's middleware resolved the exception. New Relic will no longer report errors that are handled by Sidekiq's own middleware. Thanks to [@97jaz](https://github.com/97jaz) for reporting this issue. [Issue#3037](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/3037) [PR#3047](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3047)

- **Bugfix: Protect against nil agents or health checks**

  In some cases the agent or health checks may be `nil` when they are called. Safe navigation operators have been added for protection on those occasions. [PR#3049](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3049)

- **Bugfix: Ignore Solid Queue `ThreadError: queue empty` error message by default**

  When using the solid_queue gem, the agent previously generated excessive warn-level logs when the queue was empty. The agent now ignores `queue empty` error messages of the `ThreadError` class by default. This behavior can be adjusted using the `error_collector.ignore_messages` configuration option. [PR#3060](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3060)

- **Bugfix: Refactor URI host handling to accommodate downcasing frozen strings**

  When URI host string was frozen, a FrozenError would be raised when the agent attempted to downcase the host as part of its data normalization process. Now, the update is friendly for frozen strings. Thank you [@pedrol3001](https://github.com/pedrol3001) for your contribution! [PR#3097](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/3097)
