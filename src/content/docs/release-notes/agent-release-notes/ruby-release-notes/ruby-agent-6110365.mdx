# New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes

## v6.11.0

* **Infinite Tracing**

  This release adds support for [Infinite Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing). Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data. With Infinite Tracing, you get examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems.

  Configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. View distributed traces through New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network.

  Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative.
* **Bugfix: Cross Application Tracing (CAT) adds a missing field to response**

  Previously, the CAT header was missing a reserved field that would lead to an error in the Go Agent's processing of incoming headers from the Ruby Agent. This fix adds that missing field to the headers.
* **Bugfix: Environment Report now supports Rails >= 6.1**

  The API changed for how database connections are accessed in Rails versions starting with 6.1 to support multiple database feature. The Environment report was enhanced to use the Rails >= 6.1 API with fallback to old API when that fails.

  Thanks to Sébastien Dubois (sedubois) for reporting this issue and contribution!
* **Bugfix: Eliminate warnings appearing when using `add_method_tracer` with Ruby 2.7**

  Previously, using `add_method_tracer` with Ruby 2.7 to trace a method that included keyword arguments resulted in warning messages: `warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated; maybe ** should be added to the call`. These messages no longer appear.

  Thanks to Harm de Wit and Atsuo Fukaya for reporting the issue!
* **Added distributed tracing to Sidekiq jobs**

  Thanks to andreaseger for the contribution!
