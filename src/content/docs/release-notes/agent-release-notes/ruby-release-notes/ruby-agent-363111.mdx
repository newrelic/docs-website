### Notes

* Better Sinatra Support

  A number of improvements have been made to our Sinatra instrumentation. More details: [https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sinatra-support-in-the-ruby-agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sinatra-support-in-the-ruby-agent)

  Sinatra instrumentation has been updated to more accurately reflect the final route that was actually executed, taking pass and conditions into account.

  New Relic middlewares for error collection, real user monitoring, and cross application tracing are automatically inserted into the middleware stack.

  Ignoring routes, similar to functionality available to Rails controllers, is now available in Sinatra as well.

  Routes in 1.4 are properly formatting in transaction names. Thanks Zachary Anker for the contribution!
* Padrino Support

  Along with improving our support of Sinatra, we've also extended that to supporting Padrino, a framework that builds on Sinatra. Web transactions should show up in New Relic now for Padrino apps automatically. The agent has been tested against the latest Padrino in versions 0.11.x and 0.10.x.
* Main overview graph only shows web transactions

  In the past database times from background jobs mixed with other web transaction metrics in the main overview graph. This often skewed graphs. A common workaround was to send background jobs to a separate application, but that should no longer be necessary as the overview graphs now only represent web transactions.
