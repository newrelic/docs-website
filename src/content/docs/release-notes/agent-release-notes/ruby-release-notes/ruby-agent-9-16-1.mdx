## v9.16.1

- **Bugfix: Added the support for the Trilogy database adapter.**

  The agent now fully supports the Trilogy, a client library for MySQL-compatible database servers, and correctly lists MySQL as the corresponding database in the UI. [PR#2966](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2966).
