## v9.7.1

Version 9.7.1 fixes a ViewComponent instrumentation bug and enforces maximum size limits for custom event attributes.

* **Bugfix: Stop suppressing ViewComponent errors**

  Previously, the agent suppressed ViewComponent render errors. The agent now reports these errors and allows them to raise. Thank you [@mjacobus](https://github.com/mjacobus) for reporting this bug and providing a fix! [PR#2410](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2410)

* **Bugfix: Enforce maximum size limits for custom event attributes**

  Previously, the agent would allow custom event attributes to be any size. This would lead to the New Relic backend dropping attributes larger than the maximum size. Now, the agent will truncate custom event attribute values to 4095 characters, attribute names to 255 characters, and the total count of attributes to 64. [PR#2401](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/2401)
