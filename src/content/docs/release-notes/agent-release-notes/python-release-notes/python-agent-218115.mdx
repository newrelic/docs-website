### Notes

This release of the Python agent adds improved audit logging functionality and an admin script sub command for recording deployments.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Features

* **Record Deployments**: A new 'record-deploy' sub command has been added to the 'newrelic-admin' script installed with the Python agent. This is a wrapper around the HTTP API provided by New Relic for [recording deployments](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/applications-menu/deployments-dashboard) against your application. To use the sub command, add your API-KEY in the agent configuration file under the 'api_key' setting. The path to the config file, description for the deploy and optional revision, change log and user information can then be supplied as arguments to the sub command.
* **Audit Logging**: An improved audit logging feature has been added to the agent for capturing details of what is being sent up to our data collectors. Information is now captured into a separate log file in a more human-readable format to aid any review process carried out to determine what the agent is sending. The audit logging feature can be enabled by setting the the 'audit_log_file' setting in the agent configuration file, or the 'NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG' environment variable. It is not recommended that audit logging be enabled for any extended period as the resulting log file will be quite large.

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* The agent now ensures that the certificate bundle packaged with the agent is always used when certifying SSL connections back to our data collector. Previously the location of the certificate bundle could be overridden by a number of environment variables. This could cause SSL connection failures when the referenced certificate bundle didn't exist or had incorrect permissions and could not be accessed.
