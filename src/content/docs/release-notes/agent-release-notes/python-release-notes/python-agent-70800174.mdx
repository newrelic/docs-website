## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for GraphQL Server, adds a log handler which forwards logs to the New Relic API, and increases functionality to `notice_error`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for GraphQL Server**
  The agent will now automatically instrument and send metrics for applications using the GraphQL Server.

* **Add a Log Handler**
  The agent is now able to forward logs to the New Relic API.  Thank you to [iamr0b0tx](https://github.com/iamr0b0tx) for your contribution!

## Changes

* **More Robust `should_ignore_error` calls**
  Pass references to settings where possible to `should_ignore_error` and makes custom `_nr_ignored` logic more defined and incorporated into `notice_error`.
