## Notes

This release of the Python agent contains bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **The creation of sampled events sometimes raised an exception in Python 3**

  When more events (Transaction, Transaction Error, Custom, or Span) were created than allowed per harvest period in Python 3, sometimes a `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'` was raised. This issue has now been fixed.
