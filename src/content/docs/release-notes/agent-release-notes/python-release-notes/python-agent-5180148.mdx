## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds new ASGI apis and upgrades wrapt.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Adds support for ASGI applications via built in APIs**

  This version of the agent ships with wrapt 1.12.1.
