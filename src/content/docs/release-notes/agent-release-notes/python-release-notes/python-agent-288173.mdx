## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes for the [pika RabbitMQ library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika) [instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/use-rabbitmq-message-queues).

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## Bug Fixes

* **Using pika to make RPC-style calls from Tornado could result in an application crash**

  When making a remote procedure call from a tornado web application using the pika RabbitMQ library's Tornado connection, it is possible for the tornado web application to crash. Pika Tornado connections no longer result in an application crash.
* **AttributeError generated from an unregistered application starting a MessageTransaction**

  Applications which consume message transactions and do not call `register_application` can raise an AttributeError resulting in an application crash. This issue has now been fixed.
