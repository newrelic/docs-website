## Notes

This release of the Python agent deprecates the old `record_exception` API, replaces the `error_collector.ignore_errors` setting, adds a new `notice_error` API, adds [expected errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#expected) functionality, improves the NewRelicContextFormatter, and fixes multiple bugs including a few potential crashes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Deprecated `record_exception` API**

  `record_exception` has been superseded by the new `notice_error` API. The old API will forward exceptions to `notice_error` with a deprecation warning.

* **Deprecated `error_collector.ignore_errors` setting**

  `error_collector.ignore_errors` has been replaced with `error_collector.ignore_classes` to match other agents. Please update your config files to use the new setting. The old setting will continue to function with a deprecation warning.

## New Features

* **Added new `notice_error` API**

  This new API falls much more in line with [other language agents](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#error-collection).

  It also includes [expected errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#expected) functionality and a status code parameter.

  To see all changes, view the [documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/noticeerror-python-agent-api/) for this API.


* **Added new expected errors feature**

  This feature implements [expected errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#expected) as documented here. To enable them, use the following new settings.

  * [`error_collector.expected_classes`](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#error-expected)
  * [`error_collector.expected_status_codes`](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#error-expected-status-codes)

## Improved Features

* **Improved NewRelicContextFormatter**

  Adds new `log_record_to_dict` function to separate logic for JSON serialization and converting to a dictionary, enabling custom formatters to access the data more easily.

  Custom attributes now attempt JSON serialization by default and fallback to strings, meaning dictionaries and other serializable types are now supported.

  Thank you to [@chrislawlor](https://github.com/chrislawlor) and [@qvik-olli](https://github.com/qvik-olli) for your contributions!

* **`error_collector.ignore_status_codes` is now configurable in server-side configuration**

  Previously this setting was only available in the config file, but is now available via server-side configuration.

## Bug Fixes

* **Infinite tracing crash fix**

  Crashes had occurred in infinite tracing following the inclusion of some startup timeout changes in v6.0.0. These changes have been rolled back.

* **RuntimeInstrumentationError crash removed**

  Crashes occurred when a `RuntimeInstrumentationError` was reached, indicating a potential problem with existing instrumentation. The exception is now caught and replaced with error level log messages to avoid crashing applications.

* **SQLite instrumentation consumes generator objects passed to `executemany`**

  A generator passed to `Connection.executemany` would unexpectedly be consumed by our instrumentation. This has been corrected and generators are now properly supported.

## Known Issues

* **Flask v2.0.0 support**

  Flask released a new major version recently that we do not yet support, but expect to in the near future.

* **Sanic support**

  Sanic has released large changes to the framework recently that have broken some of our instrumentation on certain versions, and can crash the agent on others. We expect to correct these issues in the near future.
