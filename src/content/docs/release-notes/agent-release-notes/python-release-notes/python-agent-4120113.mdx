## Notes

This release of the Python agent extends support of Amazon's [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) library and includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **AWS operation and request ID will now be reported in transaction traces and spans when using boto3 and botocore.**

  The agent will now report `aws.requestId` and `aws.operation` for all calls to AWS made using botocore and boto3.
* **DynamoDB calls are now reported under the Databases tab.**

  The agent will now record DynamoDB query performance in the Databases tab in APM in addition to table name for the following calls:

  * put_item
  * get_item
  * update_item
  * delete_item
  * create_table
  * delete_table
  * query
  * scan
* **Certain SQS calls will now report additional data for spans and transaction traces.**

  The agent will now record the queue name in spans and transaction traces for the following SQS calls:

  * send_message
  * send_message_batch
  * receive_message
* **SNS publish will now report additional data for spans and transaction traces.**

  The SNS topic, target, or the string literal PhoneNumber will be reported to New Relic inside of spans and transaction traces.
* **The full URL path will now be recorded on span events and transaction traces when using boto3 or botocore.**

  The agent will now record the full URL path for API calls made to AWS through the boto3 / botocore libraries. The path will be available through span events and transaction traces.

## Bug Fixes

* **Using newrelic-admin to start a GunicornWebWorker with an aiohttp application factory resulted in an application crash.**

  The agent would fail to start if using the newrelic-admin command to start an aiohttp application factory with GunicornWebWorker. This issue has now been fixed.
