## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds instrumentation for [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and [asyncpg](https://pypi.org/project/asyncpg/).

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Adds uvicorn instrumentation**

  ASGI applications are now automatically wrapped when using the uvicorn ASGI server.

* **Adds asyncpg instrumentation**

  Support has been added for recording database transactions when using asyncpg database client module for PostgresSQL.

## Improved Features

* **Adds db.operation attribute**

  A new attribute, db.operation, was introduced for datastore traces. This value is recorded only when db.statement is not reported, and represents an operation triggered by methods other than running a DB statement.
