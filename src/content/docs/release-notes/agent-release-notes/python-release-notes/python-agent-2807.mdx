### Notes

This release of the Python agent marks the official introduction of support for pypy. Instrumentation has also been updated to address issues arising from the release of Celery 3.1.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Features:

* The agent has worked with and has already been used by customers with pypy for some time, but we have not officially acknowledged that we support pypy. We have now integrated pypy into our test procedures and now officially support this implementation of the Python language.

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* Instrumentation for Celery has been updated to accommodate changes in Celery 3.1. The changes in Celery 3.1 resulted in no metrics being reported in prior versions of the agent.
* When collecting data on external web service calls, the agent now drops port 80/443 from the name of the host when used with the standard http/https protocol schemes. This ensures that a URL with or without the ports are seen as the same service in the external web services page in the UI.
* When using newrelic.agent.initialize() explicitly, if no arguments are provided, the values for the config file and environment arguments will now be read from the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE and NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT arguments if specified.
* Flask instrumentation was not correctly mapping URLs related to a HTTP 404 response to a known framework or application handler function. Instead the web transaction was named after the URL, which could result in metric grouping issues if an application was hit with a large number of URLs which couldn't be mapped by the application. Such requests will now be mapped to flask.app:Flask.handle_http_exception.
* Pyramid instrumentation should no longer report as errors instances of exceptions derived from HTTPRedirection, raised to generate a HTTP redirect response.
* Improvements to the newrelic-admin wrapper script and agent bootstrapping procedure to better deal with a local sitecustomize.py file. Changes will also better handle the case where the newrelic-admin wrapper script was used around a Python script using a different Python installation than that which the newrelic package was installed in, avoiding possible errors when the wrapped script was run, due to the mismatch.
