## Notes

This release of the Python agent introduces distributed tracing, adds improvement to our Pyramid instrumentation, adds support for custom CA bundles, and contains bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Distributed tracing support**

  Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.

  Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the [transition guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) before you enable this feature.

  To enable distributed tracing, add `distributed_tracing.enabled = true` to your newrelic.ini file or use the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true`.
* **Add support for tracing Pyramid tweens**

  [Pyramid tweens](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/glossary.html#term-tween) are now automatically timed and added to the transaction detail view. The time spent in a Pyramid tween will be displayed in the transaction breakdown table and in the trace details of a transaction trace.
* **Provide configuration option for custom CA bundle**

  Customers can now use the `ca_bundle_path` configuration option or set the `NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH` environment variable to set the path to a local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service.

## Bug Fixes

* **Custom Insights event data attached to transactions in excess of 100 events were omitted**

  The agent may have failed to send custom event data (record_custom_event) to insights when recorded as part of a Transaction containing over 100 custom events. This issue has now been corrected.
