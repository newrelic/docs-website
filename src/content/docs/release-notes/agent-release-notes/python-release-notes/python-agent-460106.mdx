## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes changes to the agent to enable monitoring of Lambda functions, improves the built-in Sanic instrumentation, and includes various bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Monitoring of Lambda functions**

  This release includes changes to the agent to enable monitoring of Lambda functions. If you are interested in learning more or previewing New Relic Lambda monitoring please email [lambda_preview@newrelic.com](mailto:lambda_preview@newrelic.com).
* **Improve naming of Sanic HTTPMethodView view handlers**

  Sanic views that were defined using the HTTPMethodView class were previously all named `HTTPMethodView.as_view.<locals>.view` regardless of the actual class in use. The agent will now name transactions after the actual view handler class.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix ignored error reporting in CherryPy instrumention**

  When missing query parameters, unexpected query parameters, unexpected positional arguments, or duplicate arguments were present in the CherryPy framework, a TypeError exception was recorded even when an ignored response status code (such as a 404) was generated. An error is no longer recorded when it results in the generation of an ignored status code.
* **Excluding `request.uri` from transaction trace attributes hides it in the UI**

  When `request.uri` is added to either `attributes.exclude` or `transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude`, the value will now no longer be sent to New Relic.
* **Ability to disable sending `request.uri` as part of error traces**

  When `request.uri` is added to either `attributes.exclude` or `error_collector.attributes.exclude`, the value will now no longer be sent to New Relic.
* **Fix tracing of functions returning generators**

  When tracing generators whose parent traces have ended an error was seen in the logs "Transaction ended but current_node is not Sentinel." This has now been fixed.
