## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) and `redis.asyncio` connections.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)**
  The Python agent now supports monitoring for machine learning models created with sklearn. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-mlops/) for details on how to view and query for your prediction events and ML related metrics directly in the New Relic user interface. Machine learning instrumentation will be disabled by default in this release. To enable it, visit our [configuration page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#ml-settings) for further information.
  This release also introduces two new APIs to support customization of machine learning monitoring: [wrap_mlmodel](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/wrapmlmodel-python-agent-api/) and [record_ml_event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/recordmlevent-python-agent-api/).

* **Add instrumentation for `redis.asyncio.Connection`**
  Add instrumentation support for connections initiated from the `redis.asyncio` module

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
