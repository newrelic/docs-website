### Notes

This release of the Python agent contains improvements in the way that queueing time is calculated.

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* Resolved some issues with tracking of front-end queue time, particularly when the agent is running on an app hosted on Heroku. The agent will now more reliably parse the headers described in [https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time](https://newrelic.com/docs/features/tracking-front-end-time) and will automatically detect whether the times provided are in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
