### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem with the Tornado 4 instrumentation for `curl_httpclient` introduced in our last release (v2.80.0.60). Under the circumstances described below, calling `CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl()` could result in an agent error.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

### Bug Fix

* **Fix CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() instrumentation**

  If `fetch_impl()` was called by passing the `request` argument positionally, but passing `callback` as a keyword argument, then the agent would throw an error. In practice, this only affected customers who implemented a custom version of `fetch_impl()`, but for those affected customers, this is now fixed.
