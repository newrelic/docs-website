## Notes

This release of the Python agent contains security related updates as well as bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Security Updates

See the associated security bulletins for [custom API parameters in high security mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-01) and for [SQL params for SQLite](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-01).

## Bug Fixes

* **Using the aiohttp client may result in an application crash**

  Under certain circumstances, using the aiohttp client may have resulted in an application crash. This issue has been addressed.
* **Database queries made with psycopg2 may not have been recorded**

  When using the "with" statement to create a cursor, time spent on database calls may not have been properly recorded. This issue has been addressed.
* **Usage of the pika library resulted in a memory leak**

  When using the pika library with New Relic, Channel objects would not be cleared from memory as expected. This would result in abnormally high memory utilization in some cases. The memory leak has now been fixed.
* **DeprecationWarning generated for async/await keywords**

  Using the agent may have generated a DeprecationWarning around async/await being reserved keywords. The DeprecationWarning should no longer be generated.
