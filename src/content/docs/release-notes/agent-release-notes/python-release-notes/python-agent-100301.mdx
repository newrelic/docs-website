## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a bug in the package version collector that disabled telemetry from being sent to New Relic in certain cases.
 
Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).
    
## Bug fixes

* Fix agent crash when uploading package version info

  * Previously, if package versioning was a class property then the function itself was sent with the payload. This would then display the `__repr__()` of the versioning class in the environment stats. In v10.3.0, this task was tweaked and moved to the harvest cycle that caused a failure during the payload conversion to JSON and disabled the telemetry transmission. This release introduces logic to exclude invalid data types from the module payload.
  
## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
