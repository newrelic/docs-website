## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [Google Cloud Firestore](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-firestore/).

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Enhancements

* **Add support for Firestore**
  Adds instrumentation support for [Google Cloud Firestore](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-firestore/).

* **Add support to Redis Async**
  Adds instrumentation support for Redis' async features.  Thanks, [ahmedhr](https://github.com/ahmedhr) and [bc291](https://github.com/bc291) for your contribution!

* **Automatic wrapping for async generators**
  Existing tracing decorator APIs now support async generators out of the box.

## Bug fixes

* **Fixed a crash when consecutive calls to `throw()` on wrapped generators**
  Previously consecutive calls to `throw()` would raise an exception rather than inject the exception into the wrapped generator.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
