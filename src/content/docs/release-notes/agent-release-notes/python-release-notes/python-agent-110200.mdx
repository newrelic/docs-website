## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for the following:
  * [Strands](https://pypi.org/project/strands-agents-tools/)
  * [AWS Bedrock Converse Streaming]((https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-runtime/client/converse.html))
  * [Redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) methods `hybrid_search` and `msetex`
  * [Langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) role assignments for LLM events
  * LLM event timestamp captured at time of LLM request 
  * `loop_factory` parameter in `asyncio.Runner`

This release also addresses a bug in ASGI instrumentation where headers are not reported by the web server.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic), using `conda` via the [Conda-Forge Package Index](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/newrelic), or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).


## Features

* Add support for [Strands](https://pypi.org/project/strands-agents-tools/) 

  * Add instrumentation for Strands tools and agents in single and multi-agent (swarms, graphs, etc.) setups

* Add support for [AWS Bedrock Converse Streaming](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-runtime/client/converse.html)

  * Add monitoring support for streaming Converse API. This includes support for Converse chat completion calls made with boto3 and aioboto3 clients using `converse_stream()`.

* Add support for [Redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) methods

  * Add support for the following methods:
	* `hybrid_search`
	* `msetex`

* Add support for `loop_factory` in `asyncio.Runner`

  * In Python 3.11, the `asyncio.Runner` class was added as well as the `loop_factory` parameter. The `loop_factory` parameter provides a replacement for loop policies.  Now, the loop that is created is instrumented, regardless of whether it is through a global event loop setting or a custom event loop.

* Capture [Langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) role assignments in LLM events

  * Langchain `LlmChatCompletionMessage` events now contains the assigned role from [Langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/).
	
* Capture LLM event timestamp at time of LLM request

  * Previously, the LLM event's timestamp was captured at the time of event creation. Now, it is more accurately captured at the time of the LLM request.


## Bug fixes

* ASGI header consumption

  * When an `ASGIWebTransaction` consumes the headers from a `http.response.start` event, it was doing so without regard to the allowable input types. When the headers are a generator, the generator was consumed by the call to `process_response()` leaving no headers remaining for the web server to send.  This has now been fixed.


## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
