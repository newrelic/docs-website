## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes improvements to distributed tracing, and bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add new span attribute transaction.name**

  A new attribute, `transaction.name`, has been added to the root span.

## Improved features

* **Transaction attributes are added to the root span**

  Transaction attributes, including response attributes, are now added to the root span.

* **Custom attributes are added to the root span**

  The public API methods `newrelic.agent.add_custom_param` and `newrelic.agent.add_custom_params` now add the specified custom attribute to the root span in addition to the transaction. If the maximum number of custom attributes is reached, span-level custom attributes take precedence over transaction-level custom attributes.

* **Error attributes added to each span/segment**

  Error attributes `error.class` and `error.message` to all spans that exit without handling an exception.

## Bug fixes

* **asyncio: application crash when a transaction that started on a completed parent task exits**

  When a transaction that started on a completed parent task exited, an exception was raised. This error has been fixed.

* **Error attributes are no longer added if the error collector is disabled**

  If the error collector is disabled via error_collector.enabled, error attributes `error.class` and `error.message` are not added to the currently executing span.

## Security Updates

Note that changes were made that add attributes to the root span. Transaction-level attribute filtering via the transaction.attribute.exclude configuration setting will not filter the attribute(s) for the root span. Those attributes may unexpectedly start to appear on the root span.
