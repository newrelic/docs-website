## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for monitoring of outbound gRPC requests and adds an API for cross application tracing of custom non-HTTP transports. For details on APIs for cross application tracing see the cross application tracing document.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index  or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add API for cross application tracing of non-HTTP external services** 

  A new API is now exposed for implementing cross application tracing in custom instrumentation of non-HTTP transport libraries. For usage of this API see the cross application tracing document. 
* **Add instrumentation for gRPC client calls** 

  Outbound gRPC requests will now show up in APM under the External Services tab and in transaction traces. 

## Bug Fixes

* **Fixes erroneous recording of TastyPie `NotFound` exceptions**

   When a TastyPie API view raised a NotFound exception resulting in a 404 response, the agent may have erroneously recorded the exception. This has now been fixed.
