## Notes

This release of the Python agent:

* Adds instrumentation for [AIOBotocore](https://pypi.org/project/aiobotocore/)
* Adds support for Meta Llama3 and Mistral AI in <DNT>Amazon Bedrock</DNT>
* Fixes an error parsing issue in [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
* Updates [Loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/)'s instrumentation to use milliseconds instead of seconds

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add [AIOBotocore](https://pypi.org/project/aiobotocore/) instrumentation**

  * Add instrumentation for AIOBotocore.  Supports proxy mode in addition to standard operation.

* **Add new <DNT>Amazon Bedrock</DNT> models**

  * Add instrumentation for the following <DNT>Amazon Bedrock</DNT> models:
    * Meta Llama3
    * Mistral AI

## Bug fixes

* **Fix [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) error parsing**

  * Previously, if an error in OpenAI was encountered, the Python Agent would attempt to override the default `error.message` within `notice_error()` with the one used in OpenAI.  However, if there was no `message` attribute in the error, the Python Agent would crash.  Now it defaults to the original methodology of error handling by the Python Agent.

* **Record timing in [Loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/) in milliseconds**

  * Timing in Loguru is recorded as an integer and if that value was less than 1 second, it would record it as 0s.  This changes the units to be in milliseconds instead.  Thanks, (@julia-tadej-wwtech)[https://github.com/julia-tadej-wttech] for the contribution!

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
