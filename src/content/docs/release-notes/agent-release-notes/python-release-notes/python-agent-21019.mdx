### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hot fix version to address an issue related to [cross process application traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/traces/cross-application-traces) introduced in 2.10.0.8.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directory from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* The value of headers inserted into the HTTP response returned from the WSGI application to support cross process application tracing were being incorrectly passed as Unicode strings on Python 2. This would cause a strictly compliant WSGI server such as Apache/mod_wsgi or uWSGI to raise an error when the headers were being set. In general, pure Python WSGI servers are not as strict in their WSGI compliance and would have silently accepted the value anyway, converting it to a byte string using the Python system default encoding.
