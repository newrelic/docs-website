## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and fixes import logic for `importlib.metadata` and `pkg_resources`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add support for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

  * Adds support for MCP calls in [mcp](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) and [fastmcp](https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/). The agent will now automatically instrument the following core MCP primitives:
    * Tools (via `call_tool`)
    * Resources (via `read_resource`)
    * Prompts (via `get_prompt`)

## Bug fixes

* Fix import logic for `importlib.metadata` and `pkg_resources`

  * Updates logic around import of `importlib.metadata` to also attempt to use the `importlib_metadata` backport before falling back to `pkg_resources.*`. This also removes use of `sys.version` conditionals and fixes issues where Python 3.9 could only use `pkg_resources` despite having `importlib.metadata` available.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
