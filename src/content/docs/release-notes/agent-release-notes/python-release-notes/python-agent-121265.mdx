### Bug fixes:

* Fix assertion violations when greenlets were used explicitly in the context of a normal thread based request handler.
* Installation of package using Python 2.5 was giving warnings when trying to byte code compile installed .py files due to missing import for 'with_statement' from \_\_future\_\_ module in some modules.
* The newrelic-admin script is now installed correctly when installing the package as an egg under buildout.
* The newrelic.agent.stop_recording() function was causing errors when using any WSGI hosting mechanism other than Apache/mod_wsgi and wasn't working as intended even under mod_wsgi.
* Disable CPU sampling when os.times() is not available, such as when using Jython.
* Derivation of name when instrumenting the \_\_init\_\_() method of a class could fail if the class had a \_\_len\_\_() method which accessed methods/attributes which were only setup during the constructor.
* Move importing of multiprocessing module to global scope to avoid [logging module bug](http://bugs.python.org/issue8200) in Python versions up to 2.6.
