## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds supported builds for Python 3.10 and fixes bugs.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add Python 3.10 wheels**

  Wheels for Python 3.10 are now available and supported.

## Changes

* **Upgrade internal urllib3 to v1.26.7**

  The internal copy of urllib3 has been upgraded to v1.26.7 to address Python 3.10 issues and deprecation warnings.

## Bug Fixes

* **Ensure errors are ignored by server-side config**

  Previously it was possible on transaction exit to have an error fail to be ignored when the settings were supplied via server-side config. This has been fixed.

* **Deprecation warnings for imp module removed**

  The `imp` module has been deprecated for some time, and has been issuing warnings. This module has been replaced with `importlib` when available.

  Older versions of Python may still require the use of `imp`, but no deprecation warnings should be emitted.
