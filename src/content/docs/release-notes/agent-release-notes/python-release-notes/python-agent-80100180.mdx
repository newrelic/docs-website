## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds automatic instrumentation for Hypercorn, and includes bug fixes for Sanic v21.9+, memory sampler reporting, and database traces.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add Hypercorn instrumentation**

    Instrumentation has been added for [Hypercorn](https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn/), an ASGI web server.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix instrumentation for Sanic v21.9+**

    Instrumentation for newer versions of Sanic (>=21.9) have either not reported data or crashed due to an incompatibility with Sanic's internal metaprogramming.

* **Fix incorrect PID reported by memory sampler**

    The PID reported by the memory sampler when sampling processes was incorrectly attributed to the process the agent was initialized from.

* **Fix issue with database traces causing crashes**

    In rare instances a database trace could result in a setting not being found, causing a crash.
