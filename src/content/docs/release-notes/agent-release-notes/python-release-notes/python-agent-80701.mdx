## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for a new config option to capture GraphQL introspection query transactions.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for a new config option to capture GraphQL introspection query transactions.**

  Added new config setting instrumentation.graphql.capture_introspection_queries and corresponding environment variable NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_GRAPHQL_CAPTURE_INTROSPECTION_QUERIES to control capturing of GraphQL introspection transactions. Defaults to false which retains previous behavior of ignoring transactions with introspection queries. 

## Bug fixes
* **Fixed introspection query recognition for GraphQL.**

  Fixed introspection query recognition for GraphQL to allow introspection fields to be queried alongside real fields in traces.
