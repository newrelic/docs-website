## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug fixes

* **When using newrelic-admin run-program on Python 2.7 applications failed to start**

  Using the newrelic-admin run-program on Python 2.7 with the 5.14.0 agent resulted in an application crash. Applications now start as expected on Python 2.7.
