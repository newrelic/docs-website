## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for the following:

  * Custom tasks in [Celery](https://pypi.org/project/celery/)
  * [Graphene-Django](https://pypi.org/project/graphene-django/) monitoring
  * Middleware filtering in [Django](https://pypi.org/project/django/)
  * AWS Bedrock [Converse](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-runtime/client/converse.html) API
  
This release also provides the following fixes:

  * Safeguards for the deepest unique path in GraphQL
  * Safeguards for web URL request parsing
  * Fallback for ElasticSearch and GraphQL when `trace.settings==None`
  * Remove `options` method from async ElasticSearch client list

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Adds support for custom tasks in Celery

  * Add monitoring support for custom task classes in [Celery](https://pypi.org/project/celery/).  Previously, only tasks using the default task class were able to be monitored.  Note: This version of the Python agent will no longer support Celery versions less than [v5.2.0](https://github.com/celery/celery/releases/tag/v5.2.0).

* Adds support for Graphene-Django

  * Add monitoring support for synchronous schemas created with [Graphene-Django](https://pypi.org/project/graphene-django/).  Previously, schemas created with Graphene-Django would only be partially monitored, resulting in missing [GraphQL](https://pypi.org/project/graphql-core/) related attributes.

* Adds support for middleware filtering in Django

  * Users are now able to filter which [Django](https://pypi.org/project/django/) middleware to monitor.  There are now [three additional settings](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#middleware-filters):
  
    * `instrumentation.middleware.django.enabled` (Default is `true`)
    * `instrumentation.middleware.django.exclude`
    * `instrumentation.middleware.django.include`
  
  See the [Django Middleware Filtering page](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/supported-features/django-middleware-filtering/) for more information and examples.

* Adds support for AWS Bedrock Converse API

  * Add monitoring support for non-streaming [Converse](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-runtime/client/converse.html) API.

## Bug fixes

* Add safeguard for deepest unique path in GraphQL

  * Some users were experiencing issues with the deepest unique path in [GraphQL](https://pypi.org/project/graphql-core/) not being generated due to a field name returning `None`. This issue has been fixed. 

* Add safeguard for web request parsing

  * Some users experienced a parsing error when `request_uri` was malformed or contained invalid characters.  This can happen at this point if the `request_uri` in the request header is invalid and does not match the (valid) URL originally given.  While this safeguard has now been put in place in New Relic, `urllib` has resolved this issue for versions of Python released after Jan 31, 2025.

* Fix crash in ElasticSearch and GraphQL when `trace.settings==None`

  * In cases where `trace.settings` is `None`, the instrumentation for ElasticSearch crashed the application.  A `global_settings` fallback has been put in place.  This also resolves the same issue found in GraphQL.

* Remove `options` method from async ElasticSearch client list

  * The previous instrumentation of ElasticSearch caused a crash because `options` was in the list of async methods.  This method does not need to be wrapped in a `DatastoreTrace` since it is not one that conducts any datastore operations/requests.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
