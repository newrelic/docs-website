## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds Agent Control health reporting, instrumentation for [cassandra-driver](https://pypi.org/project/cassandra-driver/), support for new a [langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) vectorstore, improves `NewRelicContextFormatter` stack traces logging, fixes compatibility issues with the [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/) `ProcessorFormatter`, and checks for `ExceptionMiddleware` removal in `starlette.exceptions`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add Agent Control health reporting

  * Adds agent health reporting capability to support the upcoming release of New Relic Fleet Control.

* Add support for cassandra-driver

  * Instrumentation support was added for [cassandra-driver](https://pypi.org/project/cassandra-driver/).

* Add support for new langchain vectorstore

  * Adds instrumentation for `TablestoreVectorStore` in [langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/).

* Enhance stack traces logged by `NewRelicContextFormatter`

  * The `NewRelicContextFormatter` now reports exception causes when logging stack traces. Thanks [@sweco](https://github.com/sweco) for your contribution!

## Bug fixes

* Fix compatibility issues with structlog's `ProcessorFormatter`

  *  Fix was added for the case where the [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/) `ProcessorFormatter` is used as a `logging.Formatter` for both logging and structlog log entries.

* Check for `ExceptionMiddleware` removal in `starlette.exceptions`

  * After [starlette](https://pypi.org/project/starlette/) v0.45.0 the import proxy for ExceptionMiddleware was removed from starlette.exceptions (and now only resides in starlette.middleware.exceptions).

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
