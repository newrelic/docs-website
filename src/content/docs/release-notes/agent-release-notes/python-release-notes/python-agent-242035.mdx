### Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes for issues with agent registration and use of proxies which could result in no data being reported.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug Fixes

* **Agent not recovering when errors occur during registration**

  If the agent initially registered with our data collector successfully, but subsequently failed to upload agent setting information due to a transient backend or network issue, the agent was not recovering from the error properly. The consequence of this was that the agent would not completely start up and no data would be collected or reported by that process. The operation of the web application as a whole would not have been affected. This issue, which was introduced in version 2.36.0.30 of the agent, is now fixed.
* **Agent not able to connect via some proxy servers**

  The Python agent was not able to connect to our data collector to register when certain proxy server installations or configurations were being used. We have updated the version of the internal HTTP client library used to resolve the issue.
* **Identification of Python web server being used**

  The Python agent was incorrectly reporting the Python web server being used as Tornado when both the 'gunicorn' and 'tornado' Python modules were being imported, even if the Tornado web server module wasn't actually being used. This did not affect the operation of the agent but could lead to confusion when trying to debug deployment issues.
