## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds the `record_log_event` API and includes some bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for redis v4.3.5 and v4.4.0 methods**

  New methods added in redis v4.3.5 and v4.4.0 will now be automatically instrumented.

* **Add record_log_event API**

  This records a [log event](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-python) that can be viewed and queried in the New Relic UI. See [record_log_event](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/recordlogevent-python-agent-api) for details.

## Bug fixes
* **Fix RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration**

  Properly guard `trace_cache` from `RuntimeErrors` raised due to concurrent iteration and size changes of the `TraceCache`.

* **Fix confluent-kafka producer arguments**

  Fixes a bug where topic provided as a keyword argument can crash Confluent Kafka producers.

* **Patch sentry SDK to correct ASGI v2/v3 detection**

  Patches sentry-sdk to fix a bug that causes incorrect ASGI application version detection with our wrapt function wrappers. To fix this, we now instrument the `_looks_like_asgi3()` function to bind out the wrapped app in sentry in order to unwrap it to be able to detect the proper ASGI version.

* **Fix missing information issue with Celery workers when using MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD**

  A bug was introduced in v7.8.0.174 when Celery was run with the `--loglevel=INFO` flag to not report any data after the original worker processes shut down. This has been fixed.

* **Fix support for dynamically generated types in Code Level Metrics**

  A bug in code level metrics attribute extraction prevented attributes from being applied to types created using the [3 argument type constructor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=type#type). This has been fixed.

* **Fix external node properties initialization**

  A bug caused by uninitialized external node properties when making web requests has been fixed. Thank you [@kmorey](https://github.com/kmorey) for your contribution!
