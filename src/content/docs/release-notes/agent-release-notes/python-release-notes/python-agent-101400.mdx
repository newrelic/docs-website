## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [Azure Function Apps](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions) and [protobuf](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf) v6.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Adds support for Azure Function Apps

  * Adds support for [Azure Function Apps](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions) for HTTPTrigger types.

## Bug fixes

* Adds pb2 files to enable protobuf v6 support

  * Previously, several google packages were not compatible with New Relic due to the lack of [protobuf](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf) v6 support.  This has now been resolved.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
