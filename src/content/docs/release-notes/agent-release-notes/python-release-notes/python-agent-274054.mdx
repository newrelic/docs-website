## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for reporting [datastore instance information](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-instance-level-database-information) for both the redis and MySQLdb drivers.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## New Features

* **Datastore instance information for redis**

  For redis operations made using the [redis-py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis) package, the Python agent will collect the host and port of the redis server, as well as the redis database index number. This data will be displayed in transaction traces and in slow query traces in APM.
* **Datastore instance information for MySQLdb**

  For queries made with the [MySQLdb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/) driver, the Python agent will collect the host and port of the database server, as well as the database name. This data will be displayed in transaction traces and in slow query traces in APM.
