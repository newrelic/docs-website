## Notes

This release of the Python agent updates the log file location in the default `newrelic.ini` file, and includes multiple bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic), or it can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Improved Features

* **Update log_file location in default `newrelic.ini`**

  The `newrelic.ini` generated using `newrelic-admin generate-config` has been updated to set the default `log_file` location to `stdout` for improved initial visibility. This setting can still be customized to log to `stderr` or a user-specified file as well.

## Bug Fixes

* **Handle `cherryPy.HTTPRedirects`**

  `cherrypy.HttpRedirects` were incorrectly being reported as errors. This has now been corrected thanks to a contribution from [@bdeeney](https://github.com/bdeeney)!

* ** Address `DeprecationWarning` for invalid escape sequence**

  A deprecation warning concerning unrecognized escape sequences in Python 3.6 (and higher) has been fixed. Thank you [@urianchang](https://github.com/urianchang) for your contribution!
