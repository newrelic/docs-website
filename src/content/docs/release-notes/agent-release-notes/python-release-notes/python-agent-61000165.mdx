## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds new instrumentation for the GraphQL frameworks Strawberry and Ariadne, updates to Graphene and Starlette GraphQL instrumentation, a change to logging configuration, and includes bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add new instrumentation for Strawberry**

  GraphQL applications built using Strawberry will now be automatically instrumented.

* **Add new instrumentation for Ariadne**

  GraphQL applications built using Ariadne will now be automatically instrumented.

## Improvements

* **Add new and changed metrics for Graphene applications**

  Metrics specifying the framework details for Graphene have been added, and GraphQL metrics now include Graphene as a product field.

  (eg. `GraphQL/operation/Graphene/query/<query_name>/<query_path>`)

* **Improve tracing in Starlette GraphQL applications**

  GraphQL applications using Starlette now support all executor classes. Previously, only async executor classes were supported.

## Changes

* **New Relic agent logs no longer propagate to the root logger by default**

  Previously, logs using the `logging` module sent to the `newrelic` logger would propagate to the root logger, potentially causing duplicate logs to appear or be sent to New Relic. This has been changed to no longer propagate to the root logger by default.

  To reverse this behavior, in your application you can run `logging.getLogger("newrelic").propagate = True` at any point after initializing the agent. If you use the `newrelic-admin` wrapper, this can be done at any time inside your application.

## Bug Fixes

* **TimeTrace.**str** recursion**

  A case of infinite recursion with `TimeTrace.__str__` has been corrected in this release. Calling `str()`, `repr()` or `print()` on a `TimeTrace` object or subclass instance will now display helpful debugging information about it.
