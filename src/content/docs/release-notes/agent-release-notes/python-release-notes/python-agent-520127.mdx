## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix for tornado and support for recording deployment markers in the EU region as well as specifying a deploy timestamp.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Support for Real Time Streaming**

  * Event data is now sent to New Relic every five seconds, instead of every minute. As a result, transaction, error, and custom events will now be available in New Relic and Insights dashboards in near real time. For more information on how to view your events with a five-second refresh, see the [real time streaming documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming).
  * Note that the overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute have not changed. Also, span events, metrics, and trace data is unaffected, and will still be sent every minute.
* **Added timestamp and EU region support for recording deployment markers**

  When using the newrelic-admin record-deploy script an optional timestamp can be provided to specify when the deployment marker should be created. Furthermore support for accounts in the EU region have been added in this release.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fixed a crash in tornado versions >= 6.1**

  Tornado 6.1 internals changed in a way that may have caused the agent's built-in instrumentation to fail. The instrumentation has been updated to alleviate this issue.
