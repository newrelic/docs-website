## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds a deprecation warning for customers that disable SSL, and adds bugfixes for supported async frameworks that use asyncio.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Mandatory SSL

* **Disabling SSL connections to New Relic has been deprecated**

  SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed.

## Bug Fixes

* **Using asyncio.gather or asyncio.ensure_future now tracks transaction context**

  Prior to this release, using asyncio.gather or asyncio.ensure_future may result in certain traces (such as external calls) not being reported in the transaction. Traces scheduled with asyncio.gather or asyncio.ensure_future from within the context of a transaction should now be properly attributed to the transaction.
