## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds improvements to django instrumentation, improvements to django rest framework instrumentation, and various bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Improved Features

* **Enabled reporting of handled exceptions in Django REST Framework**

  Exceptions handled by django rest framework are now reported if the resulting response code is not ignored (see [ignore_status_codes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#error-ignore-status-codes) for details).
* **Add support for the error_collector.ignore_status_codes setting in Django**

  Ignoring exceptions in Django was previously limited to the error_collector.ignore_errors configuration option. Ignoring exceptions by response status code is now supported for Django through the use of the error_collector.ignore_status_codes configuration option.

## Bug Fixes

* **Servicing aiohttp websocket requests results in an application crash**

  Servicing a websocket request in an aiohttp application may have resulted in an application crash when using the New Relic python agent. The application will now operate as expected when handling a websocket request.
* **Ignore incomplete aiohttp transactions**

  In aiohttp, connections can be terminated prior to the HTTP response being generated and sent. In those cases, the request handler may be cancelled. These transactions are no longer reported.
* **Fix HTTP status reporting for Tornado transactions**

  HTTP status was not properly added to Tornado transaction events and transaction traces. HTTP status is now automatically added to Tornado transaction events in Insights and transaction traces in APM.
* **Fix reporting of concurrent external requests in Tornado**

  External requests that execute in parallel in a tornado application may not have been recorded. This issue has been addressed.
