## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for async [PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/), [Motor](https://pypi.org/project/motor/), [aiomysql](https://pypi.org/project/aiomysql/), a new AWS account ID configuration setting, linking AWS entities for DynamoDB and Lambda, and fixes a path typing issue in `newrelic.initialize()`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add support for async PyMongo

  * Instrumentation support was added for asynchronous [PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/). Note that this API is currently in beta and may be subject to future breaking changes, which may affect instrumentation.

* Add support for Motor

  * Instrumentation support was added for [motor](https://pypi.org/project/motor/).

* Add support for aiomysql

  * Add support for [aiomysql](https://pypi.org/project/aiomysql/).

* Add new AWS account ID configuration setting

  * Some AWS instrumentations are not able to automatically determine the AWS account ID which is used to link the AWS entity in the service map. When `cloud.aws.account_id` is set, it will be used in certain AWS instrumentations such as DynamoDB to link the DynamoDB AWS entity in the service map. 
  
* Link AWS entity for DynamoDB

  * Add linking to the AWS entity in the service map for DynamoDB. This linking is done by utilizing the `cloud.aws.account_id` configuration setting.
  
* Link AWS entity for Lambda

  * Add linking to the AWS entity in the service map for Lambda. This linking is done by attaching the ARN to the lambda call's span.

## Bug fixes

* Fix path typing issue in `newrelic.initialize()`

  * Fixes a bug in `newrelic.initialize()` where pathlike objects were not accepted. This has been corrected to support strings, bytes, or [PathLike](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) objects.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
