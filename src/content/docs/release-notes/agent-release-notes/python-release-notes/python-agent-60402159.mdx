## Notes

This release of the Python agent updates Sanic instrumentation to support all available versions.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Improvements

* **Update Sanic instrumentation**

  The agent has updated support for all Sanic versions, with testing done on all versions >=18.12.0. Additionally, blueprint middleware is now supported.

* **Update Pyramid transaction naming**

  Previously, transaction names from exception views overrode route names. We've reversed this priority to be more in line with other instrumentation.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix inspect.formatargspec deprecation warning**

  A deprecation warning concerning `inspect.formatargspec` has been fixed.

* **Fix HTTPX crash**

  Initializing the agent after creating an HTTPX client could cause a crash in HTTPX. This has been corrected.
