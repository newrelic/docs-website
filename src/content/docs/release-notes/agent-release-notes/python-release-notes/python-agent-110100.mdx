## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for Claude model extractors with Claude Sonnet 3+, updates support for Bedrock's `invoke_model`, and adds a pre-release version of Windows compatibility.  Additionally, it provides fixes for early activation in Django instrumentation as well as server side overrides for max_samples_stored being ignored.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Adds support for Claude model extractors with Claude Sonnet 3+

  * Claude Sonnet 3+ is now supported with Claude model extractors.

* Updates support for Bedrock `invoke_model`

  * Updates Bedrock `invoke_model` model extractor logic to support models that are prefixed with a region.

* Adds Windows compatibility

  * Windows compatibility is now available as a pre-release feature.
    Note: Windows is not officially supported by the Python Agent yet.

## Bug fixes

* Prevents early activation in Django Instrumentation

  * Remove calls to `application_settings()` in Django instrumentation to prevent issues with early activations in pre-fork applications.

* Fix server configuration to local configuration sync issues

  * This fixes a bug created when `event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.*` settings were deprecated in favor of `*.max_samples_stored` settings. Some server side configurations were not overriding the client side configurations, resulting in data being sent to the collector despite the user disabling this.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.
