## Deprecations

* **Removed previously deprecated APIs**

  The following APIs have been removed:

  * transaction (use current_transaction)
  * name_transaction (use set_transaction_name)
  * Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric)
  * Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics)
  * Transaction.notice_error (use Transaction.record_exception)
  * Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric)
  * Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name)
* **Deprecate Transaction.add_user_attribute**

  Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release.
* **Deprecate Transaction.add_user_attributes**

  Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release.
* **Deprecate wrap_callable**

  wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release.
* **Remove data-source admin command**

  The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use [data sources](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-custom-metrics#registering-a-data-source) in place of the platform API.

## SSL

**SSL connections to New Relic are now mandatory**

Prior to this version, using an SSL connection to New Relic was the default behavior. SSL connections are now enforced (not overrideable).

## AIOHTTP Updates

* **Add automatic tracing of AIOHTTP 3 middleware**

  In addition to the old-style middleware previously supported, the AIOHTTP 3 style middleware is now automatically traced as part of the AIOHTTP instrumentation package.
