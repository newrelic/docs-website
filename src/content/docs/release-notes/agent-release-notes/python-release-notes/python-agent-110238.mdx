### Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes an issue when floating point values were used in headers used to calculate queueing time.

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* When a float value was provided in the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start headers as the time stamp, it was not being parsed correctly and the fractional part was being discarded. This was resulting in loss off accuracy.
