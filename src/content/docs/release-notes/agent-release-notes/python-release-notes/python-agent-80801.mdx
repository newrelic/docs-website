## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a bug in package reporting and adds support for redis 4.6.0 and loguru 0.7.0.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Enhancements

* **Add support for redis 4.6.0**
Adds instrumentation support for new `waitaof` method.

* **Add support for loguru 0.7.0**
Adds support for loguru v0.7.0.


## Bug fixes

* **Fix reporting of locally scoped packages**
Previously, locally scoped Python packages (such as those installed into user scope) were not reported on agent connect. This has been fixed.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.
