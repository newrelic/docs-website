## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds context data attributes to logs, support for dictionary type log messages, adds attribute support to `record_log_event` API, and obfuscates logged license keys and user API keys.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add context data attributes to logs**

  * Context data available from logging frameworks can now be recorded as attributes on logs. These attributes are prefixed with `context.`, which is not considered when filtering attributes from logs.
  * Context data may include extras, dictionary message attributes, and attributes provided by logging frameworks.
  * To report these attributes, [enable context data forwarding](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#application_logging.forwarding.context_data.enabled) and optionally configure [include](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#application_logging.forwarding.context_data.include) and [exclude](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#application_logging.forwarding.context_data.exclude) rules to filter the allowed attributes.

* **Add support for dictionary type log messages**

  * Dictionary type log messages are now supported for logging frameworks which support dictionary type log messages (including the builtin `logging` module and `structlog`).
  * The key `message` will be extracted if available and treated as the log message, and any other items will be considered context data attributes and prefixed with `message.`. These attributes are subject to the same filtering rules as other context data.

* **Add attribute support to `record_log_event` API**

  * The `record_log_event` API now allows passing context data in using the optional `attributes` keyword argument, and allows the message argument to be a dictionary as described above.

* **Obfuscate license keys and user API keys in logs**

  * The agent now obfuscates all instances of license keys or user API keys in agent logs and audit logs.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
