## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a bug in the `NewRelicContextFormatter` where attributes were dropped from logs.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug fixes

* **Fix log attribute dropping in `NewRelicContextFormatter`**
  * In v9.5.0, a bug in the `NewRelicContextFormatter` was introduced where `message` was added to the default set of keys to exclude. This caused extra attributes not in the default list to be dropped. This bug has been fixed.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
