## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds trace/span support for Hybrid Agent, New Relic's integration with OpenTelemetry. It also adds entity GUIDs to Agent Control health check files and adds `subcomponent` attributes to agentic AI instrumentation.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic), using `conda` via the [Conda-Forge Package Index](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/newrelic), or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* Add Hybrid Agent tracing support

  * Python users can now utilize OpenTelemetry-compatible sampling and tracing features. While the Metrics API is currently in development, this update lays the groundwork for full OpenTelemetry API integration, allowing for a gradual transition to vendor-agnostic instrumentation.
  * To enable this feature, either add `opentelemetry.enabled = true` to the configuration (*.ini or *.toml) file or set `NEW_RELIC_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED` as an environment variable to be `True`.
  * See [this page](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/supported-features/hybrid-agent/) for more information.

* Add `subcomponent` attributes to agentic AI instrumentation

  * Instrumentation for [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/), [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), and [Strands](https://pypi.org/project/strands-agents/) now includes a `subcomponent` attribute on spans that represent tool or agent calls. This is used to provide more enhanced entity mapping in the New Relic UI.

* Add entity GUID to Agent Control health check files

  * When the agent is started within an Agent Control environment, a health check file is created at the configured file location for every agent process. This file now includes the GUID of the entity related to the agent when available.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
