## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds trace/span support for Hybrid Agent, New Relic's integration with OpenTelemetry. It also adds entity GUIDs to Agent Control health check files and adds `subcomponent` attributes to agentic AI instrumentation.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic), using `conda` via the [Conda-Forge Package Index](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/newrelic), or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* Add Hybrid Agent tracing support

  * Hybrid Agent is designed to bridge the gap for teams looking to adopt OpenTelemetry standards while maintaining backwards compatibility with their existing New Relic dashboards. Hybrid Agent offers a "best-of-both-worlds" experience by combining New Relic’s deep visibility with OpenTelemetry API compatibility. It provides an observability solution with integrated support for the following OpenTelemetry APIs:
      * Tracing
      * Standalone library and native framework instrumentation
  * Key enhancements like Span Links and Events on Spans are now available, ensuring seamless interoperability in mixed-mode environments. 

* Introduces a new Trace Id Ratio based sampler
  
  * A new Trace Id Ratio based sampler. This sampling algorithm is based off the sampler of the same name from Open Telemetry, and can be configured to sample a set percentage of transactions.

* Add `subcomponent` attributes to agentic AI instrumentation

  * Instrumentation for [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/), [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), and [Strands](https://pypi.org/project/strands-agents/) now includes a `subcomponent` attribute on spans that represent tool or agent calls. This is used to provide more enhanced entity mapping in the New Relic UI.

* Add entity GUID to Agent Control health check files

  * When the agent is started within an Agent Control environment, a health check file is created at the configured file location for every agent process. This file now includes the GUID of the entity related to the agent when available.

## Bugs

* Fix duplicate hook finder instances

  * Previously it was possible for duplicates of the import hook finder to be found.  The import hook finder is now a singleton.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
