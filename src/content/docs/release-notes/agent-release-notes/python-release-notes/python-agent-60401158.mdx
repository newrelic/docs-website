## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [Flask v2](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0), improves logging for HTTP exceptions, and includes a bug fix.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add support for Flask v2**

  The agent will automatically instrument error handlers, nested blueprints, and async views.

## Improvements

* **Improved logging for 410 status codes**

  The agent now logs the content of a data collector response which specifies the reason for a disconnect for 410 status codes.

## Bug Fixes

* **Non-PID specific memory metric being reported**

  In agent version v6.2.0.156, memory metrics were modified to add the PID to each metric name. This release reintroduces non-PID specific memory metrics.
