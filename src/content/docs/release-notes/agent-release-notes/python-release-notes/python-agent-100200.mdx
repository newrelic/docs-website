## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds a flag for the Azure init container operator.
 
Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add Azure Init Container Operator Flag

  * New Relic can be integrated into applications hosted on Microsoft Azure, either [directly](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-azure-containerapps-appservice), through an [init container](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-azure-touchless-integration#integrate-agent-container-app) for [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview), or a [pre-build startup script](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-azure-touchless-integration#integrate-agent-app-service) for [Microsoft Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview). You can flag that this is the installation method used by setting the `NEW_RELIC_AZURE_OPERATOR_ENABLED` environment variable.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
