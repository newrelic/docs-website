## Notes

This release of the Python agent enables Distributed Tracing by default, deprecates Cross Application Tracing, and includes bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Cross Application is now deprecated, and disabled by default**

  Distributed tracing is replacing cross application tracing as the default means of tracing between services. To continue using it, enable it with `cross_application_tracer.enabled = True` and `distributed_tracing.enabled = False`

## Changes

* **Distributed tracing is enabled by default**

  The default setting for `distributed_tracing.enabled` is now True and the default setting for `cross_application_tracer.enabled` is now False.

* **New Relic logs no longer propagate to the root logger by default**

  Previously, logs using the `logging` module sent to the `newrelic` logger would propagate to the root logger, potentially causing duplicate logs to appear or be sent to New Relic. This has been changed to no longer propagate to the root logger by default. 
  
  To reverse this behavior, in your application at any point you can run `logging.getLogger("newrelic").propagate = False`

## Bug Fixes

* **TimeTrace.__str__ recursion**

  A case of infinite recursion with `TimeTrace.__str__` has been corrected in this release. Calling `str()`, `repr()` or `print()` on a `TimeTrace` object or subclass instance will now display helpful debugging information about it.
