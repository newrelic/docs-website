## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for async [elasticsearch](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch/), fixes a graphql configuration parsing issue, fixes a bug in the [Kombu](https://pypi.org/project/kombu/) instrumentation and re-enables the Kombu instrumentation.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add async support for elasticsearch

  * Adds support for async [elasticsearch](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch/). Thanks [fagnerzulin](https://github.com/fagnerzulin) for the contribution!

## Bug fixes

* Add parsing of graphql config setting 

  * Previously, when the setting `instrumentation.graphql.capture_introspection_queries` was set in the config file, this setting did not take effect. This has been fixed.

* Fix crash in Kombu when running with Sentry

  * Fixes a crash in [Kombu](https://pypi.org/project/kombu/) instrumentation where a `TypeError` was raised from the `inspect` module. This bug was due to a conflict in wrapping between New Relic and Sentry. The Kombu instrumentation has also been re-enabled.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old.
