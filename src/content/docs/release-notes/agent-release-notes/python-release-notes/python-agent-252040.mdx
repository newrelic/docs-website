### Notes

This release of the Python agent adds the ability to customize the hostname displayed in the APM UI, as well as updating the solrpy and pysolr instrumentation so that Solr metrics will now appear in the Databases tab in the UI.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Features

* Customize hostname displayed in APM

A new configuration setting has been added: [`process_host.display_name`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#process_host-display_name). When set in the `newrelic.ini` configuration file, the [display name will be used in the APM UI](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/add-rename-remove-hosts#display_name), in place of the hostname that the agent automatically captures. In addition, the display name can be set using the `NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME` environment variable.

### Features Changed

* Update solrpy and pysolr instrumention

Previously, solrpy and pysolr instrumentation reported metrics in the `Solr` namespace. Now, to align them with our recent changes to SQL and NoSQL instrumentation, solrpy and pysolr have been updated to report metrics in the `Datastore` namespace, which means that time spent in calls to Solr will be listed in both the main overview chart, as well as in the Databases tab in the UI.
