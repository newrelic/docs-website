## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds ARM64 wheels and fixes a crash in unsupported GraphQL versions.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add wheel support for ARM64 (a.k.a. AArch 64, ARMv8)**

  The agent now provides prebuilt wheels for ARM64 for Python versions >=3.6. This requires a version of pip>=19.3.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix a crash in unsupported GraphQL versions**

  A crash in GraphQL could occur when using an older version not supported by our instrumentation (ie. `graphql-core<2.1`). This has been corrected.
