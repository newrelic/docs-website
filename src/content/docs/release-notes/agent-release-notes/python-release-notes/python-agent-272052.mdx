### Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for reporting [datastore instance information](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues) for the `psycopg2` Postgresql driver.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

### New Feature

* **Datastore instance information for psycopg2**

  For queries made with the `psycopg2` Postgresql driver, the Python agent will collect the host and port of the database server, as well as the database name. This data will be displayed in transaction traces and in slow query traces in APM.
