### Notes

This release of the Python agent reports error events to Insights and captures enhanced error data to support the new Advanced Error Analytics feature in APM.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Feature

* Error Events

The Python agent now sends [TransactionError](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/error-event-default-attributes-insights) events for [Advanced Error Analytics](https://blog.newrelic.com/2015/11/12/apm-error-analytics/), which power the new APM Errors functionality (currently in Beta). This allows users to create charts that facet and filter their error data by attributes, as well as explore their error events in Insights. For details, see the [APM Errors documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-errors-error-traces).

### Changed Feature

* Additional Attributes collected

The agent now collects [additional attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/attributes/python-agent-attributes#attributes) for web transactions:

* HTTP request headers: `Host` and `Accept`
* HTTP response header :`Content-Length`

### Bug Fix

* Improved unicode support for exception messages

Unicode exception messages will still be preserved, even if `sys.setdefaultencoding()` has been called to change the default encoding.
