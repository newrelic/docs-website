## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes improvements to our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications as well as bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## New Feature

* **Tornado 4 Outbound Cross Application Tracing**

  Tornado 4 [Cross Application Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing) is now supported for outbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, Tornado 4 transaction traces will now contain links to the application it called. With this update, Cross Application Tracing is now fully supported for Tornado 4 applications.

## Bug Fixes

* **Django 1.10+ browser monitoring with new-style gzip middleware**

  Browser monitoring was not automatically inserted when using new style Django 1.10+ gzip middleware. Browser monitoring code is now inserted as expected.
* **Using motor versions 1.X generated instrumentation errors**

  Motor 1.0 removed the MotorReplicaSetClient class which resulted in the New Relic Python Agent generating an instrumentation error when attempting to access that class. The instrumentation has been fixed.
