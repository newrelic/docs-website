## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for Kombu, mysqlclient, PyMySQL, and adds a few safeguards to prevent exceptions.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add support for Kombu

  * Add support for producer and consumer message tracing in [Kombu](https://pypi.org/project/kombu/).
  * In the case where Celery and Kombu are used together, a transaction is produced for both Celery and Kombu message consumption and Kombu consumer tracing is turned off by default. It can be enabled via the `instrumentation.kombu.consumer.enabled` setting. A new setting `instrumentation.kombu.ignored_exchanges` to ignore certain exchanges was also added and by default it ignores the celeryev queue which is a monitoring queue.

* Add support for mysqlclient (a MySQLdb fork for Python 3)

  * Instrumentation for the Python 2 library [MySQLdb](https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/) has been adapted to support the Python 3 fork [mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/).

* Update instrumentation for PyMySQL for versions 1.0.3 and above

  * Instrumentation for [PyMySQL](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/) has been updated for newer versions of the library, and versions below 1.0.3 are no longer supported.

## Bug fixes

* Safeguard startup of agent healthchecks against exceptions

  * Previously, the agent healthchecks could raise exceptions during startup, potentially resulting in agent crashes. This has been fixed.

* Fix warning message around garbage collection runtime metrics sampler

  * Previously, a warning message was sometimes emitted which was related to the garbage collection runtime metrics sampler. This has been fixed.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
