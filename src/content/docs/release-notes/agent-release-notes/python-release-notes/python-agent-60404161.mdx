## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds wildcarding to instrumentation config and fixes a crash in the memory metric sampler.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Improvements

* **Add wildcard matching to instrumentation via config file**

  The agent now supports wildcards for classes and functions when instrumenting via config file. **Note: this does not include module paths.**

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix a crash in memory sampling on BSD kernels**

  A crash in the memory metric sampler was possible when using kernels besides MacOS and Linux. This has been corrected.
