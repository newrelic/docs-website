## Improvements

* **Added wildcard matching to instrumentation via config file**

  The agent now supports wildcards for classes and functions when instrumenting via config file. **Note: this does not include module paths.**

## Bug Fixes

* **Fixed a crash in memory sampling on BSD kernels**

  A crash in the memory metric sampler was possible when using kernels besides MacOS and Linux. This has been corrected.
