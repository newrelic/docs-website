### Notes

This release of the Python agent enables the collection of transaction traces for Synthetics requests by default, and adds the individual trip trace visualization for Cross Application Tracing.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Features

* **Cross Application Tracing for individual transactions**

  Version 2.38.0.31 of the Python agent introduced aggregated transaction maps. In this release, we have built on that feature to add the ability to view an end-to-end visualization of an individual transaction, in order to better understand what backend applications and external services were called during the course of a single transaction.

### Features Changed

* **Synthetics support enabled by default**

  When the Python agent added support for the [collection of transaction traces for Synthetics requests](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collecting-synthetic-transaction-traces) in version 2.32.0.28, the feature had to be explicitly enabled in the agent configuration file. With this release, support for Synthetics is enabled by default.

### Bug Fixes

* **Non ASCII characters in transaction names**

  If a transaction name contained a Unicode character outside of the ASCII range, the generation of the cross application tracing attributes would result in a UnicodeEncodeError. This bug affected versions 2.38.0.31 through 2.38.2.33. The issue is fixed in the current release.
* **Parsing SQL statements referencing the database schema**

  Previously, SQL statements that referenced a table from a database schema namespace, such as “schema.table_name”, would not always be parsed correctly, resulting in the table being identified as just “schema”. The agent now handles this case correctly, and the table is reported as “schema.table_name”.
* **Additional support for Tornado 1.X**

  If Tornado 1.X was being used, the instrumentation would fail at run time causing all web requests to fail. Monitoring of Tornado 1.X applications should now work correctly.
