## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for Python 3.13, adds a new Large Language Model (LLM) API, supports Docker ID parsing in Amazon ECS Fargate environments, and instruments a new Langchain vectorstore.


Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).


## New features

* Add support for Python 3.13

  * The agent now supports applications running in Python 3.13.

* Add new LLM custom attribute context manager API

  * The agent now includes a new context manager API that adds custom attributes to LLM events generated from calls to LLMs in application code. For more information on usage, please see our [API documentation](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/withllmcustomattributes-python-agent-api).

* Add support for reporting of [Amazon ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) Docker IDs

  * The agent now reports Docker IDs for containers running in ECS Fargate environments.

* Add instrumentation for `SQLiteVec` vectorstore in Langchain

  * The agent now instruments `similarity_search` for the `SQLiteVec` vectorstore.


## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
