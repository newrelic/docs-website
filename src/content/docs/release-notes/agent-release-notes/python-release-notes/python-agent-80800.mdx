## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for two new errors inbox features: error fingerprinting and user tracking.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **New Errors Inbox features**

**User tracking**: You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group. Identify the end user with the set_user_id method.

**Error fingerprinting**: Are your error occurrences grouped poorly? Set your own error fingerprint via a callback function.

## Bug fixes

* **Guard GraphQL settings lookup**
In v8.7.1, a bug was introduced in GraphQL instrumentation when not running within a transaction. This crash has been addressed.

* **Fix Redis instance information**
Redis v4.5.2 included a change that broke detection for socket based redis instance information. The agent now correctly detects socket paths again.


## Support statement

As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.12.0.140](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-5120140/).
