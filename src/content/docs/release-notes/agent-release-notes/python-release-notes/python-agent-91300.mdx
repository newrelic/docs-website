## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds the following:

* Support for boto3's `upload_file` command
* Support for newly added Redis commands
* AWS SQS information on spans
* `server.address` attribute on RabbitMQ

This release also fixes an issue with OpenAI's client instrumentation and missing parameters in Botocore SQS.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add instrumentation for `upload_file` in boto3

  * Add instrumentation to the [s3transfer](https://pypi.org/project/s3transfer/) `BoundExecutor` submit function, allowing the agent to support the `upload_file` operation in [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/).

* Add support for new Redis commands

  * Add instrumentation for the following commands in [Redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/):
    * hexpire
    * hexpireat
    * hexpiretime
    * hpersist
    * hpexpire
    * hpexpireat
    * hpexpiretime
    * hpttl
    * httl

* Capture AWS SQS information on message spans:

  * The Python Agent now captures the following AWS SQS information on message spans, allowing the UI to link AWS information with AWS SQS:
    * `messaging.system` - aws_sqs
    * `cloud.region` - AWS region
    * `cloud.account.id` - AWS account ID
    * `messaging.destination.name` - AWS queue name

* Add `server.address` attribute to RabbitMQ:

  * Add `server.address` attribute to [RabbitMQ](https://pypi.org/project/rabbitmq/), allowing the UI to link AWS information with AWS MQ.

## Bug fixes

* Fix TypeError in OpenAI instrumentation:

  * Newer versions of [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) include an additional argument, resulting in an error with the base client instrumentation.  This has been fixed.

* Fix missing parameters in `MessageTrace`:

  * Resolved issue where parameters were not being passed from the `MessageTraceWrapper` to the `MessageTrace`.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
