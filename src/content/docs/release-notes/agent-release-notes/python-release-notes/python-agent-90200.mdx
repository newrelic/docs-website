## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds a new configuration option that allows users to disable capturing package and version information at agent startup.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add new configuration option `package_reporting.enabled`.**
  This option allows users to disable capturing package and version information at agent startup. On some applications with a high number of packages some users were seeing a spike in CPU usage. Disabling this setting provides a workaround for that issue.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
