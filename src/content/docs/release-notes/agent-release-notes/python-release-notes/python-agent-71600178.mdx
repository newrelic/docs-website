## Notes

This release of the Python agent enables log forwarding to New Relic by default. It also addresses a bug related to compressed bytes calculations and adds a new top level data usage supportability metric to the agent.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add APM logs in context**

    Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about about this feature, see the [APM logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context/). For additional configuration options, see the [Python logs in context documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-python/). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account, see our documentation to [disable automatic logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging) via the UI or API.

* **Add top level aggregated data usage supportability metric**

    The agent now reports a top level data usage supportability metric: `Supportability/Python/Collector/Output/Bytes`. This aggregates all uncompressed bytes across all agent methods sent to New Relic.

## Changes

* **Change data usage supportability metric name**

    Previously, the agent reported data usage supportability metrics in the format `Supportability/Python/Collector/Output/Bytes/<agent_method>`. This has been changed to be in the format `Supportability/Python/Collector/<agent_method>/Output/Bytes` to align with the agent specification.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix data usage supportability metric compression payload calculation**

    Previously, the agent was reporting the compressed bytes for the `Supportability/Python/Collector/Output/Bytes` metric group and uncompressed bytes for the `Supportability/Python/Collector/ZLIB/Bytes` metric group. This was incorrect and has been fixed in this release.

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.0.0.124](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-500124/).
