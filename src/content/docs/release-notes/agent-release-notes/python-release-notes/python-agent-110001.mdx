## Notes

This release of the Python agent provides fixes for early activation in [Django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/) instrumentation, server side overrides for `max_samples_stored` being ignored, and guards against crashes from `trace_cache.pop()`.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug fixes

* Prevents early activation in Django instrumentation

  * Remove calls to `application_settings()` in [Django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/) instrumentation to prevent issues with early activations in pre-fork applications.

* Fix server configuration to local configuration sync issues

  * This fixes a bug created when `event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.*` settings were deprecated in favor of `*.max_samples_stored` settings. Some server side configurations were not overriding the client side configurations, resulting in data being sent to the collector despite the user disabling this.

* Guard against crashes from `trace_cache.pop()`

  * In the `ContextOf` class, there was an unsafe access of the `trace_cache` via `pop(key)` without a default value. This caused crashes when the `weakref` in the dictionary was already garbage collected.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.
