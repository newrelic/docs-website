## Notes

This release of the Python agent introduces manylinux wheels and includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug fixes

* **Data was erroneously discarded when an HTTP protocol error occurred**

  When an unexpected HTTP error occurred (such as a timeout), data was erroneously discarded. Data is now downsampled and retransmitted when an HTTP protocol error occurs.

* **Error when installing with an incompatible setuptools_scm version**

  The version requirements were not correctly set for the setuptools_scm build time requirement, which may have resulted in an error at installation. The version requirements for setuptools_scm are now set appropriately.
