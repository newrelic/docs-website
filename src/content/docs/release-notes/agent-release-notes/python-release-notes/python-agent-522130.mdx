## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix thread utilization data on agent versions v5.x.x**

  Thread utilization data was not reported for agents v5.x.x, resulting in missing data on the capacity analysis page. The agent will now report thread utilization data.
* **Fix untraced database calls when using pymysql context manager assignments**

  When using context managers to create and assign a cursor in pymysql, database calls on that cursor object were not traced. Database calls in pymysql are now properly traced.
