## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a memory leak that occurs on Python 2 when monitoring WSGI applications.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix memory leak on Python 2 WSGI applications**

  When using the 4.16.0 agent on Python 2 to monitor WSGI applications, the agent would cause memory to be allocated on each request. On Python 2, this memory was never deallocated due to a reference cycle. This has now been corrected.
