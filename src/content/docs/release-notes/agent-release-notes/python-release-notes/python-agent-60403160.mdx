## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix related to middleware and background tasks in Starlette/ FastAPI.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix Starlette/ FastAPI transaction naming and classification**

  Starlette/ FastAPI routes that contained middleware and background tasks were being incorrectly classified as non-web transactions and named after the background task rather than the route. This has been corrected in this release.
