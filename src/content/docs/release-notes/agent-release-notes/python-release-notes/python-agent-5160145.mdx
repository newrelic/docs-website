## Notes

This release of the Python agent changes the internal http client from requests to urllib3, updates logging, and includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Improved Features

* **The NewRelicContextFormatter now records extras**

  When using the `NewRelicContextFormatter` log formatter, extras are now automatically captured and recorded in the New Relic agent logs product.
* **The agent now internally uses urllib3**

  The python agent previously used requests as its http client. The agent now uses urllib3 internally for HTTP communication with New Relic data ingest services.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix gRPC application crash when credentials are supplied**

  When using the credentials argument, the agent's built in gRPC instrumentation caused an application crash. This crash has been fixed.

* **Fix Tornado framework crashes when finish is called from a different task**

  When finish is called from a different task, applications using the Tornado framework may crash. This crash has been fixed.
