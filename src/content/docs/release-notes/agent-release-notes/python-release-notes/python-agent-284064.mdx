## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes and improvements to the precision of the duration data recorded for transaction traces.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## Improved Feature

* **Transaction trace precision**

  This release improves the precision of transaction traces. Duration of functions in a transaction trace are now recorded at sub-millisecond precision.

## Bug Fixes

* **Custom classmethod traces may incorrectly return the parent class**

  Wrapping classmethods in classes that are subclassed could cause the subclassed classmethod to be improperly bound to the parent class. This would result in the classmethod returning an instance of the parent class when the method was called on a child class.
* **Handle incomplete Tornado coroutine traces**

  Tracing a Tornado coroutine that never completed and was later garbage collected, could result in an application hang. This has been fixed.
