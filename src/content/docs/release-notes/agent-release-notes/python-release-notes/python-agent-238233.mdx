### Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a memory leak which affects our Tornado instrumentation, and which was a factor in the recent issues we had with the Django template instrumentation.

The agent can be installed using **easy_install/pip/distribute** via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see [Status of the Python agent](/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug Fixes

* Due to an issue with the low level function wrappers we use to instrument third party Python modules, memory was being leaked and process memory usage could increase over time. This issue affects version 2.32.0 through 2.38.0 of the Python agent and has been impacting on our Tornado instrumentation.

  The memory leak has also been identified as the root cause for memory leaks in our Django template instrumentation, affecting versions 2.32.0.28 through 2.36.0.30. The Django template instrumentation was disabled in the prior 2.38.0.31 release while we investigated the cause. It remains disabled by default.
