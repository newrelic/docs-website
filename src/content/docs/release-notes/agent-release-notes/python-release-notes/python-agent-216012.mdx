### Notes

This release of the Python agent adds obfuscation of explain plans as the default when using PostgreSQL, as well as including bug fixes related to the instrumentation for some MySQL database client modules.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* Fixes an agent bug with PostgreSQL where parameters from the original query could appear in explain plans sent to New Relic servers, even when SQL obfuscation was enabled. Parameters from the query are now masked in explain plans prior to transmission when transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to 'obfuscated' (the default setting).
* The automatic rollback or commit performed on exit of the context manager for a database connection was not being monitored and reported when using the MySQLdb, pymysql and oursql database client modules for the MySQL database.
