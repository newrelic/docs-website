### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem introduced in our last release (v2.72.0.52) where users of the `psycopg2` Postgresql database adapter could see extra Datastore entries in the Breakdown Table on the Transactions page in APM.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

### Bug Fix

* **Remove extra Datastore segments from the Transactions Breakdown Table**

  Due to the extra Datastore segments in the Breakdown Table on the Transactions page in APM, the "% Time" column would add up to greater than 100%. This problem has now been fixed. Users of `psycopg2` who are using v2.72.0.52 of the Python agent are encouraged to upgrade to this latest version.
