## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [oracledb](https://pypi.org/project/oracledb/), fixes a bug in Kombu and Kafka where `MessageTransaction` object has no attribute `destination_name`, and fixes the disappearance of utilization metadata with AWS.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Adds support for oracledb

  * Add instrumentation for [oracledb](https://pypi.org/project/oracledb/).

## Bug fixes

* Fix "`MessageTransaction` object has no attribute `destination_name`" bug 

  * Fix a bug in MessageBroker instrumentations where the serialize methods were looking for the `destination_name` attribute on the `MessageTransaction` and it did not exist.

* Fix AWS utilization metadata issue when running AWS and K8s together

  * Due to permissions settings in K8s pods running on AWS EC2 instances, the utilization metadata is able to be retrieved the first time. However, if the application is left running continuously, the agent will reconnect and the utilization metadata fails to load. In cases like these, the utilization metadata is cached per agent instance and is able to be retrieved.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.
