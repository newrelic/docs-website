### Notes:

This release of the Python agent is a minor feature and bug fix release.

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New features:

* When reporting web application performance data against multiple applications in the New Relic UI at the same time, any end user metric data will now also be reported against all applications. Previously end user metric data would only be reported against the first application.
* The environment variable 'NEW_RELIC_SSL' can now be set to enable use of a SSL connection when reporting data to our data collector. Enabling values are 'true', 'on' or '1'. This can be used on platforms such as Heroku where configuration is performed using environment variables instead of an agent configuration file.
* Added instrumentation for tracking database queries when using the 'pymysql' module for the MySQL database.

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* Fix to algorithm calculating name of function for case where function was wrapped with a decorator implemented using a class. Previously was using the name of the decorator class rather than the name of the wrapped function.
* Fix for ZeroDivision error when calculating per request CPU burn, where due to clock granularity for system the request was quick enough to effectively have zero duration.
* Fix for AttributeError when trying to process None as a slow transaction trace when in a harvest period there were browser traces but no application server traces.
