## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/) and some bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Enhancements

* **Add support for structlog**
  Adds instrumentation support for [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/).

## Bug fixes

* **Fix certificate fallback logic**
  Fixed the fallback logic for the certificate bundle such that it only uses the builtin bundle when both the cafile AND capath are None.

* **Fix missing database metric**
  Fixed an issue where certain databases were not recording the `Datastore/instance/<db>/<host>/<port>` metric and so the database was not showing up in the service map.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
