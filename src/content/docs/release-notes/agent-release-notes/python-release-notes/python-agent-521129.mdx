## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix a crash when using future-based interfaces on Tornado's http client**

  Tornado's http client returns a future when fetch is called. Prior to this release, the agent caused a coroutine object to be returned rather than a future, causing a potential crash when application code assumed a future would be returned. A future will now be returned from http client fetch as expected.
* **Fix a crash when running a coroutine created in another transaction**

  When running a coroutine outside of the transaction that created it, the agent may have crashed if a separate transaction was active.
