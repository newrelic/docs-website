## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes and improvements to the builtin pika instrumentation.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## Improved Feature

* **Naming of Pika Message Transactions**

  This release improves the naming of message transactions . Message consumer transactions are now split based on the name of the consume callback.
* **Improved metadata collection for cloud providers**

  The agent now collects additional metadata when running in AWS, GCP, Azure, and PCF. This information is used to provide an enhanced experience when the agent is deployed on those platforms.

## Bug Fixes

* **CherryPy WSGI Server automatic instrumentation**

  This release fixes a bug where `cherrypy.wsgiserver.CherryPyWSGIServer` was not being instrumented. This bugfix impacts CherryPy versions v6.1.0 to v8.9.1.
