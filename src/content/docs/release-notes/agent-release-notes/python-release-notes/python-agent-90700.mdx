## Notes

This release of the Python agent no longer reports attributes with `None` values. It also attaches a transaction trace ID to the error traces even when distributed tracing is disabled.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Remove reporting of attributes with `None` values**

  * Previously, the agent recorded attributes with a value of `None` type as the string "None".  The agent will no longer record user or agent attributes that have `None` type values.

## Bug fixes

* **Add transaction trace ID to the error traces even when distributed tracing is disabled**
  * Previously, certain trace attributes in error traces such as stack traces were only visible in the UI if distributed tracing was enabled.  Linking the transaction trace to error traces by including the transaction trace ID on the error traces allows the user to have access to the transaction trace attributes in the UI.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
