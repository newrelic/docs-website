## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds instrumentation for [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/), removes support for Python 3.5, and includes performance enhancements.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Removed support for Python 3.5**

  Python 3.5 is no longer supported by the agent. Please consider upgrading your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python Agent.

## New Features

* **Added httpx instrumentation**

  External web service requests made with the httpx client module will now be automatically instrumented.
* **Added Django ASGI instrumentation**

  Django's ASGI mode will now be supported through automatic instrumentation.

## Improved Features

* **Improved startup performance**

  The loading of urllib3 is now delayed and happens on a background thread which improves overall initialization time.

## Bug Fixes

* **Non-ASCII HTTP referers crash fix**

  Crashes had occurred when non-ASCII HTTP referers were passed to ASGI applications. This crash no longer occurs as of this release.
