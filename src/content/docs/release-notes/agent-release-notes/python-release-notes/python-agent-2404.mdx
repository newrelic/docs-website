### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a bug fix release primarily to address a number of issues introduced in version 2.2.0.2 which have effected a small number of users.

This version of the agent is also the minimum recommended agent version required to be able to see percentiles and histogram charts. All reporting hosts for an application must be upgraded to the minimum agent version for the feature to be visible.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directory from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the [status of the Python agent](https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes/Improvements:

* Fixed issues with instrumentation wrappers which caused failure of WSGI application integration for FASTCGI/SCGI/AJP using flup.
* Fixed issues with instrumentation wrappers which caused failure of wrappers for external web service calls in certain uses cases.
* Fixes issues with instrumentation wrappers which caused failure when queuing Celery tasks from within a web application using django-celery.
* When using the ErrorTrace context manager to capture details of exceptions within a certain context, None can now be passed for the transaction and an assertion failure will not be raised. This avoids the need to check explicitly to see if a web request is being monitored and avoid using ErrorTrace where there isn't.
