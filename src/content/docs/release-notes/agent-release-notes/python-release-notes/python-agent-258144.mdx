### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem where the package failed to install under certain circumstances.

### Bug Fix

The `README.rst` file contained non-ASCII characters, which could result in a `UnicodeDecodeError` during installation. Those characters have been removed.
