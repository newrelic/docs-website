## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds Python 3.11 support, deprecates the add_custom_parameter(s) API, adds usage metrics for multiple libraries, and includes bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **add_custom_parameter(s) API is now deprecated**
  The add_custom_parameter(s) API has been renamed to add_custom_attribute(s). A deprecation warning will be emitted when calling add_custom_parameter() from this agent version and higher.

## New features

* **Add support for Python 3.11**
    The agent now supports applications running in Python 3.11.

* **Add usage metrics for Kafka clients, Daphne, and Hypercorn**
  The agent now emits a messagebroker metric for Kafka clients and a dispatcher metric for Daphne and Hypercorn. This metric is similar to the framework metric already being emitted for all web frameworks supported by the agent.


## Bug fixes
* **Fix Flask view support for Code Level Metrics**
    The agent was previously reporting the class name for the code.function attribute in the case of Flask method dispatching. This has been corrected to report the instrumented function name.

* **Fix aioredis version crash**
    A fix has been implemented to address a crash in aioredis in cases where the agent was initialized before importing aioredis on aioredis>=2.0.1.

## Support statement
  New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.2.2.130](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-522130).
