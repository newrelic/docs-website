## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix for reporting inaccurate metric values.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug Fixes

* **Metrics may be reported with an incorrect throughput after communication failure with New Relic**

  For agent versions 5.2.0 through 5.4.0, metric throughput may have been reported inaccurately after experiencing network / communication failures with New Relic. The throughput reported for all metrics after this failure may have been abnormally high.
