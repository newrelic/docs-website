### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to prevent proxy credentials set in the agent configuration file from being transmitted to New Relic.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see [Status of the Python agent](/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug fixes

* Previously, the agent stripped the `proxy_user` and `proxy_pass` settings when it transmitted configuration settings to New Relic, so as not to expose credentials. However, the `proxy_host` setting was transmitted unaltered, even if it was a URI containing a username and/or password. With this release, proxy usernames and passwords specified in a URI in the `proxy_host` setting are obfuscated before being transmitted. In addition, the `proxy_user` and `proxy_pass` settings are obfuscated, and are also transmitted.
