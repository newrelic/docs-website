### Notes

This release of the Python agent provides improvements to how we report agent configuration information. This enables us to better help you debug any issues you may experience with configuring the agent.

The agent can be installed using **easy_install/pip/distribute** via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent see [Status of the Python agent](/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Features

* **Configuration Information**

  Agent configuration information displayed in the New Relic UI will now reflect the final configuration used by the agent for an application. This includes the result of any server side configuration settings, which are applied on top of the agent defaults, agent configuration file or environment variables. Previously, the result of applying the server side configuration settings was not being displayed.

### Bug Fixes

* If running a system with a Linux 3.X kernel, the agent could fail when attempting to register with our data collector. No data would subsequently be collected or reported. This would occur for versions of Python 2 prior to Python 2.7.3 and versions of Python 3 prior to Python 3.3, if they were built on a system with a Linux 3.X kernel.
