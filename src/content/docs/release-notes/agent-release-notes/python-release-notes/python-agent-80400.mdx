<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.2.2.130](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-522130).

## Notes

This release of the Python agent increases the custom event limit and includes a bug fix.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Changes

* **Increase custom event limit**

  This agent version increases the default limit of custom events from 1,200 events per minute to 3,600 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable maximum limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, see the [docs for event_harvest](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/#harvest-limits-custom-event-data). To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/send-more-custom-events-with-the-latest-apm-agents/190497).

## Bug fixes

* **Fix NewRelicContextFormatter attribute error**

  A bug was introduced in v8.3.0 that caused an AttributeError when using the NewRelicContextFormatter. This has been corrected in this release version.
