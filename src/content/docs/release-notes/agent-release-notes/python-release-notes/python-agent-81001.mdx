## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes an issue with MetricNormalizationRules, fixes a DeprecationWarning in package version detection, and adds support for new commands introduced in [Redis v5](https://pypi.org/project/redis/).

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Enhancements

* **Add support for new commands introduced in Redis v5**
  Adds full instrumentation support for [Redis v5](https://pypi.org/project/redis/).

## Bug fixes

* **Fix crash in MetricNormalizationRules**
  Fixed a crash when using client side MetricNormalizationRules to ignore metrics (set through NerdGraph and available under a feature flag). The metrics should now be properly ignored.

* **Fix DeprecationWarning in package version detection for Python 3.10+**
  Fixed a DeprecationWarning emitted by package version detection used internally for Python 3.10+. When importlib.metadata is available, prefer using it to avoid checking deprecated **version** attributes on modules. (Thanks @renanivo for the contribution!)

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
