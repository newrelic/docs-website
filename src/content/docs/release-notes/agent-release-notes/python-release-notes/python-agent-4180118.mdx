## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds improvements to the gRPC instrumentation package and includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Improved gRPC support**

  Support for measuring inbound gRPC requests has now been added. Inbound gRPC requests will now show as web transactions in APM. Additionally, distributed tracing is now supported as part of the gRPC instrumentation package.

## Bug Fixes

* **Update pika instrumentation to support the 1.x releases**

  When using the agent with pika versions 1.x and up, the agent may have caused an application crash. The agent now correctly collects data on newer versions of pika.
* **The startup_timeout setting may not have been honored in a multithreaded application**

  When startup_timeout is set to a number greater than 0, the servicing of transactions is blocked until the agent has fully activated. In multithreaded applications, only the first thread would block due to improper locking. The agent will now block on all threads.
