## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds Python 3.12 support. It also includes support for sending utilization data for Docker with cgroups v2, adds a new synthetics information header, upgrades the agent's internal [wrapt](https://pypi.org/project/wrapt/1.16.0/) version, and includes a bug fix for [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/).

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for Python 3.12**
  The agent now supports applications running in Python 3.12.

* **Add support for Docker cgroups v2**
  The agent now includes functionality to parse Docker IDs in later versions of Docker using cgroups v2.

* **Add new synthetics information header**
  The agent now retransmits and processes information contained in a new synthetics header: X-NewRelic-Synthetics-Info.

## Changes

* **Upgrade internal wrapt to v1.16.0**
  The agent's internal copy of [wrapt](https://pypi.org/project/wrapt/1.16.0/) has been upgraded to v1.16.0 in conjunction with Python 3.12 support.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix structlog CallsiteParameter processor bug**
  Call site parameter values in [structlog](https://pypi.org/project/structlog/) no longer produce incorrect values.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
