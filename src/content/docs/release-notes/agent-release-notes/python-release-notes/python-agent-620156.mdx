## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes new garbage collection runtime metrics as well as improved metrics for CPU and memory usage. This release also includes bug fixes for Uvicorn instrumentation and FIPS compliant systems.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Adds garbage collection runtime metrics.**

  Records statistics as metrics after garbage collection sweeps. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled and configured with [these settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration).

## Improved Features

* **Improved CPU metric sampling.**

  Adds separate metrics for user time, system time, and total time as well as utilization as a percentage for each.

* **Improved memory metric sampling.**

  Adds memory utilization as a percentage, and adds PID to metrics to allow faceting in NRQL queries.

* **Increased custom attribute limit from 64 to 128.**

  The custom attribute limit affects user added attributes on spans, events, and transactions.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a TypeError with Uvicorn and unix sockets.

* Fixed a crash when using a FIPS compliant system with Cross Agent Tracing enabled.
