## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [Redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) v6.0.0 and fixes conflicts with the [opentelemetry-proto](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-proto/) package.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add support for Redis v6.0.0

  * Adds support for all client methods introduced in [Redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) v6.0.0.

## Bug fixes

* Fix conflicts with opentelemetry-proto package

  * Fixes an issue where the agent's internal copy of [opentelemetry-proto](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-proto/) would conflict with any other packages relying on opentelemetry-proto (such as ChromaDB). This should now be treated as a separate package by OpenTelemetry and prevent any conflicts.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
