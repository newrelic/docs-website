## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for Falcon framework, and includes various bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Add support for Falcon web framework**

  This release adds support for the Falcon web framework. Data will now be automatically collected for applications using Falcon framework. The data will appear in both APM and Insights and will include performance details as well as information on application errors.

## Bug Fixes

* **"newrelic-admin record_deploy" now functions with proxies.**

  The `newrelic-admin` record_deploy command previously did not function when a proxy was defined by the newrelic.ini configuration file or the \`NEW_RELIC_PROXY_\*\` environment variables. This bug has now been fixed.
* **Cross Application Tracing HTTP response headers were inserted on a 304 response**

  When cross application tracing is enabled and the agent received a HTTP request from an application utilizing cross application tracing, the agent may have inserted additional response headers on a 304 HTTP response. The agent will no longer insert headers on a 304 response.
