## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds instrumentation for [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Python 3.5 has been deprecated**

  Python 3.5 has reached [end of life](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/#release-schedule) and support will be dropped in a future release. Using the agent with Python 3.5 will generate a deprecation warning. Updating Python versions is recommended.

## New Features

* **Adds Starlette framework instrumentation**

  Starlette applications will now be automatically instrumented. Transaction data will be collected and recorded for application routes, background tasks, exception handlers, and installed middleware. Exception logging has also been added.
* **Adds FastAPI framework instrumentation**

  FASTAPI applications will also now be automatically instrumented. See above for instrumentation details.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix deprecation warning for find_loader in python 3**

  Using the agent no longer generates a deprecation warning for find_loader. The call to find_loader has been replaced with find_spec.
