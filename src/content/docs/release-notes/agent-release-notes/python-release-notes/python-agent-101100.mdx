## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for Google Gemini via the Google Generative AI SDK and instruments new Kinesis methods.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add support for Google Gemini via Google Generative AI SDK

  * Adds support for [google-genai](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/). The agent will automatically instrument `embed_content` calls for synchronous and asynchronous [embeddings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings). The agent also now supports synchronous and asynchronous [text generations](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation) for text inputs in non-streaming cases. This includes calls made to `generate_content` for single text-only inputs and calls to `send_message` for multi-turn conversations.

* Instrument new AWS Kinesis methods

  * Adds [botocore](https://pypi.org/project/botocore/) instrumentation to support new [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) methods including `tag_resource`, `untag_resource`, and `list_tags_for_resource`.


## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
