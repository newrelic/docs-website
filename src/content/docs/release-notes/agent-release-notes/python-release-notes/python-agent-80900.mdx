## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for [RedisCluster](https://pypi.org/project/redis/).

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Enhancements

* **Add support for RedisCluster**
Adds instrumentation support for [RedisCluster](https://pypi.org/project/redis/).

## Bug fixes

* **Resilient Environment Settings**
Fixed a crash when using [generalimport](https://pypi.org/project/generalimport/) with the agent.  Thanks for the contribution, [aaeabdo](https://github.com/aaeabdo)!

* **Remove deprecated `drop_transaction` calls from agent**
The `drop_transaction` function had been removed from the agent but references to it still existed, so this version of the agent removes any remaining calls.

* **Fix logic in serverless distributed tracing to work by default**

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date. 

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
