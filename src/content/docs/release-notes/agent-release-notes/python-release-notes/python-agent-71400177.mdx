## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for aioredis, enhances support for redis and aredis, and fixes a deprecation.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* **Add support for aioredis**

  The agent will now automatically instrument and send metrics for applications using the Redis and StrictRedis clients for aioredis.


## Improvements

* **Enhance support for redis and aredis**

  The agent now instruments a more extensive list of commands for redis and aredis clients. This includes commands under the search, graph, timeseries, json, sentinel, and bf modules.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix `threading.currentThread` deprecation**

  `threading.currentThread` was [deprecated in Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.10.html#deprecated) and has been replaced with `threading.current_thread`. Thank you [hugovk](https://github.com/hugovk) for your contribution to the agent!
