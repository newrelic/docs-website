## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds support for reporting datastore instance information for the [elasticsearch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elasticsearch) library.

Over the past few releases, support has been added to the agent for collecting datastore instance information for a number of drivers. See a [complete list of supported packages](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues#python-compatibility).

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

## New Feature

* **Datastore instance information for elasticsearch**

  For operations made using the official [Elasticsearch client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elasticsearch), the Python agent will collect the host and port of the elasticsearch server. This data will be displayed in transaction traces and in slow query traces in APM.

## Bug Fix

* **Cornice 2.3.0 TypeError**

  When using the latest version of [Cornice](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cornice),the Python agent would raise a `TypeError` exception due to not handling the changed signature of `cornice.Service.decorate_view()`. Earlier versions of Cornice were not affected, and with this release, the Python agent no longer raises an error for version 2.3.0.
