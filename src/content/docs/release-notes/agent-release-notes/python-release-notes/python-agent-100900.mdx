## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/database/database-spans.md) compatible datastore span attribute names, fixes a bug in [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) instrumentation, and temporarily disables [Kombu](https://pypi.org/project/kombu/) instrumentation. 

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New features

* Add OpenTelemetry compatible datastore span attributes

  * The datastore span attributes are now more consistent with [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.24.0/docs/database/database-spans.md) naming conventions

## Bug fixes

* Fix LangChain instrumentation for string response types

  * Previously, when [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) returned string-type responses, the agent only captured the first character of the string. This has been corrected.

* Disable Kombu instrumentation

  * Existing [Kombu](https://pypi.org/project/kombu/) instrumentation in the agent is crashing with a `TypeError` being raised from the `inspect` module. This instrumentation has been temporarily disabled and will be re-enabled in a future release once the root cause of the crash is identified and patched.

## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
