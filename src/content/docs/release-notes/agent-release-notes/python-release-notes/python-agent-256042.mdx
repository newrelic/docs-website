### Notes

This release of the Python agent adds much more flexibility around what attributes are sent to New Relic, and where they are displayed.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Feature

* Flexible capturing of attributes

Attributes are key-value pairs that contain additional information to be added to an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in New Relic APM, traced errors in New Relic APM, transaction events in Insights, and page views in Insights.

A number of new configuration settings have been introduced to allow you to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations.

For details, see [Python agent attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/attributes/python-agent-attributes).

### Deprecated Settings

Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are `capture_params` and `ignored_params`. It is still possible to achieve the same functionality as the old settings by using the new `attributes.include` and `attributes.exclude` settings. For examples, see [Python agent attribute examples](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/attributes/python-attribute-examples#ex_req_params).

A complete list of deprecated settings can be found in [deprecated configuration settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/attributes/enabling-disabling-attributes-python#deprecated).

While the usage of deprecated settings is still supported, we recommend upgrading your configuration to use the new settings as soon as possible.

### Changed Feature

Previously, it was possible to save a list, dict, or tuple as an attribute value that could be displayed in transaction and error traces. However, these same attributes could not be displayed in Insights events. Now, all attributes are handled in a consistent manner, which means that all attribute values must be one of the following types:

```
Python 2: str, unicode, int, long, float, bool
Python 3: str, bytes, int, float, bool
```

All values which are not one of these types are automatically converted by calling `str(value)`.
