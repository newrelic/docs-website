## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes the logs in context feature and bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Features

* **Logs In Context**

  The logs in context feature is now supported by the PythonaAgent. For more information, see the [Python logs-in-context page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-python).

## Bug Fixes

* **The plugin list in the environment page may have been inaccurately reported**

  When using absolute imports in Python 2, the agent may have reported relative imports that were attempted but unsuccessful. Python 3 is not impacted. Modules are now reported correctly in Python 2.
