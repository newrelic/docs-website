## Notes

This release of the Python agent adds instrumentation for aiohttp client.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Add instrumentation for aiohttp client**

  Outbound HTTP requests through the aiohttp library are now recorded. aiohttp Cross Application Tracing is now supported for outbound requests. In addition to Service Maps, applications accessed through the aiohttp client will now appear in transaction traces.

## Bug Fixes

* **Fix crash when using psycopg2 v2.7 composable queries**

  The psycopg2 library introduced a module to generate SQL dynamically (psycopg2.sql) in version 2.7. Passing a Composable type object (psycopg2.sql.Composable) to execute or executemany resulted in an application crash. The agent now correctly handles psycopg2 Composable objects.
