### Notes

This release of the Python agent enables the ability to add Custom Insights Events through a new `record_custom_event()` API.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### New Feature

* Custom Events

Prior to this release, the Python agent had the capability to record two types of Insights events automatically: `Transaction` and `TransactionError` events. In addition, custom attributes could be added to those events. Now, with the addition of the [`record_custom_event()`](/docs/agents/python-agent/customization-extension/python-transaction-api#record_custom_event) API, it is possible to define your own custom event types, enabling greater flexibility about what types of events you can view and query in Insights.

For details, see the Insights documentation on [Inserting Custom Events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events-new-relic-apm-agents).

### Changed Feature

* Attributes renamed

Two attributes have been renamed, in order to be consistent with the naming convention of other New Relic agents. The affected attributes are:

* `response.headers.contentLength` (was `response.contentLength`)
* `response.headers.contentType` (was `response.contentType`)
