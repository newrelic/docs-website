## Notes

This release of the Python agent removes support for Python 3.6. It also includes new instrumentation for Daphne, reporting installed module versions, and a fix for a bug affecting Loguru file paths.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Deprecations

* **Removed support for Python 3.6**

  Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the agent. Please consider upgrading your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python Agent.

## New features

* **Add Daphne instrumentation**

    Instrumentation has been added for [Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne), a Django project ASGI web server and the recommended server for [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploying.html).

* **Add module version reporting**

    Installed python packages now have their versions reported and are visible in the Environment tab for your application in New Relic One.

## Bug fixes

* **Fix a bug in file path detection for Loguru**

    Wrappers from the agent interfered with Loguru file path detection for templating messages. This has been corrected on all versions. Thank you to [@rafaelclp](https://github.com/rafaelclp) for your contribution!

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [5.0.2.126](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-502126/).
