### Notes

Fixes

* Fixed a bug whereby IIS applications with underscore characters in their names were not displayed correctly in the Status Monitor.
* Fixed a bug whereby users could not view the log file for some IIS applications in the Status Monitor.

Improvements

* Improved the naming of MVC transactions. Naming to controller/action should be much more reliable now.
* Improved WebAPI support. You should now see Web Transactions grouped by \[controller].\[action] rather than all WebAPI transactions reporting as System.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpControllerHandler.
