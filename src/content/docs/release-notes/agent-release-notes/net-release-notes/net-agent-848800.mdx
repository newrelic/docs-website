### New Features

* SQL query parameter values can now be captured on Slow SQL Traces. This feature can be enabled with the new configuration option `datastoreTracer.queryParameters`. The `transactionTracer.record_sql` configuration option must also be set to `raw`. See documentation [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#datastore-tracer-query-parameters). This feature should be used with caution as it can lead to the capture of sensitive data. High-security mode prevents the use of this feature. Windows support only. Linux support coming soon.
* **\[.NET Framework]** Adds support for tracking async transactions when .ConfigureAwait(false) is used from async controller actions in ASP.NET MVC applications.
* **\[.NET Core]** Adds support for .NET Core 2.1. Support for .NET Core 2.1 requires at least CLR version 2.1.3 and tiered compilation must not be enabled.

### Fixes

* **\[.NET Core]** Fixes issue where status code based errors would be reported instead of the actual noticed Exception. This most commonly occurred with errors noticed in the `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` (app.UseExceptionHandler(...)).
* Fixes an issue where only the first request parameter is captured when `request.parameters.*` attributes are added to an include list.

### Notes

* We will be removing the `core_20` directory from the download site the week of September 3rd, 2018 as it contains a deprecated version of the .Net Core agent. Please be sure to update any of your scripts that reference this location accordingly.
  * All downloads for the current version of the agent can be found in the `latest_release` directory on the download site.
  * Historical versions can be found in the `previous_releases` directory.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
