version: 8.0.0.0

### New Features

* Adds `stripExceptionMessages` configuration option to the `newrelic.config` file. When enabled, this will remove error messages from errors that are reported to New Relic. This is the same behavior as having High-security mode enabled but can be used without High-security mode. The default value for this setting is `false`.

### Fixes

* Security Bulletin [NR18-07](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-07): The agent will no longer run explain plans on MySQL queries that have multiple statements.

### Other Changes

* In order to increase security, disabling agent HTTPS communication via the service SSL configuration is no longer allowed.
* WCF service parameters are now captured as `request.parameters.*` attributes and are no longer sent as `service.request.*` attributes.
* Minimum version required for use in EU Datacenter.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
