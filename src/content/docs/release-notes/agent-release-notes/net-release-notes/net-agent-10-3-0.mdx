<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping your agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

As of this release, the oldest supported version is [.NET agent 8.20.262.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/agent-8202620).

### New features
* Custom event limit increase
  * This version increases the default limit of custom events from 10,000 events per minute to 30,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable maximum limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, see [the docs for max_samples_stored](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/#custom_events). To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see [our Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/send-more-custom-events-with-the-latest-apm-agents/190497).
