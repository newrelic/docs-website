### Notes

* Do a better job of exercising some diagnostic print statements.
* Strip off the generic qualifier (backtick and beyond) in Exception names when comparing names with a list of exception names to ignore.
* Make the diagnostic tool more robust, and release in an architecture-neutral format.
* The diagnostic tool now only writes to stdout.
* Change SQL obfuscator to correctly handle escaped quotes in strings, and to obfuscate more literal constants.
* Log (at finest level) obfuscated SQL and the generated metric name for SQL queries.
* Change the diagnostic tool to ternary logic, reporting PASS, WARN and FAIL; some errors reading registry now marked as WARN.
* Disable tracers for HttpWebRequest.SerializeHeaders and HttpWebResponse.Close, as the data collected by those is not yet used.
* Copy comments from newrelic.xml into newrelic.xsd to help xml aware editors.
* Log timestamps now contain millisecond accurate data.
* Stability enhancements in profiler core.
* Fix fusion log binding errors from the New Relic Agent.
