### Notes

Improvements

* Adds instrumentation support for Oracle's ManagedDataAccess APIs. Now any applications using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client methods will get database instrumentation for those method calls.
* Adds better support for Windows Communication Foundation applications that are hosted by IIS.
* Changed agent logs to use UTC timestamps instead of local server timestamps. This should allow us to resolve customer issues more quickly.
* Changes the agent to depend on .NET 3.5. Your application can still target .NET 2.0, but you must have .NET 3.5 installed on the computer the agent is executing on.

Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the Agent was not respecting the server side enable error collection setting.
