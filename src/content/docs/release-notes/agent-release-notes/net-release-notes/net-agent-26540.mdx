### Notes

New Features

* Added ability to enable/disable various parameter information via agent configuration. This includes the default setting to not capture a username from the security principal associated with a web application.

Fixes

* Fixes instances where the AgentEnabled setting was set to false and the NewRelic.Agent.IL.dll was not getting unloaded from the process. No code was ever executed from the module when the agent was disabled but the module needed to be unloaded so that the process would correctly reflect the actual modules that were being used.
* Fixes an issue where the user could not override the default naming of a transaction using the agent API.
