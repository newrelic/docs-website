### Notes

Fixes

* Fixed an issue where if an application was not using real user monitoring (RUM) the field that is used for that data was not being properly cleared.
* Fixed an issue where an implementation of ExtensionAttribute was overriding the .net 4.0 framework's CompilerServices.ExtensionAttribute. The agent will now use the appropriate implementation of ExtensionAttribute based on the given framework.
