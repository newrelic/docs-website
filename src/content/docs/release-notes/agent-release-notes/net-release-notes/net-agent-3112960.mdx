### Fixes

* Fixes a bug where setting transaction trace threshold from the New Relic UI would cause it to revert to default.
* Fixes a bug where the cross application map would sometimes show the wrong color (apdex) line between nodes.
* Fixes a bug where the New Relic tray application would report IIS 7+ as not running if one of the application pools was stopped.
