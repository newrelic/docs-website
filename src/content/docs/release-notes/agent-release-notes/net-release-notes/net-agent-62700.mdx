### Download URLs

Download the appropriate release for your New Relic .NET agent:

* [.NET Framework](https://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/6.x_release/)

### New Features

* **CI/Deployment moved to GitHub Actions**  
  This release is functionally identical to version 6.26.0. We have migrated our CI and deployment process for the 6.x agent to GitHub Actions, and this release validates that this process is working correctly. There is no need to upgrade from 6.26.0 to 6.27.0.

### Support statement

New Relic recommends staying current with the latest 6.x version. The .NET Agent 6.x updates include only security-related fixes. Active development of features and other bug fixes is no longer supported.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
