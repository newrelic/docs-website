### New Features

* Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products. For more information, see [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-dashboard)

### Fixes

* Non-IIS applications no longer use the process name as an application name unless no other name is provided. This brings non-IIS application naming in-line with IIS application naming and all of the same naming rules should apply.
* Fixes a bug where simple transactions wouldn't be available to insights for queries. This was most likely to occur with custom applications or WCF applications.
* Fixes a security issue where proxy credentials could be written to the agent log file if you supplied them in the hostname (e.g., user:[password@proxy.com](mailto:password@proxy.com):1234).
* Fixed a bug that caused the .NET agent to corrupt some non-HTML resources if browser monitoring was enabled.
