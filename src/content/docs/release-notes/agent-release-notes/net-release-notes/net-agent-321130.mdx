### Notes

New Features

* Support for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) now includes:

  * self-hosted (i.e., hosted outside of IIS) services
  * services hosted by IIS whether or not ASP.NET Compatibility Mode is used.
  * service request parameters can be viewed in a transaction trace summary or in an error summary. By default, these parameters are not captured, but can be enabled and filtered in the newrelic.config file using a new parameter group named 'serverRequestParameters'. See the online documentation for more details.

Note: This release is not currently supported for installation via the Azure Web Sites NuGet package. We will be updating that NuGet package at a later time.
