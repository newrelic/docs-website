**Notice:** If using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging as your logging framework of choice, please use .NET agent version 10.1.0 or newer.  We encourage you to adopt the newer version due to bug [#1230](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/issues/1230), which we fixed in [#1237](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1237), that was resolved in .NET agent version 10.1.0.

### New Features
* Support of setting up labels via appsettings.json and app/web.config file. [#1204](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1204)
* Additional DEBUG-level logging of all environment variables.
* Forwarded application logs now capture exception details including, error message, error stack, and error class. [#1228](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1228)
  * Log events with no message will now be accepted if an exception is present in the log event.
  * The error stack is created using the stack of the inner exception, up to 5 levels deep, just like existing Agent error reporting.
* Adds a new `SetName()` method to the Agent API for spans which allows customization of segment/span/metric names. [#1238](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1238)

### Fixes
* Resolves an issue where log forwarding could drop logs in async scenarios. [#1174](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1201)
* Resolves an issue where more logs were forwarded than expected from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. [#1237](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1237)
* Resolves an agent configuration bug where values set in the `MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED` and `MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED` environment variables, which configure the maximum samples stored per one-minute harvest interval, were not being properly converted to apply to the five-second harvest interval for those data types. [#1239](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1239)
