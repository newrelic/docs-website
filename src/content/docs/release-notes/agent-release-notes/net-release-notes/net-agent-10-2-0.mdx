### New Features
* Add new environment variables to control `SendDataOnExit` functionality: `NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT`, `NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT_THRESHOLD_MS`. [#1250](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1250)
* Enables integration with CodeStream code-level metrics by default. This allows you to see golden signals in your IDE through New Relic CodeStream without altering agent configuration. [Learn more here](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/other-features/net-codestream-integration). For any issues or direct feedback, please reach out to support@codestream.com. [#1255](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1255)

### Fixes
* Resolves an issue where the .NET Core agent could crash during application shutdown when SendDataOnExit functionality was triggered. [#1254](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1254)
* Resolves an issue where the .NET agent incorrectly injects the browser agent script inside HTML pages. [#1247](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1247)
* Resolves an issue where some instrumentation was missing for `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` in .NET Framework. [#1248](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1248)
* Resolves an issue with local log decoration for NLog where the original log message was not included in the output. [#1249](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1249)
* Resolves an issue where the .NET agent failed to serialize custom attributes containing some non-primitive types. [#1256](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1256)
* Includes missing profiler environment variables in debug logs during application startup. [#1255](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1255)
* Resolves an issue where the .NET agent still sends up disabled event types during reconnecting period. [#1251](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1251)
