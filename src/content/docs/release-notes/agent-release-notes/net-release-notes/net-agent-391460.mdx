### New Features

* Added support for agent-side creation of application labels and categories via [newrelic.config](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#labels) or the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable.

  Labeling enables organization of applications with labels and categories. The APM UI will use these labels and categories to group, filter and organize all your applications in a meaningful way; this is particularly useful if you have many applications. For more information, see [Labels and categories](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).

### Fixes

* Fixes a race condition that could lead to a small amount of missing data and in some rare cases, excessive CPU utilization. Most likely to occur with WCF applications under heavy load.
* Fixes a bug where turning on high-security mode and turning off SQL would result in receiving obfuscated SQL.
