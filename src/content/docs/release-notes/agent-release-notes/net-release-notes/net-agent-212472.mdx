### Notes

Fixes

* Addresses an issue where the Real User Monitoring (RUM) footer was being injected outside of the body close tag in Web Forms applications, creating invalid markup. Also improves the performance of the auto instrumentation of RUM in Web Forms applications.
* The Apdex score (Satisfied, Tolerating, Frustrating) was being incorrectly reported for Key Transactions, and was also skewing the overall Apdex score.
