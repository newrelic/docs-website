* Adds an API method for telling the agent to start reporting at runtime.

### Fixes

* Fixes a bug where self-hosted WCF applications would not correctly report on the overview page.
* Fixes a bug where database calls and external calls in a background/async thread would result in a transaction named `*` showing up in the Other bucket.
* Fixes a bug where apdex was not reported for self-hosted WCF applications.
* Fixes a bug where API calls from an application that didn't have any instrumentation would not report any data.
* SQL object names are more accurately parsed. In particular, table names will be recognized with an expanded set of characters. The agent is able to parse table names with a variety of separator characters and formatting whitespace. For example, `{Table1}`, `[ Table2 ]`, `"Table3"` and `Table4`.

### Known Issues

  If you are using WebAPI and targeting .NET Framework 4.0 then you may need to opt-in to a .NET Framework 4.5 bug fix in order to continue seeing web transactions! For more information, see [WebAPI transactions are missing](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/webapi-transactions-are-missing).
