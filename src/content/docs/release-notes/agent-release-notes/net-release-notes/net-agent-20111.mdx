New Features

* The agent diagnostic utility, NewRelic.DiagnosticTool.exe, now supports a "verbose" mode as a command-line option (-v or -verbose). If you do not use the option, you will just get the failures and warnings. If you use the -v option, the output will include failures, warnings and passed test results. In previous versions of the agent, the diagnostic utility always output all results, making it more difficult to easily see where the failures were.

Fixes

* Removed all of the static docs from the installer. All documents for the .net Agent are now available at: [https://newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/](https://newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/)
* Changed the way the agent gets the urls for each web-based transaction from the built-in .NET RawUrl property to using the url off of the request. This will help keep urls reported by the agent consistent and prevent exceptions when raw representations of the url do not exist
* Significant improvements around the way the agent loads assemblies for instrumentation. This should help individual application load times as well as load times when instrumenting multiple applications on a single server
