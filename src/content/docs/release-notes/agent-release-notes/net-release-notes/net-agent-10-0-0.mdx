**Notice:** If using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging as your logging framework of choice, please use .NET agent version 10.1.0 or newer.  We encourage you to adopt the newer version due to bug [#1230](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/issues/1230), which we fixed in [#1237](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1237), that was resolved in .NET agent version 10.1.0.

### New Features

* Adds support for forwarding application logs to New Relic for .NET Framework 4.6.2 and newer applications using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. [#1172](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1172)
* Additional agent configuration options are now visible and easily accessible through the UI on NR1. Agent configuration is also now reported during agent connect. This information can be seen in the APM->Environment->Agent Initialization view. [#1174](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1174)

### Fixes

* Resolves an issue with transaction trace aggregation where the slowest transaction trace was not always captured due to a race condition. [#1166](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1166)
* Adds an ignore rule to prevent profiling SMSvcHost.exe. [#1182](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1182)
* Updates applicationLogging attribute log.level to be level. [#1144](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-agent/pull/1144)

### Deprecations/Removed Features

* This is a major release of the agent, and contains breaking changes. See the migration guide for details.
