### Notes

New Features

* Adds Percentiles and Histograms
* Adds the ability to instrument processes from IIS Express which include Azure Compute Emulator, Web Matrix and Visual Studio. By checking the "Instrument all .NET Applications" checkbox during the installation developers will now be able to get instrumentation on all web applications running as a hosted IISExpress process.

Fixes

* Fixes logging during the installation of the .NET Agent for when the installer looks for an existing license key and on cleanup methods. Now when running installer using msiexec with options /i and /l\*v it will now properly report the status of all installer actions in the log output.
* Fixed a bug that would cause a stack overflow if you tried to instrument a generic method with multiple instantiations.
