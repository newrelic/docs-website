### New Features

* Additional Transaction Information applied to Span Events When Distributed Tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, the Agent will now incorporate additional information from the Transaction Event on to the root Span Event of the transaction. The following items are affected:

  1. Request Parameters request.parameter.\*
  2. Custom Attribute Values applied to the Transaction via API Calls AddCustomParameter and ITransaction.AddCustomAttribute.
  3. request.uri
  4. response.status 5 host.displayName
* Security Recommendation Review your [Transaction Attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#transaction_events) configuration. Any attribute include or exclude settings specific to Transaction Events, should be applied to your [Span Attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#span_events) configuration or your [Global Attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#agent-attributes) configuration.

### Fixes

* Fixes issue where updating custom instrumentation while application is running could cause application to crash.
