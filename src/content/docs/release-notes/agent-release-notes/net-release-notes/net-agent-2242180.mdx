### Notes

Improvements

* Improves transaction breakdown and transaction trace views by filtering certain .NET Framework methods.
* Due to the performance impact, adding "NewRelic_BrowserTimingHeader" and "NewRelic_BrowserTimingFooter" to manually-instrument browser monitoring (RUM) has been deprecated. The recommended method for manual instrumentation is to use the New Relic .NET Agent API. See the documentation page: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/real-user-monitoring-in-net](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/real-user-monitoring-in-net) for details.
* Reduced the overhead of the agent through improved targeting of instrumented methods.
* Removes an erroneous error log message related to attempting to instrument RefEmit_InMemoryManifestModule.

Fixes

* Fixes a bug where sometimes thread profiles would not display properly after being collected successfully.
* Fixes an issue where System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.Open() metric was being removed from traces making it more difficult for users to gain visibility into how many database connections each transaction in their app was opening.
* Fixes a bug where the agent wouldn't increment the total errors count for errors reported via the API that occurred outside of a transaction.

NuGet

* Fixes an issue where after deploying Windows Server monitor using the nuget package to Windows Azure the service will be in a stopped state. The Windows Server monitor will now start after deployment. Thanks [Steven Kuhn](https://github.com/chartek) for the contribution!
