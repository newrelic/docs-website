## New Relic PHP Agent v9.17.1

### Bug Fixes

* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/148) instances where the agent's `mysqli_commit` instrumentation returned a NULL instead of a boolean.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/146) an issue where parameters were not passed by reference in the agent's pdo instrumentation. This caused a warning in PHP 8.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/145) instances where an `Unknown PHP version: 8.0` error was occurring when installing on Debian and Ubuntu systems.

### Support Statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [8.6.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-860238/).
