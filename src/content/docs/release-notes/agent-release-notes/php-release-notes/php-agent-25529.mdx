### Notes:

* New feature: slow SQL. This is very similar to transaction traces but instead records the 10 slowest SQL statements, along with a stack trace of where the SQL was executed from in your program.
* Fixed a bug in the automatic insertion of RUM headers and footers where they could sometimes be inserted multiple times (especially the footer).
* The "Drupal Modules" feature can now be enabled and disabled on a per-directory basis like most other configuration settings.
* A few minor bug fixes that had the potential for causing random agent crashes, although these were very infrequent.
