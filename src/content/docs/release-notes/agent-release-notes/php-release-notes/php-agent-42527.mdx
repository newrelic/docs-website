### Notes

* Fix a segfault that could occur when the daemon was unable to bind to its listening socket during startup. The watcher process would then attempt to spawn a new daemon process leading to another segfault creating a loop. This loop would then cause the daemon log file to grow indefinitely. All customers are encouraged to upgrade.
