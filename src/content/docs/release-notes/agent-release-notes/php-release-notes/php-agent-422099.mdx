### New Features

#### Support for the Predis library

The PHP agent now supports the Predis library. Users of this library will see new metrics in the Database tab, nodes in transaction traces, and breakdown metrics on individual transaction pages. Pipelining multiple commands will result in those commands being grouped and treated as a single command metric named `pipeline`.

Note that our Predis support does not include instrumentation for commands wrapped in `MULTI` and `EXEC` via the Predis client's `transaction` method. We also do not instrument the `executeRaw` or `monitor` methods of Predis, nor its PubSub functionality.

#### Increased specificity of PECL Redis metrics

Metrics made for the PECL Redis extension will now more closely match the name of the function called. For example, the `redis::setex` method will now create a metric with the text `setex`, rather than simply `set`.

#### Named Laravel Artisan commands

Background transactions that are Laravel Artisan commands are now named. Instead of being named `unknown`, Laravel Artisan commands will now be named based on the command. For instance, the command `./artisan cache:clear` will result in a background transaction named `Artisan/cache:clear`.

#### UTC offsets in agent logfiles

The log file format has been extended to include the UTC offset of the local timezone. This makes it easier to match log entries to time windows in the New Relic UI.
