### New Features

* The daemon now uses openssl 1.0.1j, rather than 1.0.1h.
* Support for generating explain plans for SELECT queries issued using the PDO MySQL driver has been added.

  When the [newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelicini-settings#inivar-tt-epenabled) setting is enabled and a SELECT query is issued through a PDO connection to MySQL that takes longer than [newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelicini-settings#inivar-tt-epthreshold), an explain plan will be generated and will appear within the query analysis section of the [slow SQL trace](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/database-and-slow-sql-dashboard#db_slowsql).

### Bug Fixes

* Fix an issue that could cause some background task metrics to be attributed to web transactions and some web transaction metrics to be attributed to background tasks. This could affect Drupal customers whose applications use `drupal_cron_run`.
* This release changes the handling of HTTP Referer headers to always strip query parameters before reporting to New Relic. Previously, any query parameters present in a Referer header would be reported to New Relic by the PHP agent.
* Fix an issue where urls using the file: protocol scheme with `curl_exec()` would cause the agent to record external metrics. This has been corrected and the agent will no longer treat file urls as external services.
