## New Relic PHP agent v12.0.0.25

### Bug fixes

* Improve drupal hook map error logging.
* Fix legacy package detection issues for [Security RX](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/vulnerability-management/overview/).

### Notice

#### Default value for `newrelic.code_level_metrics.enabled` INI has changed in this release

As previously communicated, the default Code Level Metrics [Observability in IDE](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/codestream/observability/code-level-metrics/) configuration will change in an this release from enabled to disabled.  If you do not use Code Level Metrics, you should see no impact and will not have to take any action.  If you do rely on [Code Level Metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/features/php-code-level-metrics/), ensure that your newrelic.ini configuration file has the  `newrelic.code_level_metrics.enabled` INI setting uncommented and set to true.
e.g:
```
newrelic.code_level_metrics.enabled = true
```
This change only impacts the default configuration value. Manually set configuration values will be honored, and core CLM behavior will remain unaffected.

### Support statement

* As previously communicated, the following frameworks/libraries that the PHP Agent has previously EOL'd support for will be removed in the this release:

  * Guzzle 3.x
  * Kohana
  * Silex
  * Symfony 1.x-3.x
  * Zend 1.x-2.x

* PHP Agent support for the following library/framework versions will end September 30, 2025:

  * WordPress 5.9
  * Drupal 8.x
  * Laravel 6.x, 8.x
  * PHPUnit 8.x

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [New Relic PHP Agent EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
  **For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform, it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and the removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.

  The PHP agent packages that are affected are:

  * newrelic-php5
  * newrelic-php5-common
  * newrelic-daemon
</Callout>
