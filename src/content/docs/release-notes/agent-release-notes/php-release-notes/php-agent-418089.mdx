### New Features

* Support for synthetic monitoring.

  The PHP agent now gives you additional information for requests from synthetic monitors when the `newrelic.synthetics.enabled` setting is enabled. The agent records more transaction traces and events for synthetic-originated requests to give you a clearer look into how your application is performing around the world.

  For more details, see [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-s...](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics)
* Add a new `newrelic_record_custom_event` API function.

  This API function allows you to add custom events to New Relic's Insights product. For more information, please see: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-queryi...](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events-new-relic-agents)
* The daemon now uses openssl 1.0.1k, rather than 1.0.1j.

### Bug Fixes

* The agent properly recognizes prepared statements constructed with `mysqli_stmt::__construct()`.
* The `newrelic-install` script has been fixed to once again work for users with custom `extension_dir` settings.

### Notes

* The ability to set the appname to a string like: `%{FOO}` and have `FOO` expand into the environment variable was removed.
