### Notes

* Show full URL of external calls in transaction trace nodes. Username, password, and query parameters are stripped from the URL.
* Fixed a bug causing time spent in background CLI tasks to be included in main overview graph.
* Fixed a bug causing incorrect custom tracer metrics in the event of out of order clock times.
* Look for and respond to 'X-NewRelic-ID' header in all incoming http requests. This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services in a service-oriented architecture for a forthcoming feature. In the meantime, if you wish to disable the header, set 'newrelic.cross_process.enabled=0' in your .ini file.
