End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Show full URL of external calls in transaction trace nodes. Username, password, and query parameters are stripped from the URL.
* Fixed a bug causing time spent in background CLI tasks to be included in main overview graph.
* Fixed a bug causing incorrect custom tracer metrics in the event of out of order clock times.
* Look for and respond to 'X-NewRelic-ID' header in all incoming http requests. This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services in a service-oriented architecture for a forthcoming feature. In the meantime, if you wish to disable the header, set 'newrelic.cross_process.enabled=0' in your .ini file.
