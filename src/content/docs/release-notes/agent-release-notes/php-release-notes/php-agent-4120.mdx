### New Features [#features]

* Added two new attributes to transaction events: `errorMessage` and `errorType`. These attributes allow for the tracking of errors within the Insights product. As a result, error messages will no longer be recorded if the agent is in high-security mode.
* Background tasks will now create Transaction events which can be tracked in the Insights product.

### Bug Fixes [#bugs]

* Fixed request queuing metrics support
  The PHP Agent will now allow the leading `t=` prefix to be optional when parsing `HTTP_X_REQUEST_START` and `X-Request-Start` headers. Previously, the header would be treated as absent if no leading `t=` was included.
* Fixed presentation of the `newrelic.daemon.proxy` setting in **phpinfo()**
  The **phpinfo()** function will now display a value of no value as the default for the `newrelic.daemon.proxy` setting. Previously, it would incorrectly display a value of `***INVALID FORMAT***`.
