## New Relic PHP agent v11.5.0.18

### New feature

* Adds support for PHP 8.4

### Bug Fixes

* Fix Drupal error and exception handling
    * This fix may conflict with the error and exception handling of the Drupal [new_relic_rpm](https://www.drupal.org/project/new_relic_rpm) module. If you have this module installed and you aren't seeing your errors reported natively by the agent, try disabling the new_relic_rpm module. If you still experience issues after disabling this module, please reach out to New Relic Support.
* Fix error where externalCallCount should be added to the transaction and not just the error event.
* Address aws-sdk-php versioning change. 

### Security

* Daemon golang.org/x/net module upgraded to v0.33.0

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every three months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [New Relic PHP Agent EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
  **For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform, it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and the removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.

  The PHP agent packages that are affected are:

  * newrelic-php5
  * newrelic-php5-common
  * newrelic-daemon
</Callout>
