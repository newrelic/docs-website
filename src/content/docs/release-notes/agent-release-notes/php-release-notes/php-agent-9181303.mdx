## New Relic PHP agent v9.18.1

### New features

* [Added](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/162) a Docker development environment. It's now possible for contributors to both develop and test (unit tests and integration tests) without setting up a specific environment on their own system. Please see our [documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/blob/main/docs/dev_environment.md) for more information.
* [Route caching in `Laravel 7.x` is now supported!](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/174). Transaction naming now works with routes cached via `php artisan route:cache`. @stockalexander, thanks for your contribution!
* `Redis::mget` and `Redis::mset` [functions are now supported](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/156). @b-viguier, thanks for your contribution!

### Bug fixes

* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/161) instances where a memory leak was occurring with our `curl multi` instrumentation.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/176) an issue where a supportability metric used to track an edge case was causing a segfault.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/87) an issue where PHP versions with an unknown API version were incorrectly handled during Debian package install.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/164) instances where `parent.transportDuration` values are `0` for transactions between two PHP applications instrumented through distributed tracing. @b-viguier, thanks for your contribution!
* [Fixed](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/158) an issue where the `newrelic.ini` configuration file was incorrectly installed. @b-viguier, thanks for your contribution!
