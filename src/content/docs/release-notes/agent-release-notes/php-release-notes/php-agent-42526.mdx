### Notes

* We've added support for Symfony 2. Symfony 2 controller names will now show up in the web transactions view. This is an intermediate step leading up towards future Drupal 8 support.
* We have improved Zend Framework 1 transaction naming in order to reduce instances of metric grouping issues.
* We have tidied up our code for handling slow SQL statements.
