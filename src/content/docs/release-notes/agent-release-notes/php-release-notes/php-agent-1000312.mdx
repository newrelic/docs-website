### New features ###
* The agent now incorporates updated backend communications which will pave the way to efficiently add new features.
* [Agent tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) are now supported by the PHP agent.

### Bug fixes ###
* Infinite tracing is now disabled at startup if distributed tracing is disabled since it is required ([Issue 452](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/452)).
* Removed a debugging statement that was no longer needed and could lead to large log file usage if verbose debugging was enabled ([Issue 447](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/447)).
* Additional fixes to significantly reduce the number of duplicated log messages in some situations where large log consumption had been observed in the past.

### Support statement ###
* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines please consult the following [document](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
