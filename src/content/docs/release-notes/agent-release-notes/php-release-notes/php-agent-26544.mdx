For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).

### Notes:

* There is an outstanding issue with the Zend View component where it kills the output buffer that auto-RUM relies on, so for this environment you will need to disable auto-RUM by setting newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument = 0 and doing manual instrumentation for the time being.
* Fixed a potential spin-loop that would cause the agent to consume 100% of the CPU if the underlying OS did not allow the daemon connection (even if the daemon was up and running).
* Only apply Real User Monitoring scripts to HTML content.
* Fix an issue if auto-RUM encountered content it couldn't parse, it would cause a segmentation violation and cause Apache to core-dump.
