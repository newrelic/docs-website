## New Relic PHP Agent v10.8.0.323

### New features

* Added `healthcheck` log level for the daemon, allowing for precise monitoring of the number of connected applications.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed debian package installation occasionally requiring an additional manual step [#634](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/634)
* Fixed a warning from agent when passing null as the second parameter to curl_multi_exec [#605](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/605). Special thanks to [dejanceltra](https://github.com/dejanceltra) for finding and fixing this issue!

### New Contributors

This release contains the first contribution to the New Relic PHP Agent from community member [dejanceltra](https://github.com/dejanceltra)! Thanks!!

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [PHP EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
**For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform (32 bit, FreeBSD, ZTS, etc), it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.
The PHP agent packages which are affected are:
   - newrelic-php5
   - newrelic-php5-common
   - newrelic-daemon
</Callout>
