### Notes:

* There was a bug in the `newrelic-install` script that under some circumstances would cause the script to use 100% of the CPU when installed via aptyum. This has been fixed.
* The particular User-Agent that was used when a slow transaction is recorded will now be displayed in the "Parameters" drop-down when viewing a transaction trace.
