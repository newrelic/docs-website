End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes:

* There was a bug in the `newrelic-install` script that under some circumstances would cause the script to use 100% of the CPU when installed via aptyum. This has been fixed.
* The particular User-Agent that was used when a slow transaction is recorded will now be displayed in the "Parameters" drop-down when viewing a transaction trace.
