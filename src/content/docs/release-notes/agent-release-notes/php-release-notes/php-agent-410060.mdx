### Notes

### End of Life Notices

* The MacOSX/Darwin agent and daemon are now compiled only for Mac OS X 10.6 or higher.

### New Features

* Changed the daemon to use openssl 1.0.1h, rather than 1.0.1g.
* Logging to stdout and stderr is now supported when running the daemon in the foreground.
* Created new installer for Ubuntu/Debian systems. If the application name is not present, the installation process will ask for one. Also, Debian/Ubuntu users do not have to run the newrelic-install script.

### Upgrade Notices

* The agent now supports PHP 5.6beta4.

### Bug Fixes

* Zend externals could be double counted when the cURL adapter was used. In previous versions of the agent, using `Zend_Http_Client::setAdapter()` with an instance of `Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Curl` caused the agent to double count the external call. This has been fixed.
* Prevent real user monitoring javascript injection when a Content-Type header has not been set and the default mimetype is not text/html.
