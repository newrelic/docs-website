### New Features

* **Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL data stores**  
  The agent will now provide a breakdown of SQL operations according to the database product being used. This is in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations. For NoSQL data stores, the agent will now provide a similar breakdown of the operations performed.
* **Memcached and Redis time reported separately**  
  Previously, the agent grouped Memcached and Redis operations into a single Memcached category. This is no longer the case. Time spent performing Memcached or Redis operations are separate.

### Bug Fixes

* **Laravel transaction naming improvements**  
  Prior to this version, Laravel applications that had replaced the default router service could find that, in some circumstances, their transactions would be named as "unknown" rather than being correctly named from the route. This has been improved: replacement router services will now get appropriate transaction naming provided that they either implement filtering or ensure that the same events are fired as the default Laravel router.
