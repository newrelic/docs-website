### New Features

* Our long-awaited support for Joomla 2.x and 3.x have been added. The PHP agent now instruments and names Joomla transactions without the need for additional plugins.

### Bug Fixes

* Prevent injection of page load timing JavaScript when the Content-Type is first set to **text/html** then changed to something else, such as **application/json**.
* Fix Zend Framework transaction naming when `exit()` is called during request processing. Previously, it was possible to exit before the agent set the transaction name. This caused the transaction to be reported as **index.php**, an issue that most commonly occurs with the Redirect action helper. The agent now correctly names these transactions.
* Fix segfault triggered by JSON encoding when strings to be encoded are marked as UTF-8, yet contain invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.
