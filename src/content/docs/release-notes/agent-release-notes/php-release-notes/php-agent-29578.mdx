### Notes:

This is a very minor patch release to the 2.9 series of PHP agent. It contains only 1 small fix which only affects customers who use more than 1024 Apache worker processes:

* Added missing ulimit command to daemon startup script to correctly set the maximum number of open file descriptors that the daemon can handle, in case the system default is too low.
