### Bug Fixes

* This release fixes a rare bug where applications that had the ionCube loader enabled and called `set_exception_handler()` repeatedly could crash.

### New Features

* Exceptions that are ignored by Laravel 5's default exception handler will also now be ignored by the PHP agent's error reporting feature. This can be controlled by adding or removing entries in the `dontReport` property of Laravel's default exception handler, as described [in the Laravel documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/errors#report-method).
