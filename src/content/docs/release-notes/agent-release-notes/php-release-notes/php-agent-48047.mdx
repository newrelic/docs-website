### Notes

### New Features

* Upgraded to cURL version 7.35 from 7.30.
* Upgraded to OpenSSL 1.0.1g from 1.0.1e.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue that would cause New Relic cross application tracing headers to accumulate during multiple `curl_exec()` calls.
* Fixed an issue with the installer when the path includes spaces. When `newrelic-install.sh` was run from a path that included spaces, such as `/tmp/new relic/newrelic-php5-4.6.5.40-linux`, the installation would fail. This has been corrected.
* Fixed an issue where not all Drupal 8 hooks were instrumented.

  While most Drupal 8 hooks are executed via `ModuleHandlerInterface::invoke()` and `ModuleHandlerInterface::invokeAll()`, a handful such as `page_build` are executed via variable functions by Drupal 8 as they require their arguments to be passed by reference. These hooks are now instrumented correctly.
