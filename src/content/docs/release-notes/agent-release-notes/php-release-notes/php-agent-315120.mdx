### Bugfixes

This release is a bug-fix release only and adds no new features to the agent. The following bugs introduced in 3.0/3.1 have been fixed:

* Fixed two segmentation violations that would occur after calling the `newrelic_set_appname()` API call. One had the potential to affect all users, the other was restricted to customers who used prepared SQL statements both before and after the call to `newrelic_set_appname()`.
* Fixed a problem with the Solaris init scripts which made the incorrect assumption about the process ID of init.
* Fixed a small memory leak that affected CodeIgniter, CakePHP and Drupal applications.
