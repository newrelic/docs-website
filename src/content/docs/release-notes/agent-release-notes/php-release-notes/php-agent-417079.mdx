### Bug Fixes

* The agent now uses the route pattern as the transaction name for unnamed, closure-based routes under Laravel. For example, the following route will now be named **hello/&#x7B;name}** instead of **GET/index.php**.

Route::get('hello/&#x7B;name}', function($name) &#x7B; return "Hello $&#x7B;name}!"; });

* Previously the agent could fail to detect the Laravel framework when `artisan optimize` was used. This has been fixed.
* When the agent cannot determine a transaction name for the Laravel framework, the name "unknown" will be used instead of "laravel-routing-error". The latter implied the cause of the failure may have originated within Laravel itself rather than solely within the agent's instrumentation.
