### Notes

This release of the New Relic PHP Agent improves real user monitoring and adds support for custom parameters in transaction analytics events. These changes were made to create a solid foundation for future enhancements. Additionally, an emphasis was placed on reducing the download size of the agent. As a result, the download size has been reduced by 75%.

### New Features

* Improve Real User Monitoring

  The PHP agent's code for both automatic and manual injection of Real User Monitoring scripts has been improved. No application changes are required, but the new injection logic is simpler, faster, more robust, and paves the way for future improvements to Real User Monitoring.
* Attach custom parameters to analytics events

  Custom parameters given to the agent through the API functions `newrelic_add_custom_parameter` and `newrelic_set_user_attributes` can now be automatically attached to transaction and page view analytics events. By default custom parameters will be attached to traces, errors, and transaction analytics events. Optionally, custom parameters can also be included in the JavaScript injected for Real User Monitoring. This allows custom parameters to be attached to page view analytics events.

  The behavior of custom parameters can be controlled through the following configuration settings, which are shown with their default values.

  `newrelic.transaction_tracer.capture_attributes = true newrelic.error_collector.capture_attributes = true newrelic.analytics_events.capture_attributes = true newrelic.browser_monitoring.capture_attributes = false`
