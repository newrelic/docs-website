## New Relic PHP Agent v10.3.0.315

### Important end-of-life information

* Support for 32 bit and FreeBSD binaries were deprecated with release v9.19.0.309 and **are no longer shipped starting with this release**.
* Support for ZTS binaries was deprecated with release v9.17.0.300 and will be **removed in a release in the near future**.
* **For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform (32 bit, FreeBSD, ZTS, etc), you must  disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent.** As an alternative, you could pin the PHP agent to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to do so could result in a newer release being installed without support for the system. This could disrupt APM data collection.
The packages which are affected are:
   - newrelic-php5
   - newrelic-php5-common
   - newrelic-daemon

* The (PHP agent compatibility and requirements)[https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/] page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

### New features

* APM logs in context. Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about this feature see [PHP: Configure logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php), and additional configuration options are available [PHP agent configuration: Config file](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#logs-in-context). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account see [Disable automatic logging](/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging).

### Bug fixes
* agent: Fix to ensure datastore segments do not create children segments. [#511](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/511)
* agent: Updates instrumentation lookups for PHP 7.4+. Using reserved field of zend_func's op_array is no longer reliable as other extensions are unreliably using this shared area which then corrupts the opcache enough that it no longer provides lookups. The new method no longer relies on the agent storing any information in the reserved array of a  zend_function.   Fixes: [Laravel 9 PHP8.1 Not reporting errors, All transactions are "unknown" bug](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/issues/387)


### Support statement
* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [PHP EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
