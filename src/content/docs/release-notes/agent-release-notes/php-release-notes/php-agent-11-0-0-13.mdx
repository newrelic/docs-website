## New Relic PHP agent v11.0.0.13

### New features

* Add countDocuments mongodb instrumentation for PHP 7.x ([#926](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/926))
* Doctrine 3.x verified and supported.
* Laravel 11 verified and supported. Note: excludes Laravel Horizon support.

### Security updates

* security(daemon): Upgrade golang to 1.22.5 ([#940](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/940))
* Instructions for configuring New Relic apt repository have been updated to no longer use deprecated apt-key utility. Please use the [updated instructions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-debian/#configure-repo)

### Important end-of-life information

* Support for PHP versions 7.0 and 7.1 has been EOLed and is removed in this release. If you are still using these PHP versions, please make sure to pin your agent version to 10.22.0.12.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [PHP EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
  **For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform, it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and the removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.

  The PHP agent packages that are affected are:

  * newrelic-php5
  * newrelic-php5-common
  * newrelic-daemon
</Callout>
