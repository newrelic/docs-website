## New features

* APM logs in context support for Monolog 2 and 3
  * The PHP agent will now generate logging metrics for Monolog (versions 2 and 3) to allow seeing the rate of log messages by severity. 
  * These metrics are enabled by default and are controlled by a config file directive.
  * The PHP agent can also now forward log messages from Monolog for viewing on the New Relic platform.  
  * Log forwarding is currently disabled by default (can be enabled by a config file directive), and will be enabled by default in a future release.

  To learn more about APM logs in context, see the [logs in context docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context).
