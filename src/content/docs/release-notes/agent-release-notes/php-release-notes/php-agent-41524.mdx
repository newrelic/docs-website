### Notes

* Transaction traces containing many consecutive calls to curl_multi_exec will now show the cumulative time as a single node. Previously the transaction trace would show one node for each call.
* We fixed segmentation faults when restarting Apache on Darwin and FreeBSD.
* We corrected an issue in the newest Debian-based Linux distributions that prevented the newrelic.ini file from being installed properly.
* A warning message is put in the agent log when newrelic_name_transaction() fails.
