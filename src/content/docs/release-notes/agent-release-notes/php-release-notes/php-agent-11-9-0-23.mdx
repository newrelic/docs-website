## New Relic PHP agent v11.9.0.23

### New features

* feat(agent): Add auto-instrumentation of object oriented hook implementations introduced in Drupal 11.1

### Other

* refactor(agent): Improve performance of user functions instrumentation for PHPs 8.0+

### Notice

The default Code Level Metrics configuration will change in an upcoming release from enabled to disabled. 
If you do not use Code Level Metrics, you should see no impact and will not have to take any action. 
If you do rely on Code Level Metrics, ensure that your newrelic.ini configuration file has the 
`newrelic.code_level_metrics.enabled` INI setting uncommented and set to true.
e.g:
`newrelic.code_level_metrics.enabled = true`
This change only impacts the default configuration value. Manually set configuration values will be honored, and core CLM behavior will remain unaffected.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [New Relic PHP Agent EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
* The [PHP agent compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/) page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

<Callout variant="important">
  **For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform, it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and the removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.

  The PHP agent packages that are affected are:

  * newrelic-php5
  * newrelic-php5-common
  * newrelic-daemon
</Callout>
