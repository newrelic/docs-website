### Notes

### New Features

* Support for custom SSL trust stores

  It is now possible to configure the agent to use a custom SSL trust store to authenticate New Relic's servers. In most cases this should not be necessary. The agent ships with the necessary certificates and will use them unless configured not to do so. Caution should be used with these settings. If the trust store does not contain the necessary certificates, the agent will be unable to report data to New Relic. See the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-daemon-settings) for more details.

### Bug Fixes

* `drupal_http_request` responses that redirect are no longer double counted

  External metrics created when `drupal_http_request` received a HTTP response that was a redirect, such as a 302 Found response, would have their execution time counted and call count incremented twice. The double counting has been removed, and the entire external time will be counted including any redirects.
* Fixed potential OpenSUSE 11.4 segmentation fault during Apache graceful restart
