End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes:

* Fixed an issue where using file_get_contents() could end up being mis-interpreted as an SQL node and cause a core-dump. This would only happen when Slow-SQL traces were enabled.
