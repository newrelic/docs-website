### Notes:

* Updated to work with Apache 2.4
* The auto-RUM buffer is now erasable, but doing so will obviously prevent auto-RUM from inserting the RUM header and/or footer.
* Fixed a problem where WordPress blogs would result in metric explosion due to their database table naming scheme
* Support transactions that last longer than 35 minutes. Long-running cron jobs will no longer report negative time.
