### New Features

* Support for agent-side configuration of application labels using the `newrelic.labels` INI setting has been added.
  New Relic enablesÂ you to label and organize your apps so they "roll up" into an unlimited number of meaningful categories. You can also easily sort, filter, and page through all the applications on your account's Applications list.
  See the [New Relic APM documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/categories-rollups-organizing-your-apps) and the [PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-newrelicini-settings#inivar-labels) for more details.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue that could prevent capturing database table name for prepared statements on PHP 5.6.
