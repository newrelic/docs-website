### Notes:

* Version number change. Starting with this release version numbers only use 2 segments, as in 2.3. The remaining bits simply reflect the build level.
* Naming web transactions for several new frameworks has been added: Joomla (1.5 and 1.6), Kohana (3.1 and 3.2), Magento 1.6 and MediaWiki 1.16.
* Drupal auto-RUM has been modified to inject the header earlier so that all CSS and JavaScript loading is taken into account, and it now also works when the advagg module is installed.
* Drupal modules support. This needs to be enabled by setting `newrelic.framework.drupal.modules=1.` This will display how much time is being spent in each Drupal module, including sub-modules. When enabled this feature is accessed from the "Modules" tab of the App Server menu.
* Support for MongoDB has been added.
* New API call `newrelic_ignore_apdex()` has been added. This allows users to ignore certain time-consuming activities (such as downloading a file) from their overall apdex score.
* PHP namespace separator () no longer causes a malformed JSON error when it appears in a transaction trace.
* SQL parser improved to better detect table names and avoid database metric explosion on certain SQL statements.
* Calls to `Drupal's drupal_http_request()`are now correctly identified as external service calls.
* Several speed improvements to further reduce the impact when Drupal Modules support or top100 is enabled.
* MacOSX agent no longer aborts when PCRE isn't loaded.
* RUM scripts improved to load the footer script after the page has fully loaded so that it does not impact user-visible performance.
* API functions `newrelic_get_browser_timing_header()` and `newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer()` now take an optional bool argument (that defaults to true) that indicates whether or not script start and end tags should be inserted around the returned JavaScript.
* Small memory leak when adding metric names fixed.
* Daemon startup scripts now correctly ignores comment lines
