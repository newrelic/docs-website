### Bug Fixes

* Under certain circumstances, version 4.23.0 of the PHP agent could crash when `newrelic_set_appname()` or `newrelic_end_transaction()` were called and a custom exception handler had been installed via `set_exception_handler()`. This has been fixed.
* Under certain circumstances, Drupal applications that rely on the `newrelic_set_appname()` API function to start transactions would not see the Drupal tab in the New Relic UI. This has been fixed.
