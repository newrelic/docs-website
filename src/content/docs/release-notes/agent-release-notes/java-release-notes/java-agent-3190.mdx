### Improvements

* Redis

  The agentâ€™s Redis instrumentation is now more efficient.

### Fixes

* In some cases the HttpClient 3 instrumentation could overstate the external call count.
* In rare cases the agent would report errors that it was configured to ignore.
* Some line numbers did not display correctly in stack traces.
