### Improvements

* Performance improvements

  The Java agent now starts up to 50% faster. Your applications will be available that much sooner.

### Fixes

* In some cases JAX-RS annotations on interfaces were not being observed, causing transactions using JAX-RS services to be named on the servlet rather than the web servicepath and method.
* Fixed an issue that prevents Spray and Akka-HTTP instrumentation from applying when using Scala 2.10.
* Fixed an issue that caused Play 2.x requests to produce empty responses when the circuit breaker is tripped.
* Fixed an issue where setting `enable_custom_tracing` to `false` could inadvertently disable Netty instrumentation.

### Known Issues

* Fixed in 3.29.0

  * Applications that use Play and Ning AsyncHttpClient may miss transactions.
  * The thread profiler may not report data while profiling certain Scala classes.
* Fixed in 3.28.0

  * Fixed a bug that could cause Akka Http instrumentation to throw a `NullPointerException` into customer code.
* Fixed in 3.27.0

  * Fixed an issue where the agent treated HTTP headers as being case sensitive, causing CAT to miss under certain conditions.
  * Fixed various issues related to the proper handling of multibyte character encoding.
* Fixed in 3.26.x

  * CXF instrumentation can name transactions based on auto-generated proxy classes. Later agents now normalizes CXF transaction names.
  * EJB instrumentation may cause a `NullPointerException` in application code, and erroneously set transaction names. In later versions, the agent records a metric.
  * The Cross Application Tracing API caused Application Response time to be attributed to other transaction time, and prevented linking of transaction traces when doing CAT.
  * Request queuing calculations could show queuing time as a steadily increasing value instead of the correct time.
  * HttpURLConnection External metrics may not report on the IBM J9 JVM.
  * Transaction traces may report external segments for non I/O calls in Apache HttpClient.
  * The Java agent will now read Cross Application Tracing HTTP header names regardless of case.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause cross application tracing between the New Relic Java agent and non-Java New Relic agents to fail.
