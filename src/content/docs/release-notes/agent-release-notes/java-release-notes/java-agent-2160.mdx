### Notes

* Adds a stack trace in the transaction trace for slow methods.

  This change provides additional insight into your slowest transactions.You can adjust how slow a method is before it generates the stack trace by setting stack_trace_treshold (in seconds).

  ```
  transaction_tracer:
    stack_trace_threshold: 1.0
  ```
* Cross Application Tracing support for HttpURLConnection.

  Adds request and response headers to external calls using the HttpURLConnection library to provided better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents (Java, .NET, and Ruby, with others coming soon).
* Fix: Cross Application Tracing does not correlate consistently when using WebSphere, WebLogic, Resin, and Glassfish.

  Cross Appplication Tracing did not correlate calling and called applications when the HTTP response was large.
* Queuing time more broadly supported.

  The 'X-Queue-Start' and 'X-Request-Start' request headers for Heroku and other frontend web servers are interpreted and reported. Previously, queuing time was not reported for Heroku.
* Work-around for Oracle JVM bug that in rare cases causes a native memory leak

  In rare cases, the Oracle JVM can leak native OS memory (not heap space) when classes are intercepted by the agent. This setting turns off interception of classes that are loaded after the given number of seconds. The agent will continue to monitor classes loaded before this time.

  ```
  class_transformer:
    shutdown_delay: 3600
  ```
