### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the agent would break webpage rendering by inserting New Relic Browser monitoring javascript into the `<header>` tag of pages which were missing `<head>` tags.
* Certain frameworks, like Spring Cloud Gateway, triggered a bug in the Spring webflux instrumentation, causing transactions to stay open until they timed out. This bug resulted in more memory pressure and looked like a memory leak. This has been fixed in this release.
* Fixed an issue where the agent would stop reporting to New Relic following a ForceDisconnectException and accumulate transaction data resulting in OutOfMemory Exceptions.
* The agent now validates that app_names only contains three application names. If the agent is configured to report more than three application names, the agent will log a warning message and stop reporting to New Relic.
* When a custom WSRequestFilter is used that modifies an outbound play-ws request, the agent would report overly long segments due to Segment timeouts and will also result in a loss of External/ metrics. This has been fixed.
