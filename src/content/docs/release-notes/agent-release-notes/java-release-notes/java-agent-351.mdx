### Notes

* Fix: Auto-RUM bug

  Starting in version 3.5.0 of the Java agent, in rare cases Auto-RUM could cause the New Relic header to be placed within a script tag. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: In rare cases, agent stops reporting

  In rare cases, the Java Agent hung on socketRead while performing an SSL handshake and would not report data until JVM restart. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: Occasionally missed web transaction when using ResultSet

  In version 3.5.0 of the agent some transactions that use a JDBC ResultSet were missing in the UI. The agent log would show an "Inconsistent State" error. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: X-Ray Sessions bugs.

  X-Ray Sessions sometimes returned no transaction traces. A memory leak with X-Ray Sessions when many sessions were run was also fixed.
