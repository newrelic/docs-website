### Notes

* Glassfish 2.1 JVM tab: The JVM tab will now show thread, session, and transaction metrics for Glassfish 2.1.

* Fix: Solr cache metrics: The solr cache metrics do not appear with versions 2.18 and 2.19 of the agent. This has been fixed, and all solr metrics should now appear.

* Fix: NullPointerException in New Relic agent logs when NewRelic API called: In certain circumstances, a call to a method on the `NewRelic` class can generate a `NullPointerException` in the agent logs. It does not cause a `NullPointerException` in your application.

* Fix: Support custom extension XML file for WebSphere with JRE: Prior to this fix, an attempt to use a custom extension XML file with a IBM JRE would lead to a `ClassNotFoundException`.
