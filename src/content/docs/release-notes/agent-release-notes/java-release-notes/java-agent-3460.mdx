### Improvements

* Websphere 9

With this release, the Java agent now supports Websphere 9, both Traditional and Liberty Profile.

More information on how to install and configure the Java agent on Websphere can be found here: [IBM WebSphere Application Server](/docs/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/ibm-websphere-application-server).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a potential deadlock scenario caused by the Java agent in high throughput applications running on Vert.x.
* Usage of the `setNull()` method on the JDBC interface now reports up `null` in the query string sent to New Relic, instead of incorrectly reporting up the `sqlType` as the value.
* Fixes a JVM crash that can occur when running the Java agent with the non-default `spring-aop-2` instrumentation enabled.
