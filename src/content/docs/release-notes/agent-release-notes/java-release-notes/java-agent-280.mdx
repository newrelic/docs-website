End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Supports basic proxy authentication for the case where there is a proxy server between the agent and the internet. The configuration uses proxy_user and proxy_password settings.
* To avoid reporting the same transaction trace repeatedly, the agent reports a number of the slowest transactions.
* Bug fix: Transaction trace reported to wrong app if enable_auto_app_naming and browser requested a transaction trace
