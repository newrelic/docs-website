### Notes

* Supports basic proxy authentication for the case where there is a proxy server between the agent and the internet. The configuration uses proxy_user and proxy_password settings.
* To avoid reporting the same transaction trace repeatedly, the agent reports a number of the slowest transactions.
* Bug fix: Transaction trace reported to wrong app if enable_auto_app_naming and browser requested a transaction trace
