### Fixes

Fixed a security issue that could send external HTTP request parameters to New Relic via [transaction traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/traces/transaction-traces) for applications that do all of the following:

* Use Java agent 3.6.0 or higher\*
* Use Apache HttpClient 4.0 or higher
* Haven’t [disabled transaction_traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Transaction_Tracer)

\*For Java agent versions 3.6.0-3.25.0, this issue only affects [cross-application traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing).

Recommended for applications that may include sensitive information in external service call request parameters.

If you can’t upgrade the agent immediately, there are a few workarounds:

* [Disable transaction traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configuring-transaction-traces)
* [Disable only cross-application tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Cross_Application_Tracer). This resolves the issue with Java agents prior to 3.26.0.

You can also [delete existing transaction traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/deleting-transaction-traces).
