### Notes

* Fix: Exceptions thrown from conflicting JAXB versions

  The New Relic Java agent now supports customers using any JAXB or Xerces version. This bug was introduced in version 3.1.0.
* Fix: Usage of the newrelic.bootstrap_classpath system property

  In version 3.2.0, the newrelic.bootstrap_classpath system property caused an IllegalAccessError. That bug has been fixed. Note also that this system property has been deprecated and should not be used.
* Fix: Data collection for customers using the IBM JVM without WebSphere

  New Relic now supports customers using an IBM JVM without running WebSphere. In this scenario, you must set the sync_startup flag set to true in the common section of their newrelic.yml.

  ```
  sync_startup: true
  ```
