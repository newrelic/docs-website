### Improvements

* Distributed tracing

Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.

Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the [transition guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) before you enable this feature.

To enable distributed tracing, set enabled to true in the `distributed_tracing` stanza in the newrelic.yml config file.

```
distributed_tracing:
    enabled: true
```

* Added configuration option `proxy_scheme` to allow the agent to connect via https only proxies.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where transaction throughput counts could be artificially inflated when using async servlets in Jersey.
* Fixed an issue where JBoss and Wildfly datasources could cause a `LinkageError`.
