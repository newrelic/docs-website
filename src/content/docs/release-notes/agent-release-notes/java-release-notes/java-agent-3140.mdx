### Improvements:

* Synthetic transaction tracing

  Synthetic monitors lets you monitor your site from around the world. When you use synthetic monitoring to monitor your Java application, up to 20 detailed transaction traces will now be captured every minute when the application is probed from synthetics. To learn more about this feature, visit our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collecting-synthetic-transaction-traces)
* EJB Session Beans

  The Java agent now monitors Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.0 session beans. The agent instruments @Stateless and @Stateful EJBs, and those that extend java.ejb.SessionBean. The agent traces methods declared by corresponding interfaces annotated with @Remote and @Local.
* Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products.

  The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB,and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases.

  This new unified Databases page will enable the filtering of metrics and operations by product, and includes a table listing all operations.

  Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the agent version on all hosts.If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views.
* Datastax Cassandra client

  Added support for the Datastax Cassandra client versions 2.1.2 or higher. This will include breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. Note: uses of the client's async API will not be captured in transaction traces.
* MongoDB client

  Added support for MongoDB client versions 2.12.0 up to but not including 3.0+. This will include breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces.
* API Reported Errors

  API reported errors can now be prioritized on a transaction over tracer reported errors. Add the following config to allow prioritizing:

  ```
  error_collector:
    ignoreErrorPriority: false
  ```

### Fixes:

* The Java Agent may now capture traces for transactions that resulted in an error (4xx or 5xx response code). Prior to this release, the agent would only capture traces for successful responses.
* Updated default newrelic.yml to use transaction_events.max_samples_stored instead of deprecated analytics_events.max_samples_stored property.
* JBoss dispatcher reports correctly for clustered environments where jboss.home and jboss.home.dir are not set.
* Resolved a bug which caused certain Jetty configurations to stop sending metric data.
* Under very light load, the Agent could send incorrect transaction timestamps.
* Fixed parsing error in log_file_count setting. Prior to this release, this setting produced one more log file than expected.
