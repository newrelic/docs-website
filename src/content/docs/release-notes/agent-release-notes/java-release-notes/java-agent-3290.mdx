### Improvements

* JDBC instrumentation

  * JDBC ResultSet instrumentation performance has been improved.
  * Instrumentation has been added for:
  * i-Net Merlia 7.0.3 database driver
  * Generic JDBC drivers
* Cassandra

  This release adds instrumentation for the Cassandra Datastax 3.0 Driver including slow query support. Youâ€™ll see relevant breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces.

  **Note:** Uses of the client's async API are not currently supported.

### Fixes:

* Fixed a bug which caused some applications that use Play and Ning AsyncHttpClient to miss transactions.
* Fixed an issue which would cause the thread profiler to not report data while profiling some Scala classes.
* Fixed a rare bug where a RuntimeException is thrown during class transformation which can prevent some instrumentation from being applied.
* Fixes a rare case where Tomcat ClassLoaders could leak memory when using a JDBC driver bundled in your application after reloading a web application.
