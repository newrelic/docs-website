### Notes

* Fix: Java agent should honor enable_auto_app_naming

  Starting with Java agent 3.3.1, the enable_auto_app_naming flag was being ignored. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: Setting configuration properties in newrelic.yml configuration file.

  Starting with version 3.0, some properties such as max_stack_trace_lines could not be set in the newrelic.yml configuration property. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: Java agent should honor JAX-RS annotations with New Relic annotations

  New Relic's Java agent should handle methods that contain a New Relic annotation along with a JAX-RS annotation correctly. Previously the New Relic annotation was being ignored.
* Fix: Play transaction does not complete until timeout expires

  New Relic's Java agent now handles firstCompletedOf to Futures correctly.
* Additional functionality to API call addCustomParameter

  New Relic's API call addCustomParameter will now add the custom parameters to New Relic Insights. For more information, see [http://newrelic.com/software-analytics](http://newrelic.com/software-analytics)
