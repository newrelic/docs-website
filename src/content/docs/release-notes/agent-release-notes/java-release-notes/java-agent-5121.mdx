### Notes

### Bug fixes

This is a patch release that resolves an issue in 5.12.0. With distributed tracing enabled and Infinite Tracing disabled, a defect in version 5.12.0 causes spans to be omitted from distributed traces.

Any customers currently on 5.12.0 are _strongly_ encouraged to upgrade to this 5.12.1 patch release.
