### Improvements

* Java 13

  The New Relic Java agent is now fully compatible with version 13 of the OpenJDK and Hotspot JDKs.

### Bug fixes

* Calls to NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addOutboundRequestHeaders() will no longer throw an exception if a traced method has started but a transaction has not. This could happen by calling this in a method annotated with `@Trace(async=true)` before a token is linked.
* Updates Guava to the newest release.
* NoClassDefFoundError would occur in agent logs when a spring controller is used without a root level RequestMapping annotation.
* The gc_time metric, which was enabled by default in version 5.2.0, has now been disabled by default since its results are often misleading.
