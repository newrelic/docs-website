### Improvements

* Distributed tracing: With [distributed tracing spans](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and/or [Infinite Tracing](https://newrelic.com/products/edge-infinite-tracing), the Java agent will now incorporate additional information from the [transaction event](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8236) on to the root [span event](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&field_data_source_tid%5B%5D=8332) of the transaction.
* New [TracedMethod.addCustomAttribute(...) APIs](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/TracedMethod.html) have been added for adding attributes directly to spans.

  **Note:** Any attribute include or exclude settings specific to transaction events should be applied to your span attributes configuration or your global attributes configuration.
* The Java agent now uses AWS's IMDS v2 to gather instance information.

### Fixes

* Jetty JMX metrics would not report when running embedded in Spring Boot.
* Local configuration settings could revert to the default following an agent reconnect.
