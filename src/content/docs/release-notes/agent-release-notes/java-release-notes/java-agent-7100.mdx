## New features and improvements

### Added the following Jakarta EE 9/9.1 compatible instrumentation:

* Jetty 11
* Tomcat 10
* Enterprise Java Beans 4.0
* Jakarta RS/WS
* Jersey 3+
* Jersey Client 3
* JSP 3
* Servlet 5 & 6
* Jakarata.xml
* JMS 3
* Glassfish 6.0
* Open Liberty 21.0.0.12+

### Code level metrics

For traced methods in automatic instrumentation or from @Trace annotations, the agent is now capable of reporting metrics with method-level granularity. When the new functionality [is enabled](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/features/java-codestream-integration), the agent will associate source-code-related metadata with some metrics. Then, when the corresponding Java class file that defines the methods is loaded up in a [New Relic CodeStream](https://www.codestream.com/)-powered IDE, [the four golden signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems#xref_monitoring_golden-signals) for each method will be presented to the developer directly.

### Agent log forwarding now adds the following attributes to log events for the log4j2 and logback1.2 frameworks:

* thread.name
* thread.id
* logger.name
* logger.fqcn
* error.class
* error.stack
* error.message

## Fixes

Fixed an issue with distributed tracing headers not being added on external requests made with the HttpUrlConnection client

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

**Full changelog**: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/compare/v7.9.0...v7.10.0


## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.7.0 and 7.8.0, the results printed to the console will be:

```
âžœ diff newrelic_7.7.0.yml newrelic_7.8.0.yml
98c98
<     #forwarding:
---
>     forwarding:
100,101c100,101
<       # When true, application logs will be forwarded to New Relic. The default is false.
<       #enabled: false
---
>       # When true, application logs will be forwarded to New Relic. The default is true.
>       enabled: true
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.8.0. If you are moving to 7.8.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.
