### Improvements

Java 15

* The New Relic Java agent is now fully compatible with version 15 of the OpenJDK and Hotspot JDKs.

APIs

* New [Segment.addCustomAttribute(...) APIs](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/Segment.html) have been added for adding attributes directly to spans.
* [Newrelic.addCustomParameter API](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/70) now supports boolean values

### Fixes

* The agent would try to read environment variables using system-property syntax. [It will now log the correct syntax and ignore the incorrect value.](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/39)

### Notes

* [The Java agent now includes the newrelic.com SSL certificate.](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/54) In previous agent versions, applications using a custom Truststore would have to provide their certificate or use the `use_private_ssl` configuration which was removed in 6.0.0.
* Fixed an issue where applications could fail to start due to the agent attempting to access the JMX MBean server before it was initialized.
