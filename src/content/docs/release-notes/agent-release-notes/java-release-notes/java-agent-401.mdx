### Fixes

* Fixes an issue Introduced in 3.48.0 with event sampling. The agent would only report the first [max_samples_stored](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#ae-max_samples_stored) events in a given minute reporting period and disregard the remainder for that minute. With the fix, the agent randomly samples those events across the reporting period.
