## New features and improvements

* Support Java 19 [1022](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1022)
* Support Play 2.8.16+ [981](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/981)
* Support ojdbc8 v21.1.0.0+ [1042](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1042)
* Support Semeru/OpenJ9 JVMs [993](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/993)
* Support log forwarding for java.util.logging (JUL) [1049](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1049)

* Support forwarding log context data [866](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/866)

    The agent can now forward data in Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC, logback/slf4j) and ThreadContext (log4j2) as attributes when forwarding log records. When the feature is enabled, these attributes will be added to the log records with a `context.` prefix. For details on how to enable this feature see the documentation for [context_data](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#logging-context-data).


* Custom Event Limit Increase  [1036](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1036)

    This version increases the default limit of custom events from 10,000 events per minute to 30,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable maximum limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, see the documentation for [max_samples_stored](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Custom_Events). To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see our Explorers Hub [post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/send-more-custom-events-with-the-latest-apm-agents/190497).


* Code-level metrics on by default [1037](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1037)

    The code-level metrics functionality introduced with agent 7.10 is now enabled by default. This feature will cause an increase in the consumption of data. The amount depends on the application. To disable code-level metrics, see instructions on our [code-level metrics documentation](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#code-level-metrics).


## Fixes
* Prevent an exception from being thrown in the Jedis instrumentation [1011](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1011)
* Improvement on Http4s transactions [1006](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1006)
* Fix noticeError API not verifying whether errors were expected [1014](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1014)
* Adds command for Lettuce queries to clusters [1031](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1031)
* Fix exception when building up the agent jar from a clean repo [1048](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1048)
* Better error handling for code-level metrics [1021](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1021) [1051](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1051)
* Fix HttpUrlConnection spans not terminating on exception [1053](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1053)

## Support statement

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).


## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       include_context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138
>
128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you are moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.
