### Notes

* Fix: Agent did not run with J2SE 5.0 (aka JDK 1.5)

  Release 2.21.0 - 2.21.2 did not run correctly on J2SE 5.0. On startup, the agent reports:

  ```
  Unable to start New Relic agent: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in .class file
  ```

  If you are running J2SE 5.0, please update to agent version 2.21.3.
