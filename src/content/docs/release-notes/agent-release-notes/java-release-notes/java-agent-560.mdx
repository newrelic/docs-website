### New APIs

* Added [getTraceMetadata()](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/Agent.html#getTraceMetadata()). This provides information about the currently executing trace, including the trace and span ids as well as it’s sampled state
* [getTraceId()](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/TraceMetadata.html), which provides the currently executing trace’s identifier from the `TraceMetadata`.
* [getSpanId()](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/TraceMetadata.html), which provides the span identifier associated with the currently executing span from the `TraceMetadata`.
* [isSampled()](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/TraceMetadata.html), returns whether or not the current transaction is part of a sampled distributed trace from the `TraceMetadata`.
* Added [getLinkingMetadata()](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/Agent.html#getLinkingMetadata()), which provides an opaque map of key/value pairs that can be used to correlate this application in the New Relic backend.

### Fixes

* Spring Webflux WebClient would not track external calls when constructed with `baseUrl(String baseUrl)`
* The `NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig().getValue()` api would not check configuration values set via environment variables
* The agent’s completable-future instrumentation could hold a reference to `Token`s after they were expired, which could cause excessive memory usage.
* Error traces could report to the wrong application when `auto_app_naming` is enabled and there were errors from two different application names getting reported during the same harvest
* The agent’s MongoDB instrumentation would instrument the same builder used by the async and reactive-streams drivers, resulting in excessive memory usage and incorrect transaction times. **Note:** The agent will no longer instrument the sync MongoDB driver if the async and/or reactive-streams drivers are on the application’s `classpath`.
