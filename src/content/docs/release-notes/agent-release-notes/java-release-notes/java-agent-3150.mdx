### Improvements:

* Labels and Rollups

The New Relic Java agent now supports the ability to apply labels to applications, so that you can easily sort, filter, and page through all of the applications on your account's Applications list.

Configuration can be done in the newrelic.yml file:

```
labels: Server:One;Data Center:Primary
```

More information on using labels to categorize your applications can be found in the [New Relic APM documentation](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).

* With this version of the Java Agent, you can update Custom instrumentation XML in the extensions folder and it will be reloaded within a minute.

### Fixes:

* Prior to this version, some thread profiles would time out and not display. Thread profiles will now complete reliably.
* The Java Agent now works around [IBM JVM bug IV25688](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV25688). The agent will scale back a small amount of its instrumentation on old IBM JVMs to avoid inducing the bug. The workaround should leave most customers unaffected. Loss of instrumentation caused by the workaround can be fixed by upgrading the JVM to the latest service release.
