## New features and improvements

- Support for CRaC [2250](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2250)
- Support for JDK24 [2284](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2284)
- Added sampling options when an inbound traceparent exists [2279](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2279)
	- These options define how the agent should handle sampling of spans, depending on sampling decisions that were made for their parent span by an upstream entity. The configuration options `remote_parent_sampled` and `remote_parent_not_sampled` specify what to do in the case the parent span was sampled or not sampled, respectively. See the [documentation](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#dt-sampler-remote-parent-sampled) for full configuration details.
- Support for Undertow as a stand-alone module [2269](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2269)
  - This instrumentation is disabled by default to avoid conflicts with existing Wildfly instrumentation. To enable this instrumentation for stand-alone Undertow server apps, use the configuration setting:

  ```yaml
   class_transformer:
     com.newrelic.instrumentation.undertow-server-1.1.0:
       enabled: true
  ```

- Support for Couchbase Client [2203](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2303)
 	- If the [Couchbase Client Experimental Module](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-java-couchbase) is currently in use, remove it from your extensions directory before upgrading to this version of the Java Agent.

## Fixes

- ~Fix netty 'Unknown' transactions [2274](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2274)~
 	- ~This fix moves previous netty instrumentation changes behind a feature flag, which provides additional visibility in some cases involving HTTP2 transactions. To reenable this granularity (at the possible cost of seeing ‘Unknown’ transactions), use the config setting~:

  ```yaml
    netty:
      http2:
        frame_read_listener:
          start_transaction: true
  ```

- Refactor AWS docker id fetch to use 5s timeout [2275](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2275)
- Feature flag to apply Kotlin `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` fix to all methods [2307](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2307 )
	- This fix addresses errors that may be seen when running the Java Agent in an environment where Kotlin suspends functions are used. To use this fix, set the system property `-Dnewrelic.config.class_transformer.clear_return_stacks=true`
- Prevent cache lock for long DB statement parsing [2294](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2294)
- Add config to specify whether java.sql is loaded by platform classloader [2267](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/2267)

## Deprecations

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `netty-3.4`
- `Struts v1`

<Callout variant="caution">
**Known issues**: This release has a known issue with Netty where 'Unknown' transactions persist, please update to a later version.
</Callout>

## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes).
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```yaml
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138
>
128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you're moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.

## Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
