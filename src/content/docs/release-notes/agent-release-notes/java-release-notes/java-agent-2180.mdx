### Notes

* New metrics are displayed under the JVM tab

  While the metrics displayed differ between application servers, common metrics include loaded class count, active thread count, active thread count per thread pool, active session count per application, and active transaction count. In order to see these metrics, JMX must be enabled on your app server.
* Fix: When naming transactions, the property `enable_auto_transaction_naming` should be honored

  There was an issue where transactions using the Spring Framework were ignoring the property.
* Fix: Strip query string from HTTP Referer

  Query strings can potentially contain sensitive information. To prevent that data from being sent to New Relic, only the host and path portion of the referer are captured.
