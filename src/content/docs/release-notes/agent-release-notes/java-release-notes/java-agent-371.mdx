### Notes

* Fix: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse API call was not backward-compatible

  Implementation classes of the com.newrelic.api.agent.Request and com.newrelic.api.agent.Response interfaces compiled with a pre-3.5.0 version of newrelic-api.jar threw a java.lang.AbstractMethodError when used with a 3.5.0 or higher version of the Agent.
* Fix: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse can cause LinkageError

  For some app servers, calling NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse API caused a java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation
* Fix: ignoreTransaction attribute ignored

  The ignoreTransaction="true" attribute in custom xml had no effect. The transaction was not ignored even with "true" set.
* Fix: In rare cases, Auto-RUM failed to add the New Relic header script to JSP pages.
* Fix: Naming of CGLib classes

  Improved the fix in 3.7.0 for excluding the random part from the name of CGLib generated class.
* Fix: Agent works properly inside a folder with + in the path

  Improved the fix in 3.7.0 for a directory path with a + character.
