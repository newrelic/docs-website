### Improvements

* Spring Web Services
  * The Java Agent now supports Spring Web Services. Transactions are named based on the SOAP method name. The agent also reports the SOAP version, content type, and SOAP Action.
* Support for Auto-RUM and precompiled JSPs
  * The Java agent now provides auto rum support when precompiling JSPs. To use auto rum when precompiling JSP files, add the agent as a java agent to your pre-compilation process.

### Fixes

* Fix: Under some circumstances the agent would report a LinkageError
* Fix: Grails 2 transaction names had extra slash
* Fix for auto-RUM
  * In some cases when a script tag is before a head tag in a JSP file, the auto RUM instrumentation was failing to place the initial New Relic header script in the page.
* Fix: Reduce overhead of Akka instrumentation when not used in conjunction with Play/Netty
* Fix: RabbitMQ instrumentation reported unnecessary transactions
  * basicPublish, basicGet, and nextDelivery no longer start short-lived  transactions.
