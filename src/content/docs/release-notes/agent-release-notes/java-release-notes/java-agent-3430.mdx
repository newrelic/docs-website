### Improvements

* Java 9

  The Java agent can now be run with [Oracle Java SE 9](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent#jvm)! You can run your applications on the Java 9 runtime JVM, and run applications compiled at the Java 9 language level.

  By default, this release of New Relic's Java agent does not support applications configured for the new Java 9 modular mode, such as Jigsaw. In order to run in this mode with the agent, your application must be configured to require the `java.sql` module through one of these two options:

  * Add `requires java.sql;` to your `module-info.java` class
  * Use the `--add-modules=java.sql` command line flag
