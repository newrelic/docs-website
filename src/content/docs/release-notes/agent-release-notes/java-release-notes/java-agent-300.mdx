### Notes

* Spring AOP instrumentation

  This version instruments any call that passes through an AOP pointcut that you have declared in your Spring application. This gives your additional insight into the call time of key Spring beans.
* Performance Improvements

  This version contains optimizations that reduce agent overhead.
* Fixes: Hibernate improvements

  In this version, we provide more consistent detail into Hibernate calls across supported version of Hibernate (3.3 - 4.2).
* Fix: Removed need for WebSphere SSL work-around

  Previous versions sometimes required a work-around when using WebSphere. This version removes the need for a work-around.
* NOTE: Requires Java SE 6 or 7

  Java Agent 3.0 requires Java SE 6 or 7. At signup or on the [release notes page](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes), you have the option to download a version of the agent that works with Java SE 5.
