### Improvements

* DynamoDB
  The Java agent now provides visibility into your applicationsâ€™ usage of DynamoDB when using the client versions 1.11.106 and greater. You will see the calls in the application breakdown, in trace details, on the Databases page, in Transaction maps, and in Service maps.
* Solr
  With this release, the java agent now supports Solr versions 6.5.0+.

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an instrumentation gap that prevented agent from capturing instance-level information about database queries for non-blocking IO driver configurations.
* Fixes an issue where usage onCompleted handler(s) with the ning async http client could cause a transaction to end too early, resulting in missed instrumentation.
