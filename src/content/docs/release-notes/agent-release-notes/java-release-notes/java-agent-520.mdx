### Improvements

* MongoDB

  This release adds instrumentation for mongo-java-driver clients created using the [MongoClients class](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html) Previous versions of the agent only supported the [MongoClient() constructor](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/MongoClient.html) Note: The MongoDB Asynchronous Java Drivers are not yet supported.
* Custom request header attributes

  The Java agent now provides a new configuration option to report HTTP request header(s) as [transaction attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes). See [the documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#tt-custom-request-headers) for more details.
* Distributed tracing

  Datastore [span events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/span-event) now include a db.collection attribute. This field represents the collection or primary table name for the associated query. It is accessible in Insights, Distributed Tracing, and anywhere you get your favorite spans.
* GC Time

  The Java agent now records time spent waiting for garbage collection during the duration of a transaction and includes the GC time on the corresponding transaction trace as well as the transactions time chart.

  This setting is configurable as follows in the newrelic.yml:

```
transaction_tracer:
    gc_time_enabled: true
```

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where very long-running transactions with a large number of [segments](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#segments) would cause an excessive amount of memory usage. The agent will no longer trace segments once the [segment_limit](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-tt-segment_limit) has been reached.

### Notes

* The Java agent now enforces a maximum of 10,000 [transaction events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#ae-max_samples_stored) per minute.
