### New features

* [Adds support for Akka Http Core 10.2.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/90). Thank you [jobicarter](https://github.com/jobicarter) for reporting this issue.
* [Adds support for gRPC 1.30.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/92). Thank you [jef](https://github.com/jef) for submitting this request and trying it out.
* [Adds support for `map` and `flatmap` async external calls in spring webflux framework](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/93). Previously the agent didn’t support client calls that occurred within the `map` or `flatmap` methods within the spring webflux framework. External calls such as `serviceB` and `serviceC` in the example below would not get reported to New Relic:

```
return serviceA.getData()
                .map(service -> Response.builder().service(service).build())
                .flatMap(serviceB::getData)
                .flatMap(serviceC::getData)
                .doOnNext(this::saveResponse);
```

* [Adds support for Play 2.16.3](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/97). Many thanks to [junder31](https://github.com/junder31) for this contribution.

### Improvements

* [The agent now supports parsing cgroup ids that do not contain `docker-`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/87). Previously, the agent only supported docker cgroup ids that contained `docker-` in them, such as `1:cpu:/system.slice/docker-12345abcde.scope`. The agent now supports parsing cgroup ids such as `1:cpu:/system.slice/crio-12345abcde.scope`.

### Fixes

* [Prevents the agent from logging a timeout exception when using New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing but the agent hasn’t sent spans in a while](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/76).
* [Prevents the agent from logging a socket exception when trying to retrieve cloud provider information in a non-cloud environment](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/80).
* [Adds New Relic EU certifications](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/89) if [`ca_bundle_path` is specified](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/configuring-your-ssl-certificates). This fix also came with the reintroduction of the `use_private_ssl` config, which can be set to add our agent certs to the truststore.

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
