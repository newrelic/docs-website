### Improvements

* Websphere Liberty Profile

  The Java agent now [provides instrumentation for WebSphere Liberty Profile](/docs/agents/java-agent/frameworks/websphere-liberty-profile-installation-java). This includes web transaction visibility, Cross Application Tracing, and app server stats.
* Performance improvements

  The Java agent now starts more quickly so applications are available sooner. This release also reduces agent overhead at run time.
* Customize hostname displayed in APM

  A new configuration setting has been added: [process_host.display_name](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#display_name). When set in the **newrelic.yml** configuration file, the display name [identifies the host in the APM UI](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/add-rename-remove-hosts#display_name), along with the hostname that the agent automatically captures.

  ```
  process_host:
      display_name: hostname
  ```

  In addition, the display name can be set using the `NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME` environment variable. This property can be viewed in all Insights transaction events.
* WebLogic and WebSphere instance name available

  The instance name for WebLogic and WebSphere application servers is now available in transaction traces, traced errors, and Insights transaction events.
* Custom instrumentation of transaction attributes is disabled by default

  Custom attributes defined using the **Instrumentation** tab in the UI are now disabled by default. In order to enable these attributes, you must have High-security mode disabled and you must place the following text in the `common:` block of your **newrelic.yml**:

  ```
  reinstrument:
      attributes_enabled: true
  ```

### Fixes

* Very large thread profiles were failing to report to RPM, causing the site to display a time out message. The agent will now truncate the size of the profile before sending.
* Cross application tracing date was failing to report when using Jersey 2 endpoints.
* Spring AOP instrumentation is now disabled by default. It was exercising a bug in certain versions of Java 8 that caused the JVM to crash. To re-enable, include the following in your **newrelic.yml**:

  ```
  com.newrelic.instrumentation.spring-aop-2:
         enabled: true
  ```
* RabbitMQ metrics could double-report for some versions of RabbitMQ. This was introduced in Java agent version 3.16.1 and is fixed in this version.
* In rare cases the agent would report a LinkageError.
