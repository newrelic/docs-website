### Notes

* JMS Messaging

  New Relic now gives you insight into the performance of your JMS message processing, both incoming and outgoing messages.

  New Relic now shows transactions initiated via JMS 1.1 message receipt. These transactions show up in the New Relic UI as background tasks of type "Message". In addition, JMS 1.1 message creation is shown in transaction traces.
* Grails 1.3.7 to 2.3.x

  New Relic now provides first-class visibility into your Grails applications. Grails web transactions are now named based on the Grails controller. The transactions track the details of your calls to JDBC, Hibernate, and other important frameworks, and provides full access to the New Relic Java agent API from Groovy. Grails installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/grails-installation-for-java)
* Updated instrumentation for supported app servers

  New Relic has updated the instrumentation of the application servers we support. In the process, we have updated the list of app servers that we instrument. For a current list of supported app server versions, see [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/new-relic-for-java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/new-relic-for-java)
* Fix: New Relic did not instrument Apache HttpClient 4.3

  Previous versions of the agent did not instrument HttpClient 4.3.x. That version is now properly supported.
* Fix: Java Agent failed on Weblogic with a certicate exception

  In some cases running Weblogic, the Java Agent would fail certificate validation when connecting to New Relic. That bug has been fixed.
* Fix: Java Agent suppressed application logging

  In version 3.2.3, the Java agent sometimes suppressed application logging. That bug has been fixed in this version.
* Fix: Java Agent was logging error messages regarding "weaved classes"

  In version 3.2, the Java agent wrote innocuous error messages to its log similar to the following:

  ERROR: javax/servlet/ServletOutputStream is marked as a weaved class, but no methods are matched to be weaved.

  That bug has been fixed in this version.
* Fix: Text instructions in the sample newrelic.yml file were improved

  If you are upgrading from a previous version of the agent, consider applying your configuration to this new version of the yml file.
