### Notes

* Fix: In some cases, Play 2.2 didn't report transactions

  When a chain of promises resolved, specifically using Future.flatMap(), lingering promises prevented the transaction from completing, in which case the transaction wouldn't be reported for the app. This is now tracked correctly.
* Fix: Improved performance when instrumented code is not running in a transaction

  Avoids unnecessary work when code instrumented by the Java agent is not running in the scope of a transaction.
