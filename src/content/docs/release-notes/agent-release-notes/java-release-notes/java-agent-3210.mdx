### Improvements

* Advanced Analytics for APM Errors

  With this release, the agent reports [TransactionError](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/error-event-default-attributes-insights) events. These new events power the beta feature [Advanced Analytics for APM Errors](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-errors-error-traces) (apply [here <Icon name="fe-external-link"/>](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/join-the-apm-errors-beta-of-real-time-analytics/31123) to participate). The error events are also available today through [New Relic Insights <Icon name="fe-external-link"/>](http://newrelic.com/insights) .

  Advanced Analytics for APM Errors lets you see all of your errors, with granular detail. Filter and group by any attribute to analyze them. Take action to resolve issues through collaboration.

### Fixes

* Fixed a memory leak in async continuations instrumentation for Jetty 7 and 8.
* Improved error handling with invalid JMX **.yml** extension files.
* Improved [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/circuit-breaker-java-custom-instrumentation) logging in the event of a Circuit Breaker trip.
* Fixed a bug in Tomcat 7+ instrumentation where request parameters could occasionally get stripped when using an async servlet with `capture_params` set to `true`.

### Notes

The Java Agent now collects the following information for web transactions:

* Accept, Host, User-Agent, Content-Length HTTP request headers
* HTTP request method, for example POST or GET
* Content-Type HTTP response header

### Known issues

* Fixed in 3.25.0:
  * Setting enable_custom_tracing configuration flag to false can inadvertently disable Netty instrumentation.
  * In some cases JAX-RS annotations on interfaces are not observed, causing transactions using JAX-RS services to be named on the servlet rather than the web servicepath and method.
* Fixed in 3.24.1:
  * The Java agent's Play 2 transaction tracing instrumentation may be incomplete and cause gaps in cross application tracing.
* Fixed in 3.24.0:
  * The Java agent's EJB instrumentation may cause a StackOverflowException to appear in application logs.
  * Applications may continue to experience the additional Circuit Breaker overhead even when disabled.
  * The Java agent may experience increased overhead when using Cross Application Tracing and a large number of threads.
* Fixed in 3.23.0
  * This release may experience a memory leak within the agent for Tomcat containing a large number of static JSPs (5000+).
  * When a transaction makes multiple calls to a database with the same obfuscated SQL, a NullPointerException is may get thrown in the agent.
  * This release contains a bug in New Relic's Cross Application Tracing (CAT) that can cause incorrect service and transaction maps.

The problem happens when non-identical applications, with identical transaction names, would appear to be communicating (in the Transaction / Service maps), when in fact, they were not.

<Callout variant="important">
  Using a combination of pre-3.23.0 and 3.23.0+ can result in external calls between the old and new agents to not show up in the map. To fix this, upgrade all of your agents to 3.23.0+ at the same time.
