### Notes

* * *

* Fix: Fixed bug in which application code can throw NoSuchMethodError

  In some cases using Java agent 2.17.0 and 2.17.1, application code was throwing an exception

  `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.Boolean.valueOf(B)Ljava/lang/Byte;`

  This usually occurred when calling a ResultSet implementation.
