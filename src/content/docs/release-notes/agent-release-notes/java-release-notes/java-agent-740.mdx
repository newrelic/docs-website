### New features and improvements

* Support for Java 17 [#433](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/433)

* Distributed tracing is on by default and deprecates cross-application tracing [#486](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/486)

  * Increases the default maximum number of samples stored for span events from 1000 to 2000.
  * The maximum number of samples stored for span events can be configured via the max_samples_stored configuration in the newrelic.yml.

  ```
  span_events:
    max_samples_stored: 2000
  ```

  <Callout variant="important">
    This feature causes an increase in the consumption of data. The amount of increase will depend on the application. This feature can be disabled by adding the following to the agent yaml config nested under the common section:

    ```
    distributed_tracing:
      enabled: false
    ```
  </Callout>

* Auto-instrumentation support for GraphQL-Java 17.0+ [#487](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/487)

* This version tested agent support for the ARM64/Graviton2 platform

### Fixes

The existing MongoDB sync client instrumentation was incorrectly applying when MongoDB reactive or async client was being used, which could lead to segment timeouts and long transaction response times. [#476](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/476)

### Deprecations and removed features

Cross application tracing is now deprecated, and disabled by default. To continue using it, enable it with `cross_application_tracer.enabled = true` and `distributed_tracing.enabled = false`.

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
