### Notes

* Agent reports JDBC ResultSet query time

  This change gives you deeper insight into your database time by displaying ResultSet processing time in aggregate metrics and transaction traces.
* Fix: Avoid retransform exception on IBM JREs

  In some IBM JRE versions, the agent logged an INFO level exception and did not instrument select classes. This fix allows these classes to be instrumented properly.
* Adds a stack trace in a transaction trace for all methods taking longer than stack trace threshold. This differs from 2.16 which only provided stack traces for a limited number of methods.
* Better transaction naming on ColdFusion
