### Notes

* Fix: Issue at startup with JBoss and Glassfish

  An issue in the 3.0.0 version caused startup of some versions of JBoss and Glassfish to fail. This version fixes that issue.
* Fix: RUM not auto-instrumented for JSPs

  The Java Agent should auto-instrument RUM header and footer in JSPs when using the Jasper engine. This did not work in 3.0.0. This version fixes that issue.
