### Notes

* Fix: Longer application startup time

  Release 2.21.0 introduced an issue that could cause application startup to be slower than in previously releases. This fix returns application startup time to normal.
* Fix: File location changes

  Release 2.21.0 introduced a change to file locations within the newrelic zip file. This fix reverts the locations to what they were previously.
