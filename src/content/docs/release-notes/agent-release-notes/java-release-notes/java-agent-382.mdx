* Fixed: Instrumentation missing including browser monitoring

  There was a bug in the agent that caused several instrumentation modules to not be loaded. This bug occurred when no extensions directory existed or the extensions directory was empty. This fix will allow auto-RUM to report normally. This bug was introduced in 3.8.0.
* Fix: Missing metrics with Java 2 Security

  When Java 2 Security was enabled, the agent failed to report some metrics. This bug was introduced in 3.8.0.
* Fix: Agent could stop reporting transactions

  For Jetty applications, the agent could stop reporting transactions if an uncaught exception was thrown. This bug was introduced in 3.6.0.
* Fix: Agent not reporting external services in Play 2.3

  The Java Agent was not reporting calls to external services.
