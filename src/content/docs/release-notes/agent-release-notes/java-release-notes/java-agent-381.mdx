### Notes

* Fix: EJB application transaction metrics reporting correctly for WebLogic

  In version 3.8.0 of the agent, EJB application transaction metrics for WebLogic were reporting the data as the average value per a bean instead of the total value per an application. This has been fixed and the data can now be found under the JVM tab.
* Fix: App Map incomplete

  If a web request made an external call to another app, the app making the web request did not appear in the App Map. Moreover, subsequent external calls to other apps did not appear in the App Map either.
