### Improvements

**gRPC**

The Java agent now supports gRPC. You will now see [transactions](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems), [errors](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors), [external calls](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page), and [distributed traces](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) for all of your gRPC-based clients and services.

**Vert.x-3.7**

The Java agent now supports Vert.x 3.7. The agent instruments Vert.x Web, Vert.x Core, and Vert.x HTTP client. With this instrumentation, the agent will identify and name your [transactions](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems) based on Vert.x web routing paths. The agent will also time web handlers, track async handlers, and [external calls](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page) made with Vert.x HTTP client.

**OkHttp 3.14.0**

This release adds support for OkHttp 3.14.x. You will now see OkHttp 3.14 calls as [external calls](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page) in New Relic.

**spray-can**

The Java agent now supports the spray-can client. The agent will now capture outbound http calls made with the spray-can client and report them as [external calls](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page) and/or [distributed traces](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing).

**Embedded Derby 10.15.1.3**

The Java agent has expanded support for Derby JDBC up to and including version 10.15.1.3.

**JVM monitoring**

The Java agent now reports JMX stats for off-heap direct byte buffers. These metrics are available via the [JVM page](/docs/agents/java-agent/features/jvm-metrics-page)

**recordCustomEvent API**

The recordCustomEvent API has been updated to accept Map&lt;String,?> as a second parameter instead of Map&lt;String,Object>, allowing maps such as Map&lt;String,String> to be passed without having to cast the type of the map's value.

### Fixes

* The agent no longer requires a newrelic.yml even when the `app_name` and `license_key` configuration options are set via environment variables and/or system properties. For more information, see the [Java environment variables documentation](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Environment_Variables).
* HttpSessions JMX metrics were not reporting for Websphere Liberty Profile applications.
* The `transaction_events.max_samples_stored` configuration value in the `newrelic.yml` would incorrectly override the system properties or environment variable values.
* Applications running on WildFly 12 - 15 would fail start with `NoClassDefFound` errors for Java agent classes.
* Play applications where external calls inside of future callbacks using `async-http-client` would not be recorded.
* Setting `log_limit_in_kbytes` would result in the agent not logging to the agent log file if `log_file_count` was also set to less than 2.
* Webflux status codes which were not recognized by Spring Webflux caused a 500 status code to be returned and an exception in application logs.

### Known Issues

**gRPC: Fixed in 5.1.1**

This release contains two bugs in the Java agent's gRPC instrumentation. We highly recommend customers using gRPC instrumentation to upgrade to this and/or later agent versions.

* References to transaction segments were not being removed correctly, which can cause a memory leak.
* The agent could cause the gRPC server listeners to fail to execute its `completed` and/or `cancelled` methods, which can cause unexpected behavior.

### Deprecation Notes

**Self installer**

The New Relic Java agent's self-installer has been removed in order to provide a more consistent user experience. To install the Java agent, add the full path to the `newrelic.jar` to the `-javaagent` flag in your JVM options. For more information on installing the agent on specific [application servers](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument), [Docker](/docs/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/install-new-relic-java-agent-docker), [Maven](/docs/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/maven-installation-java), or [Gradle](/docs/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/install-java-agent-using-gradle), see the [JVM argument documentation](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument).

**Deprecated instrumentation**

The following instrumentation modules have been moved out of the default Java agent, and are now provided as a [separate download](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/additional-instrumentation-modules-java-agent). To continue using these modules, just add them to the agent's [extensions directory](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#extensions-directory) in your `newrelic` folder or wherever your [extensions directory is configured](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-extensions-dir).
