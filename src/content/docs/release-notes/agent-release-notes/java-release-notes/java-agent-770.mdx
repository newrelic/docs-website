### New features and improvements

* Supports Java 18 [813](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/813)
* APM logs in context. Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about this feature see [Java: Configure logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/java-configure-logs-context-all), and additional configuration options are available [Java agent configuration: Config file](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Logs-in-Context). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account see [Disable automatic logging](/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging) [817](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/817)
* Added instrumentation support for the Postgres, MySQL, Oracle & MSSQL R2DBC connectors [810](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/810), [816](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/816), [829](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/829), and [828](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/828)
