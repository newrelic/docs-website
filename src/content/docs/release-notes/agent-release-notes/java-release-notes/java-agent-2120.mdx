### Notes

* Agent reports jars used by applications to the Environments tab in the UI

  The Environments tab in the New Relic UI now shows the jars used by your application.
* Fix: In certain cases, auto-RUM of JSP breaks HTML

  An angle-bracket in quotes in a META tag causes the agent to produce invalid HTML for JSP. The fix produces valid HTML for this case.
* Fix: Key Transaction ApdexT value not used

  In v2.10 - v2.11, the application-level ApdexT value is used for Key Transactions rather than the ApdexT for the Key Transaction itself. In this release, the ApdexT for the Key Transaction is used.
* Fix: With OC4J using PolicyClassLoader, no metrics displayed

  In the case where OC4J uses the PolicyClassLoader, the agent generates a java.lang.StackOverflowError in the log and does not provide metrics. In this release, the error does not occur.
* Fix: External metrics for HttpClient include port if host is an IP address

  In the case where an external service call uses HttpClient with an IP address rather than a hostname, the port number is also included. In this release, the port number is not displayed.
