### New features and improvements

* Support for [Java 16](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/366)

* Auto-instrumentation support for [java.net.http.HttpClient](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/251)

* Migrate the Agent’s caching library from Guava to [Caffeine](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/295) (Special thanks to community member [Stephan Schroevers](https://github.com/Stephan202) for this contribution)
  * [Caffeine provides an in-memory cache](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine#cache) using a Google Guava inspired API. The improvements draw on the author’s experience designing Guava's cache and `ConcurrentLinkedHashMap`.
  * We expect this change to provide improvement in cases where we saw thread contention and deadlocks attributable to the Guava library.

### Fixes

* Removed support for the [anorm-2.0 instrumentation module](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/426)
  * The artifacts that this module instrumented are no longer available.

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
