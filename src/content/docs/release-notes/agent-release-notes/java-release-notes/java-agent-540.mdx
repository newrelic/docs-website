* Jax-RS instrumentation was not starting transactions.
* A potential race condition during agent startup that would manifest as a NoClassDefFoundError for internal New Relic classes.
* Akka-http instrumentation would attempt multiple retransforms of the same class.
* The noticeError API would drop custom attributes that weren't of type String, Number, or Boolean, such as an Enum or other custom types.
