### Improvements

* Spring Webflux

* Scala 2.13
  * The Java agent now provides support for Scala 2.13 and frameworks compiled with 2.13 Akka-http, Play

### Fixes

* The netty-4.0.8 instrumentation would sometimes not start a Transaction on channelRead, potentially affecting instrumentation dependent on it including: Spring, Akka and Play
* Updated the Java agent’s Apache HttpClient dependency to 5.13
* Spring Webclient could report the wrong URL when multiple HTTP calls to several URLs occurred in parallel
