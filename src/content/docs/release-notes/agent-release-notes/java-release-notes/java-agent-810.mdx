## New features and improvements

- Added support for Webflux 6 [1181](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1181)

- Added support for Spring JMS 6 [1088](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1088)

- Added support for Mongodb Reactive Streams [1164](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1164)

- Added support for Kafka Streams [1170](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1170)

  Support for Kafka Streams comes in two flavors, metrics and spans. Metrics are enabled by default, while spans are disabled by default. To enable spans add the following to your _newrelic.yml_ configuration under the common stanza:
```
common:
  class_transformer:
    kafka-streams-spans:
      enabled: true
```

- Error fingerprint - supply your own errors inbox group names [1195](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1195)

  Are your error occurrences grouped poorly? Set your own error fingerprint via a callback function. A new public API method has been added that will accept a user defined proc. The proc will be invoked for each noticed error and whenever it returns a string, that string will be used as the error group name for the error and will take precedence over any server-side grouping that takes place with the New Relic errors inbox. This gives users much greater control over the grouping of their errors. For more information check our [API: Error Grouping](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/api-guides/java-agent-api-register-error-group-callback-to-set-fingerprint/) and [APM: Group errors tab](/docs/errors-inbox/apm-tab/) pages.

- User tracking - associate errors with a user id [1188](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1188)

  You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group. Identify the end user with a new public API method that will accept a string representation of a user id and associate that user id with the current transaction. Transactions and errors will then have a new `enduser.id` agent attribute associated with them. This will allow agent users to tag transactions and errors as belonging to given user ids in support of greater filtering and alerting capabilities. For more information check the [Newrelic.setUserId ](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/NewRelic.html#setUserName(java.lang.String) documentation and the [Track users impacted with errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/error-users-impacted/) page.

- Invoking `token.link()` outside a transaction will instrument that method to start an async transaction [1140](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1140)

- The Kafka clients instrumentation has new metrics to list the nodes: `MessageBroker/Kafka/Nodes/&lt;node>` [1130](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1130)

- Fix WeavedMethod and InstrumentedMethod annotations when applied to constructors.  [1153](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1153)
- Performance improvements when using Tomcat [1131](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1131)
- Fixed a bug that caused the agent to not report some exceptions [1176](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1176)
- Updated DockerData to increase the number of container IDs detected [1178](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1178)

## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       include_context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138
>
128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you are moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.

## Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
