### New features and improvements

* Update to jfr-daemon 1.7.0 - fixes a memory leak condition by cleaning up copies of JFR recordings. Also updated to use version 0.13.1 of the telemetry-sdk [638](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/638)
* Update HTTP response code attribute names. This will add `http.statusCode` and `http.statusText` to spans and transactions [513](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/513)
* Provide support for Datastax/Cassandra WrappedStatments. [525](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/525)
* Add instrumentation for gRPC 1.40.0+ [518](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/518)
* Add suppressed exceptions to ThrowableError.stackTrace [405](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/405)
* Add Scala instrumentation and Scala API for Monix Tasks [543](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/543)
* Add instrumentation for Mongo async/reactivestreams drivers versions 3.4.x to 4.1.x [609](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/609)
* Scala Cats Effect 3 - modified the API to support passing the transaction by implicit reference, rather than using ThreadLocal variables [578](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/578)
* Add Instrumentation for Play WS 2.6.0 under Scala 2.13 [594](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/594)
* Agent optimization: change String.replaceAll in favor of Pattern.compile [592](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/592)

### Fixes

* Upgrade log4j-core version to 2.17.1 to address security vulnerability [CVE-2021-44832](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44832) [625](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/625)
* Enhancements for Spring WebFlux and Reactor Netty instrumentation to address gaps in instrumentation. Also includes support for upgraded Spring Security configurations [538](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/538)
* Update Async-Http-Client library version to 2.0.35 to address security vulnerability [CVE-2017-14063](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14063)  [577](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/577)
* Handle null pointer exceptions in hostname lookup [587](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/587)
* Properly expire tokens used in CompletableFuture instrumentation to reduce memory usage and prevent telemetry reporting delays [634](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/634)
* Add additional exception handling to catch ConnectionPoolTimeoutException errors, which may lead to an unrecoverable agent state [637](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/637)
* Resolve Solr FilterCache Memory Leak [613](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/613)
