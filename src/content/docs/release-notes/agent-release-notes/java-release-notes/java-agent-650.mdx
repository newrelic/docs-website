### New features and improvements:

* The agent no longer bundles SSL certificates with it and the `use_private_ssl` option that configured the agent to use
  the previously bundled certificates has been removed. By default, the agent will use the SSL truststore provided by
  the JVM unless it is explicitly configured to use a different truststore with the ca_bundle_path option. See
  [Configuring your SSL certificates](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/configuring-your-ssl-certificates/)
  for more details.

### Fixes:

* Fixes an issue that could cause incorrect transaction naming when using JAX-RS sub-resources.
* Reactor Netty instrumentation improvements and fixes.

### Deprecation notice

* Java 7 compatibility deprecation

In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers who run on the JVM, Java 7
support has been deprecated and this will be the last version of the agent compatible with it.

If you are running Java 7, you may continue to use Java agent 6.5.0 or lower.

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
