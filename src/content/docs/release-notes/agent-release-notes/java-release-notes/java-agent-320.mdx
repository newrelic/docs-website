### Notes

* Glassfish 4 metrics for JVM Memory, Thread Pool, and Transactions

  New Relic now displays JVM memory, thread pool, and transaction metrics for Glassfish 4. To expose these metrics, please set http-service, transaction- service, and web-container monitoring within Glassfish to high. To see the metrics in New Relic, go to Monitoring > JVMs.
* Decreased agent overhead for Play 2

  This version of the agent reduces the overhead that it incurs on Play 2. Play 2 users should upgrade for improved performance.

  In addition to general overhead improvements, New Relic has introduced a new setting to reduce overhead even more for particularly low-latency applications. Note that this setting will make the call info in Trace Details more generic.

  ```
  transaction_tracer:
    stack_based_naming: false
  ```
* Manually disable auto RUM instrumentation for specific pages

  For supported JSP engines, New Relic automatically adds RUM (Real User Monitoring) elements to the response HTML. If you like auto-RUM, but do not want to apply it to all pages, you can now disable it for select pages. The configuration property disabled_auto_pages in the browser_monitoring section can now be used to disable auto RUM instrumentation for a comma delimited list of pages. For example,

  ```
  browser_monitoring:
    disabled_auto_pages: page1.jsp, page2.jsp
  ```
* akka.actor.ActorKilledException is now ignored by default

  The ActorKilledException is commonly thrown in Play applications as a control mechanism in normally functioning applications. In previous versions, this exception inflated the reported error rate. These exceptions are now ingored by default. You can override the default ignore_errors list to provide your own exceptions or to omit the ActorKilledException.

  ```
  error_collector:
    ignore_errors: some.other.MyException
  ```
* New Relic reports host capacity information

  New Relic now reports physical CPU cores, logical CPU cores (hyperthreads), and physical memory. On non-Linux platforms, the agent runs a subprocess to retrieve this information. To see the info in New Relic, go to Settings > Environment > Environment Snapshot.
* Report JVM name and revision to New Relic as part of JVM description

  Recording the JVM name in addition to the vendor allows differentiation between different JVMs from the same vendor. To see these values in New Relic, go to Settings > Environment > Environment Snapshot and look for the "Java VM" and "Java VM Version" settings.
* Fix: Support for Play 2.2

  Web transactions were not being correctly captured under some circumstances for Play 2.2 applications. Web transactions are now correctly reported. Also note the change in command line syntax as of Play 2.2: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/play-installation-for-java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/play-installation-for-java)
* Fix: Background tasks created by an @Trace annotation with a 'metricName' element did not show up in the New Relic UI.
