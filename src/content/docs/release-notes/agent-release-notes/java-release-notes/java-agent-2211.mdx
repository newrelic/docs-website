### Notes

* Fix: In 2.21.0, calls to NewRelic class can cause NoClassDefFoundError

  In 2.21.0, if your application calls the NewRelic class and does not include the newrelic-api.jar, the application would throw a NoClassDefFoundError. With this fix, the separate newrelic-api.jar is not required. However, it is recommended that your application include the newrelic-api.jar so that calls to the NewRelic API resolve with or without the agent installed.
