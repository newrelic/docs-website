### New features and improvements:

* [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/) is now fully integrated into the Java agent. See the [JFR core README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/blob/main/README.md) for additional details.

This feature requires a supported version of Java 8 (specifically version `8u262` or higher) or Java 11 or higher and is currently disabled by default. To enable it set the following in your yaml (indented 2 spaces under the common stanza).

```
jfr:
  enabled: true
```

**Notice:** If you were previously using the [jfr-daemon jar](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core) as an agent extension or standalone process you should remove that option to avoid potential conflicts with the JFR service that is now built into the agent.

* Not compatible with Java 7. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers who run on the JVM, this and future agent versions aren't compatible with Java 7. If you're running Java 7, you may continue to use Java agent 6.5.0 or lower. For details, see this topic on
  the [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-synthetics-apm-java-php-infrastructure-mobile-agents-health-maps-statsd-and-legacy-dashboards/147982).
* Adds support for akka http with Scala 2.13. [#271](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/271)
* Class annotation to trace lambda methods. [#274](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/274)
* Class annotation to trace methods by return type. [#275](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/275)

### Fixes:

* Fixes an issue that could cause multiple versions of `akka-http-core` instrumentation to apply at the
  same time. [#208](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/208)
* The agent will now log dropped events at `FINE` instead of `WARN` to decrease
  verbosity. [#296](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/296)
* Fixes Javadoc comments that incorrectly stated that, when calling the `noticeError` API multiple times,
  the first error would be reported when in fact it's the last error that is reported. [#313](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/313)

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

### Known Issues

* OkHttp

This release contains a bug that breaks OkHttp versions 3.X and below. All affected users should upgrade to 7.0.1.
