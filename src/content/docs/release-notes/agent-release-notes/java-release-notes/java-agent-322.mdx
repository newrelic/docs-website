### Notes

* Fix: Play 2.2 instrumentation in action methods

  In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent failed to instrument calls present in a controller's action method. This means database calls, external calls, and custom instrumented calls within the action method were not being reported to New Relic. This bug has been fixed.
* Fix: Invalid exclusive time errors with Play 2.2

  In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent sometimes reported error messages to the newrelic log indicating an "Invalid exclusive time". This error has been fixed.
* Fix: Inaccurate async wait time with Play 2.x

  In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent reported an async wait time for Play 2.x transactions that was too large. This bug has been fixed.
