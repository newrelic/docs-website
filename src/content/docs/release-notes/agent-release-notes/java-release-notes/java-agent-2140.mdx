### Notes

* Fix: New Relic includes property take_last_status to only grab the final http status code.

  By default, New Relic reports any error status code. However, when this property is set to true, only the last http status code will be reported. This property should be set when using Apache Felix.
* Fix: New Relic now correctly patches Apache Felix ClassLoaders.
* Fix: Time will now display correctly for the first hour of the day when using log4j.
* Fix: RUM header was missing a semicolon at the end of the last statement. Some browsers prefer semicolons everywhere.
* Adds a `X-NewRelic-ID` header to outbound requests using the Apache HttpClient or HttpURLConnection libraries. This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services in a service-oriented architecture for a forthcoming feature. In the meantime, if you wish to disable the header, set 'cross_application_tracing: false' in newrelic.yml.
* Fix: Java agent now reports hostnames consistent with the output of "hostname -s" to match all other agents
* Add report of physical server memory (in addition to JVM memory) on Unix/Linux machines
