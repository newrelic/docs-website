### Improvements

* The 'request.uri' attribute is now included in Transaction events and corresponding Transaction Error events. As a result this attribute can now be queried in New Relic. It may be excluded via the exclude list in the [attributes stanza of the yaml config file](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/attributes/enabling-disabling-attributes-java). It is also excluded when High Security Mode is enabled.
* Distributed Tracing can now be enabled at the same time as [auto app naming](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/automatic-application-naming). Each application created by this setting will share an event reservoir for Distributed Tracing.
* Updates Akka HTTP instrumentation to support the newest version of Akka HTTP, 10.1.5 and above.

### Fixes

* Fixes a possible NullPointerException that could occur in Hystrix instrumentation and propagate into application code.
* Fixes a bug where usage of the HttpsURLConnection getInputStream() method could cause some scoped external metrics to be double-counted.
* Fixes an issue that prevents the agent from connecting to an HTTP proxy that does not requires a username or password.

  When configured to use an HTTP proxy by using proxy_host and proxy_port, the agent would look for proxy_username and proxy_password. If those weren't provided, the agent would use an empty string for proxy_username and proxy_password.
* Prevents unnecessary dependencies from showing up in the newrelic-agent pom
* Fixes deadlocks occurring in agent 4.7.0 that were caused by instrumentation of classes in the `sun/nio/cs/.*` package
* Fixes an issue where custom jmx metrics with '.'s in the attribute name would not get recorded.
