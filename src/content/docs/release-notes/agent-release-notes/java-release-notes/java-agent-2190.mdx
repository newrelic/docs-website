### Notes

* Play 2 Instrumentation

  Provides insight into Play 2.x Java and Scala applications. Adds instrumentation to Netty server, Akka actor calls, Scala Promises and Futures, and the WS API calls.

  Known issue: Request parameters are not captured properly even if `capture_params` is enabled.
* Support added for Jetty 9 (tested on 9.0.0 through Jetty 9.0.3).
* Fix: Agent can cause java.lang.VerifyError on code compiled with Java 7

  In certain cases, if your application code or third party libraries are compiled with Java 7, you may get a java.lang.VerifyError. This fix allows the agent to work correctly in those cases.
* Fix: The Java Agent detects status codes for Apache Felix correctly by default. The property take_last_status is now deprecated.
