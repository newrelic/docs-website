### New features

* **Support for Real Time Streaming**

  * Event data is now sent to New Relic every five seconds, instead of every minute. As a result, transaction, error, and custom events will now be available in New Relic dashboards in near real time. For more information on how to view your events with a five-second refresh, see the [real time streaming documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming).
  * Note that the overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute have not changed. Also, span events, metrics, and trace data is unaffected, and will still be sent every minute.

### Improvements

* The Java agent now uses persistent connections when connecting to New Relic, reducing overhead.
