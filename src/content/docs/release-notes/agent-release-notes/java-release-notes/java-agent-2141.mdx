### Notes

* Fix: Application errors using java.net.HttpURLConnection. The bug, introduced in 2.14.0, could cause errors in code that uses java.net.HttpURLConnection. Possible errors could occur in XML parsing, incorrect http response status, or BeanCreationException in Spring. As part of this fix the agent does not add a 'X-NewRelic-ID' header to outbound requests using java.net.HttpURLConnection.
