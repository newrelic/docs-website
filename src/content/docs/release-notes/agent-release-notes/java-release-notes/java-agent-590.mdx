### Improvements

* AWS SDK

  * AWS S3 - The Java agent now reports calls to Amazon S3 using AmazonS3 and S3Client as external metrics
  * AWS SQS - The Java agent now reports calls to Amazon SQS using AmazonSQS, AmazonSQSAsync, SqsClient as message queue metrics
  * AWS SNS - The Java agent now reports calls to Amazon SQS using AmazonSNS, AmazonSNSAsync, SnsClient as message queue metrics
* Distributed Tracing - The agent now supports [distributed traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) originating from the [New Relic Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser)

### Fixes

* The `ca_bundle_path` configuration setting would fail to correctly import certificates when running on IBM J9
* Clarified the startup log message about the state of browser monitoring for the current application.
* The agent logger would sometimes throw a NullPointerException
* The agent would stop reporting Kafka metrics when one or more clients where closed
* HttpURLConnection instrumentation could cause a NullPointerException in the agent logs and fail to report External metrics

### Deprecated

* Jar Collector system properties prefixed with `newrelic.config.module` and environment variables prefixed with `NEW_RELIC_MODULE` are deprecated and will be removed in a future agent release. Instead use the `newrelic.config.jar_collector` and `NEW_RELIC_JAR_COLLECTOR` prefixes.

### Removed dependency

* The agent no longer has a dependency on ANTLR.
