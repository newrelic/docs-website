### Improvements

* Removed the SSL configuration option: SSL is now always used in communication with New Relic servers. The `newrelic.yml` ssl configuration and `-Dnewrelic.config.ssl` system property are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than true will result in logging a warning.
* Minimum version required for use in EU datacenter.

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the [thread profiler](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/thread-profiler-tool) could fail to report. In this case, the agent logged a `java.lang.StackOverflowError`.
