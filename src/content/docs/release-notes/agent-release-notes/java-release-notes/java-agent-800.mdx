<Callout variant="important">
This release includes a change to the `HttpURLConnection` instrumentation that creates a `TimerTask` to help ensure complete externals reporting. Under some circumstances this may result in a large number of threads being created, which may exhaust the maximum allocated to the JVM, causing it to stop. This issue has been fixed in the 8.0.1 release and it is highly recommended that you update to this version of the Java agent.

## New features and improvements

- Added support for Slick 3.4.0 on Scala 2.13
- Added support for Embedded Tomcat JMX
- Updated the Java agent’s `snakeyaml` dependency to 1.33
- Added tracer debug logging, which will appear when `-Dnewrelic.config.log_level=finest` 
and `-Dnewrelic.debug=true` are set
- Improved logging when using the `recordCustomEvent` API now includes event type, key and value
- Added Log4j1 instrumentation to support auto log forwarding
- Added JBoss Logging instrumentation to support auto log forwarding
- [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/) can now be dynamically enabled/disabled via agent configuration

## Fixes

- Removed leading slash in JCache metric names
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Log4j2 metrics from getting disabled properly
- Added a missing delimiter in `POSTGRES_DIALECT_PATTERN`
- Fixed a `ClassCastException` in GraphQL 16/17
- Refactored `HttpURLConnection` instrumentation to fix several bugs that were affecting external calls and distributed traces
- Refactored `grpc-1.40.0` instrumentation to ensure that tokens were properly being linked across threads
- Fixed a bug that was causing transactions to fail to link when the Spring Webclient would timeout and emit a `ReadTimeoutException`

## Removals

The following previously deprecated instrumentation modules were removed:
- `cassandra-datastax-2.1.2`
- `httpclient-3.0`
- `jdbc-embedded-derby-10.2.1.6`
- `jdbc-embedded-derby-10.10.1.1`
- `jetty-7`
- `jetty-7.6`
- `jetty-9`
- `jetty-9.0.4`
- `jetty-9.1`
- `mongodb-2.12`
- `mongodb-2.14`
- `mongodb-3.0`
- `okhttp-3.0.0`
- `okhttp-3.4.0`
- `okhttp-3.5.0`

The previously deprecated `http.responseCode`, `response.status` and `response.statusMessage` transaction/span attributes were removed. These have been replaced by `http.statusCode` and `http.statusText`. If you have any custom dashboards or alerts that query the `http.responseCode`, `response.status`, and `response.statusMessage` attributes then they will need to be updated to instead use `http.statusCode` and `http.statusText`.

## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       include_context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138
>
128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you are moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.
