## New features and improvements

* Add HTTP/2 support for Netty 4.1.16.Final + [1815](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1815)
* Support external calls inside Spring Reactor call chains [1828](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1828)
* Support for Apache Pekko (i.e. the pekko-actor library). _Support for Pekko HTTP coming soon._ [1811](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1811)
* Add configuration to allow the OTel SDK integration to be completely disabled [1821](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1821)

  Configuration via yaml:

  ```
  opentelemetry:
    sdk:
      autoconfigure:
        enabled: false
  ```

  Configuration via system property:

  ```
    -Dnewrelic.config.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.enabled=false
  ```
* Treat OpenTelemetry [@WithSpan](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/automatic/annotations/#creating-spans-around-methods-with-withspan) annotation as [@Trace](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/api-guides/java-agent-api-instrument-using-annotation/#trace) in the Java Agent API  [1841](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1841)

## Fixes

* Fix high CPU usage with HttpURLConnection by reverting InboundWrapper changes introduced in 8.10.0 [1840](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1840)
* Prevent duplicate HTTP external calls when using the DynamoDB SDK [1827](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1827)

## Deprecations

* The browser footer injection APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future agent release. The header injection API now adds both the header and footer scripts. [1679](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1679)

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

* `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
* `java.completable-future-jdk8`
* `play-2.3`
* `spring-3.0.0`
* `netty-3.4`
* `Struts v1`

## IAST

### Changes

* Json Version bump to 1.2.0 [207](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/207)
* IAST replay header decryption due to Security Findings [207](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/207)

### Fixes

* Fix issue related to the instrumentation of the Rhino JavaScript Engine that occurred while reading the script [211](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/211)


* Changelog: [v8.10.0...v8.11.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/compare/v8.10.0...v8.11.0)

## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```yaml
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138
>
128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you are moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.

## Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
