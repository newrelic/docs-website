### Improvements

* APIs

  This release adds a [number of APIs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-agent-api-guide) that will allow you to instrument and get expanded visibility into frameworks, libraries, and any custom code that New Relic does not automatically instrument. In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from [messaging systems, database calls, and external calls](/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-api-overview-instrumenting-external-calls-cat-messaging-datastore-web-frameworks)! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relicâ€™s built-in instrumentation.
* Solr

  This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0).

### Fixes

* Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters.
* Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag `javac -parameters`. The issue would cause the application to throw a `java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException` exception.
* Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods.
* The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version.
* Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the `X-Queue-Start` or `X-Request-Start` HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents.
* Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.
