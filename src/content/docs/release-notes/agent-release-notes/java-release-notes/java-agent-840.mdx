## New features and improvements

- Added a public preview of the Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) mode of the [New Relic Security agent](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent).

<Callout variant="caution">
   The New Relic Security agent IAST mode is in public preview and should only be used in non-production environments.
</Callout>

To learn about how to use IAST, [check out our documentation](/docs/iast/use-iast/).

By default, the New Relic Security agent IAST mode is completely disabled. To enable it, set both `newrelic.config.security.agent.enabled=true` and `newrelic.config.security.enabled=true`.

Full configuration options are detailed below (note that the `security` stanza should be indented two spaces under the pre-existing `common` stanza in the `newrelic.yml` config file):

```
  # New Relic Security vulnerability detection.
  security:
    # Determines whether the security data is sent to New Relic or not. When this is disabled and agent.enabled is
    # true, the security module will run but data will not be sent. Default is false.
    enabled: false

    # New Relic Security provides two modes: IAST and RASP
    # Default is IAST. Due to the invasive nature of IAST scanning, DO NOT enable this mode in either a
    # production environment or an environment where production data is processed.
    mode: IAST

    # New Relic Security's SaaS connection URL
    validator_service_url: wss://csec.nr-data.net

    # To completely disable all security functionality, set this flag to false. This property is
    # read only once at application start. Default is false.
    agent:
      enabled: false

    # These are the category of security events that can be detected. Set to false to disable detection of
    # individual event types. Default is true for each event type.
    detection:
      rci:
        enabled: true
      rxss:
        enabled: true
      deserialization:
        enabled: true
```

## Update to latest version [#procedures]

To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run `java -jar newrelic.jar -v`. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console.

Then, to update to the latest Java agent version:

1. Back up the **entire** [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent) to another location. Rename that directory to `NewRelic_Agent#.#.#`, where `#.#.#` is the agent version number.
2. [Download the agent.](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
3. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy `newrelic-api.jar` and `newrelic.jar` into the original [Java agent root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#java-agent).
4. Compare your old `newrelic.yml` with the newly downloaded `newrelic.yml` from the zip, and [update the file if needed](#diff).
5. Restart your Java dispatcher.

If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory.

## Update agent config differences [#diff]

We add new settings to `newrelic.yml` as we release new versions of the agent. You can use `diff` or another diffing utility to see what's changed, and add the new config settings to your old file. Make sure not to overwrite any customizations you've made to the file, such as your license key, app name, or changes to default settings.

For example, if you `diff` the default `newrelic.yml` files for Java agent versions 7.10.0 and 7.11.0, the results printed to the console will be like:

```
➜ diff newrelic_7.10.0.yml newrelic_7.11.0.yml
...
107a108,119
>       # Whether the log events should include context from loggers with support for that.
>       include_context_data:
>
>         # When true, application logs will contain context data.
>         enabled: false
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should be sent to New Relic.
>         #include:
>
>         # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should not be sent to New Relic.
>         #exclude:
>
125a138

128c141
<     enabled: false
---
>     enabled: true
...
```

In this example, these lines were added to the default `newrelic.yml` in Java agent version 7.11.0. If you are moving to 7.11.0 or higher, you should add these new lines to your original `newrelic.yml`.

## Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
