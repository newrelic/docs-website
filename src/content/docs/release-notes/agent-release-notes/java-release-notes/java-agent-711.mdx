* Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics

Due to overhead caused in some applications [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/)
is now disabled by default.

It can be enabled using the [agent settings (newrelic.yml)](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#jfr-real-time-profiling).

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).
