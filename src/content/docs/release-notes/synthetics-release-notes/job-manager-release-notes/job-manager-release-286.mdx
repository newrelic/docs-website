### Improvements 
* Increased memory allocation for the `ping-runtime` from 0.5 GB to 1.0 GB to improve overall reliability and stability of the ping-runtime.

### Fixes 
* Customers occasionally encountered obstacles due to the minimum thread count being sourced from the environment, while the maximum count remained static. Customers can now boot SJM with fewer problems.
