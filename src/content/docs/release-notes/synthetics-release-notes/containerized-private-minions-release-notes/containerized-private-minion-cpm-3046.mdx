### Changes

* Scripted API and Scripted Browser monitors no longer fail based on response codes.
  * Before this change, a scripted API/Browser monitor would fail if the first request returned
    an Error response code (4xx/5xx). However the script would not fail if any subsequent request
    returned a failed response code.
  * If you would like to fail on response code, please use asserts.
