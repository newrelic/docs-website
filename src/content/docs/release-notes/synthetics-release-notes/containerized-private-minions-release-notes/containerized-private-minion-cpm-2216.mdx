### New features

Minions now capture more page metrics when you run a simple or scripted browser check with synthetic monitoring!

* `firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint` paint performance values are now being collected.
* `longRunningTaskCount` is now being computed `( longRunningTasksAvgTime, longRunningTasksCount, longRunningTasksMaxTime, longRunningTasksMinTime)`.
* Navigation timing metrics are now being collected: `loadEventStart, loadEventEnd, unloadEventStart, unloadEventEnd, domComplete, domInteractive, domContentLoadedEventStart, domContentLoadedEventEnd`.
* All of these values are available as attributes on the `SyntheticRequest` event, in Insights, NR1, and on the [monitor results page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/view-monitor-results#finding).

Refer to Google's Performance and navigation timing API's for more details:

* Google's [User-centric Performance Metrics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/user-centric-performance-metrics) contains detailed information about its Paint Timing API and longRunningTasksCount.
* Google's [Navigation and Resource Timing Load Performance Assessment](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/navigation-and-resource-timing) contains detailed information about its Navigation Timing API.
