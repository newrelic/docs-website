  This release has known issues. Please stay on CPM Version 3.0.37, or upgrade to latest.

### Improvements

* Selenium Timeouts such as PageLoad, Implicit, and Script are managed to ensure jobs can't exceed the JobTimeout.

### Fixes

* Fixed Issue where a job that's already gracefully shutting down could hit the JobTimeout and terminate shutdown tasks.

### Known Issues

* Users cannot disable implicit timeouts. Setting Implicit Timeout to 0 causes the implicit timeout to be set to JobTimeout (180s for Public Minions).
* `$browser.findElement(...)` does not return a `WebElementPromise`. Meaning users cannot use methods such as `.click()` or `.sendKeys(...)` directly on the findElement method.
