### Improvements

* Updated Chrome browser to version 143.0.7499.146. Users may observe a deprecation warning in browser logs stating "Automatic fallback to software WebGL has been deprecated." This change removes the automatic fallback functionality to address a high-severity security vulnerability ([CVE-2025-14765](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_16.html)).
