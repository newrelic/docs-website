### Improvements
* Requiring all needed modules at the start of the runtime rather than in the environment file will kick off the builds sooner resulting in some saved time in the performance metrics.
* Simple Browser monitors should run faster due to having timeout limits set on requests for SSL check
* Added headers to all matching domains, but not urls that do not share the base domain
* Improved performance for allow and deny lists
