### Improvements
* Required all needed modules at the start of the runtime which allowed the kick off the builds sooner resulting in some saved time in the performance metrics.
* Simple Browser monitors should run faster due to having timeout limits set on requests for SSL checks
* Added headers to all matching domains, but not urls that do not share the base domain
* Improved performance for allow and deny lists
