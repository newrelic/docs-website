### New

* In order to optimize the volume of calls to AWS APIs, the [cloud integrations setting](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) options have been enhanced. In particular:
  * New Relic will be using the same polling interval for metrics and inventory data from now on.
  * Many options for you to control the amount of inventory data that New Relic collects from your cloud account have been added: tags, extended inventory, regions, entity name prefixes, resource groups, etc. Please find which attributes are fetched by enabling extended inventory in the specific document for [each cloud integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list).
* You can enable or disable the collection of extended inventory attributes through New Relic's user interface for [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-dynamodb-monitoring-integration), [AWS ElastiCache](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-elasticache-monitoring-integration) and [Google Cloud BigQuery](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-bigquery-monitoring-integration).
* The [AWS Lambda integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-lambda-monitoring-integration) has been extended with additional metrics and inventory attributes:
  * The `ServerlessSample` event type now includes `deadLetterErrors` and `iteratorAge` metrics, both for functions and function aliases. Additionally, it includes the `concurrentExecutions` metric for functions that have a custom concurrency limit specified.
  * For functions, inventory (under `aws/lambda/function/`) now includes the `kmsKeyArn`, `masterArn`, `revisionId` and `layers` attributes.
  * For function aliases, inventory (under `aws/lambda/alias/`) now includes the `revisionId` and `routingConfig` attributes.
  * For mappings between an AWS resource and a function, inventory (under `aws/lambda/event-source-mapping/`) now includes the `stateTransitionReason` attribute.

### Bug fixes

* [Google BigQuery](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-bigquery-monitoring-integration) tables with no schema were lacking some inventory attributes.â€‹
