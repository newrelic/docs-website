### New: Enable or disable attribute collection via UI

You can enable or disable the collection of extended inventory attributes through New Relic's user interface for AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Route53 and Simple Notification Service (SNS). This tool helps you reduce the amount of calls that New Relic does to AWS APIs, and it might contribute to contain your AWS bill. For more information, see the documentation for:

* [Configuring the polling frequency](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) of data collection through the Infrastructure integrations UI
* Attributes that make part of extended inventory in each cloud integration

### New: View errors fetching data via UI

Also, the cloud integrations **Account status** dashboard shows any errors New Relic might experience when trying to fetch inventory and metric data for your cloud resources. The **Fetching errors** chart now shows the cloud service these resources belong to. This will help to facilitate troubleshooting the integration setup.
