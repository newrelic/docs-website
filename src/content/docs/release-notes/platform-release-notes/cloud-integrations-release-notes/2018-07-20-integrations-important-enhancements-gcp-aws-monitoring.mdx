### New for Amazon Web Services monitoring

* New Relic has optimized the way to fetch metrics from AWS Cloudwatch. This has resulted in a **significant reduction in the number of calls to your AWS Cloudwatch service, as well as a reduction in data lag**. The list of [specific permissions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) that are required to fetch monitoring data from AWS services has been updated accordingly, with the additional `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` permission.  
  **Recommendation:** Use a custom policy only when you are unable to use the `ReadOnlyAccess`managed policy from AWS. If you use a custom policy, be sure to check that the new permission is included.
* **AWS Redshift** integration now provides **four new metrics** to monitor the performance of multi-node clusters: `QueriesCompletedPerSecond`, `WLMQueriesCompletedPerSecond`, `QueryDuration`, and `WLMQueryDuration`. Check [AWS Redshift integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-redshift-integration) for details.
* If you use **AWS API Gateway**, you can now fine-tune the data gathered for this service by specifying the stages you want to monitor with the new **Filter by stage name prefixes**. Check [Configure polling frequency and data collection for cloud integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) for details.

### New for Google Cloud Platform monitoring

* **Google Kubernetes Engine** integration is now available. If you're using Kubernetes v1.10.2 or later, now you can get visibility into containers, nodes, and pods. This cloud integration is complementary to New Relic's [Kubernetes on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration).
* **You can now link your GCP projects to New Relic using a service account**. If you had already used a user account to link your projects, you can migrate to the new authorization type, though the UI. Check [Connect Google Cloud Platform services to Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure) for details.

### Changes in Google Cloud Platform integrations

* The default dashboards for Google Cloud Platform integrations now include a **filter by Project ID**. This is very useful if you monitor more than one project from the same Google Stackdriver Monitor service.
