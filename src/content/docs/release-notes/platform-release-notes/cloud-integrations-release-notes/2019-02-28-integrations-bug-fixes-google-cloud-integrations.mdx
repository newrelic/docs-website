### Bug fixes

* Some [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-kubernetes-engine-monitoring-integration) entities had duplicate identifiers. In order to fix this issue, New Relic has regenerated the internal `entityId` and `externalKey` attributes for all containers in Insights events and Infrastructure inventory for this cloud integration.
  * This change doesn't have any impact either on the integration default dashboard provided by New Relic Infrastructure or on the Insights queries.
  * However, all entities related to Google Kubernetes Engine will be created again in Inventory. Accordingly, you might see duplicated entities for 48 hours, until the old identifiers expire. This might also cause an unexpected volume of **Entity created** events.

* â€‹Metadata for [Google Compute Engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-compute-engine-monitoring-integration) virtual machines was not being added to the metric events reported by the New Relic Infrastructure agent. In order to fix this issue, New Relic has regenerated the internal `externalKey` attribute for all virtual machines and disks in Insights events and Infrastructure inventory for this cloud integration.

* For Google Cloud integrations, the value of the `zone` attribute was not reported consistently. As a consequence, some inventory attributes and event metadata, such as `project`, were not reported for some [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-storage-monitoring-integration) buckets.
