### New

* By default, Infrastructure collects EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Now the [AWS EC2 monitoring integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ec2-monitoring-integration) includes a **[toggle](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) not to store and display these IP data** as inventory or Insights events metadata.

### Changes

* The New Relic Infrastructure menu structure has been updated to make it **easier to navigate** the data.

  * Now the three supported cloud providers tabs (**AWS**, **Azure** and **GCP**) are always visible in the Infrastructure navigation bar.
  * All metrics for hosts are now grouped under a **Hosts** section. Metrics related to system, network, storage, processes are accessible using new navigation tabs.
  * On-host services such as Nginx, MySQL or Redis are grouped under a new **Third-party services** navigation item, while the Kubernetes cluster explorer can be accessed from the **Kubernetes** tab.
