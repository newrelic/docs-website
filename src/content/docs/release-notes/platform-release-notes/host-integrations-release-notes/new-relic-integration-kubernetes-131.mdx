## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

**Added**: Pod Volume metrics. Monitor disk volume space and inodes for [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) and [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with pods. See the detailed [list of attributes in the documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#volume-data).

**Added**: Cluster name is now added to agent data as the clusterName attribute so that you can easily correlate Kubernetes integration data with agent data.

**Fixed**: In version 1.3.0, the volume bytes and inodes usage percentage calculation were incorrect.
