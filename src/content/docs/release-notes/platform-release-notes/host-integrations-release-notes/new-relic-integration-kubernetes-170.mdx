## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

**Added**: Support for `kube-state-metrics` (KSM) 1.5.

**Added**: The `reason` and `message` attributes are added to `K8sPodSample`. This will provide visibility into why a pod status is `Failed`.

For example, a pod that failed due to memory pressure on the node will report the following attributes:

* `Status: Failed`
* `Reason: Evicted`
* `Message: Pod The node was low on resource: [MemoryPressure]`

It is possible to create an alert for any of these attributes.

**Added**: The `memoryWorkingSetBytes` attribute is added to `K8sContainerSample`. This metric is used by the OOMkiller to decide when a container is using too much memory compared to its limit and should therefore be killed. It will enable more precise monitoring of the memory usage for containers.

**Changed**: Always request metrics from `kube-state-metrics` in text format. In KSM's v1.5 this is the default regardless of the format requested.
