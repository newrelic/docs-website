### New

* Mobile Monitoring UI has a new Enterprise-level **HTTP requests** page. This allows you to group, sort, and filter HTTP requests.
* Mobile Monitoring UI has a new and improved overview page.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where permalinks were not consistently linking to the correct time window.
* Fixed a **Crash analysis** UI page issue where the crash detail page would lock up when downloading or viewing large stack traces.

### Changes

* The **Crash analysis** UI has better logic around stack trace symbolication/obfuscation status.

### Notes

* For more on how to use the new **HTTP requests** UI please see [HTTP requests page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/http-requests-page).
