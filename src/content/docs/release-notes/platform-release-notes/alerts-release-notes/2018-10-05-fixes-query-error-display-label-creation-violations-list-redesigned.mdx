### Bug fixes

* When copy-pasting queries, NRQL query errors were not displayed properly. This has been fixed and now errors are correctly shown in the NRQL condition form.
* Fixed a cache out of sync which sometimes prevented creating labels via the API.  

### Changes

* The Violations list state layer has been re-architected to provide a snappier, more responsive UX.
