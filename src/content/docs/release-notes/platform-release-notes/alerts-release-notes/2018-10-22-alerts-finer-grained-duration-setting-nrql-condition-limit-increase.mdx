### New

* Conditions now support finer grained durations.
* Duration was a dropdown; now it is an input field.

### Bug fixes

* [Outlier detection conditions now evaluate missing signals as zero](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/outlier-detection-nrql-alert); these values are not evaluated as part of the condition.
* Fixed issue that caused large (> {'~'}350 facets) outlier detection conditions to not evaluate in some cases.

### Changes

* Max number of NRQL conditions per account raised from 2,000 to 4,000
