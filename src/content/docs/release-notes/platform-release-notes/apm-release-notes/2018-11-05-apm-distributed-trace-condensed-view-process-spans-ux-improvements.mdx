### New

* A new condensed trace view helps you quickly understand the service-level call flow.
* You now have the option to turn on in-process spans in the trace view. Previously, these spans were not displayed and were only accessible via Insights queries.
* More trace view improvements: unique color coding per service, child span count is viewable when the parent span is collapsed, icons to represent span type.
