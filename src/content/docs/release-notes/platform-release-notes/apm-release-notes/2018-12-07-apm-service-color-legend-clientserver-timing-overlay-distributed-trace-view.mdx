### New

* In the [distributed trace view](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), added service color legend to describe what color maps to what service.
* In the trace view, added client span overlay to server span for easier detection of clock skew and network or transport time.
* Visual improvements to the waterfall visualization to better display deeply nested traces.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where navigating to the distributed trace page with a `server` filter selected resulted in an error.
* Fixed an issue where the service name in a deployment marker hover over appeared as `undefined`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented filtering by span name if the span name contained a backslash.
* Fixed an issue where span detail charts would not load if the span name contained a backslash.
