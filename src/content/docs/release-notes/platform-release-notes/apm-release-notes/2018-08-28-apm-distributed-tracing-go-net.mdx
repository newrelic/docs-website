  * .NET: 8.6.45.0 or higher
  * Go: 2.1.0 or higher
* `Span` event types from these agents are queryable in New Relic Insights.

### Notes

* Enabling distributed tracing results in changes to some APM features. Before enabling, it's recommended you read the [distributed tracing transition guide](/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing#rollout).
* For how to enable distributed tracing via New Relic agent configuration, see [Enable distributed tracing](/docs/enable-distributed-tracing).
