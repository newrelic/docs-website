### New

* View deployments for all services involved in traces you're viewing. (For more information, see [Record a deployment in New Relic](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/record-deployments).)
* See how different types of traces may have different characteristics by grouping traces by errors, root service, root entry span, and service entry span.
