### New

* In the distributed trace view, added “Anomalous spans detected” indicator that shows a count of anomalous spans found in the trace. Clicking the indicator opens a list of anomalous spans for easy navigation.
* In the distributed trace view, anomalous spans are now highlighted in the waterfall view with an icon.
* Added histogram chart in the span details panel.
