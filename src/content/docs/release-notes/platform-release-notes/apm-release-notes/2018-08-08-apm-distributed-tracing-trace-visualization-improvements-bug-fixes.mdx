### New

* In the trace view, clarified span counts by adding **Total span** and **Spans displayed** counts on waterfall view with tooltips to define those terms and a link to docs for additional information.
* In the span details view, the span name links to its respective APM feature for additional detail. For example, a database span links to the "Databases" page in APM. The same cross-feature linking connects **Transaction** spans and **External call** spans to their respective pages in APM.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue that was preventing the scatter chart from displaying correctly in Safari 10.
* Fixed display issues in IE 11
