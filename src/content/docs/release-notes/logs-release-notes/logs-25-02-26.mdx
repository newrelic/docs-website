### New Feature: AWS Logs in Context

We are excited to introduce the new [AWS Logs in Context](/docs/logs/logs-context/aws-logs-in-context/) feature in our latest release. This feature enhances log management by providing a seamless linkage between logs and their corresponding AWS resources (entities), including automatic entity creation and association, and seamless bidirectional navigation between entities and logs.

### Added

* **[AWS Logs in Context](/docs/logs/logs-context/aws-logs-in-context/)**: your AWS service logs will automatically be associated with the specific AWS resource (entity) that generated them. If the entity does not yet exist, the system will automatically create it. This features enables you to use the Entity Explorer to search for specific AWS resources and navigate quickly between logs and their generating entities. The following AWS entity types are currently supported:
  * Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  * Classic Load Balancer (ELB)
  * CloudFront Distribution
  * Elastic Beanstalk EC2 Instance
  * Lambda Function
  * Network Load Balancer (NLB)
  * Relational Database Service (RDS) Instance
  * S3 Bucket
