### OpenTelemetry: Support for complex data structures

New Relic now supports complex data structures in OTLP Logs. Checkout the details in the [OTEL best practices docs](/docs/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs).

### Added

* **Support complex data structures in OTLP Logs**: Your `LogRecord#body` and `LogRecord#attrbitues` can hold non-primitive values, such as arrays and [maps](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#type-mapstring-any).
