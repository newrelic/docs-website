### Notes

In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business.

Moving forward, we will be summarizing the most recent fixes and enhancements captured in this ongoing changelog. To stay up to date, subscribe to our [Logs RSS feed](/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes/). More to come soon!

### New public APIs

* In addition to the Logs UI for [data partition management](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/), you can now use our public API. Data partitions help you query more efficiently by scanning less unrelated data and returning results faster. To get started, see our [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-data-partition-rules-tutorial/). 
* Parsing rules are also publicly accessible via the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api/). We already provide [built-in parsing rulesets](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/built-log-parsing-rulesets/) to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts.
* If you can't use log forwarders when collecting logs from CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services, you can use `syslog` protocols via a [TCP endpoint](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic/).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed link to see logs from the [Fluentd forwarder](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding/).
* Fixed crash when browsing after using a [saved view](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#saved-views).
* Fixed scenario where [logs in context for distributed tracing](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) wouldn't work.

### Changes

* Because of intermittent Fluent Bit build failures, SUSE will no longer be a supported platform for the [infrastructure monitoring agent's log forwarder](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). We are working on adding SUSE support in the next six months.
