### Update to AWS-log-ingestion Lambda function

Users no longer need to manually enable logging for New Relic. The `NRLoggingEnabled` parameter is now set to `true` by default.

### Changed

The default value of the `NRLoggingEnabled` parameter for the New Relic Lambda function has been changed from `false` to `true`. Users were required to manually enable this parameter to forward logs to New Relic, adding an extra step to the setup process. This change simplifies the setup process and ensures logs are automatically sent to New Relic.
