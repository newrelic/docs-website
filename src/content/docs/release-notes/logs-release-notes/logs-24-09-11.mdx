### Support for Amazon Linux 2023 (AArch64) 

The infrastructure agent now supports Amazon Linux 2023 (AArch64). This enhancement ensures broader compatibility and better performance on these platforms.

### Changed

When users attempt to install the Infrastructure Agent from Add Integrations in New Relic, the installation process now correctly includes the necessary definitions for Amazon Linux 2023 (AArch64). Previously, logs-integration support was not available for these platforms. This issue has now been resolved, ensuring Fluent Bit is correctly installed on these platforms. This guarantees that logs are properly forwarded to New Relic, maintaining seamless log monitoring and analysis. To see all supported OS distributions for the Infrastructure Agent, please refer to [infrastructure agent's log forwarder](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/).
