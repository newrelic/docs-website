### Enhanced functionality for log tables in dashboards

We've made it even easier for you to explore your logs data as table widgets in dashboards. After you [create your dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards#dashboards-create), you can:

* Use standard dashboard widget functions, such as copying, editing, deleting, etc.
* Click any log row to show details about it.
* Update your query to add more columns.
* Query log data from other available accounts, and add more charts (for example, as comparative data) to your dashboard.
* Click **Open in logs** to go directly to the [**Logs** UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui) for additional troubleshooting.

### APM logs in context available for Node.js

[APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context) is now available for Node.js! (It was also released earlier this month for Java, .NET, and Ruby.) For more information, see our [Node.js logs in context procedures](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-nodejs) for agent [v8.11.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/).

If your APM agent doesn't support our automatic logs in context solution yet, you can continue to use our [manual logs in context solutions](/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context/), and forward your logs via our infrastructure agent or supported third-party forwarder.
