<Callout variant="caution">
**Defective release**: this release has a known issue where process metrics might be reported even if `enable_process_metrics` is undefined or set to `false` in agent settings.
</Callout>

Please consider one of these alternatives:
* Use any version lower than `1.57.0`
* Upgrade to `1.57.2` or later. 
* Use `metrics_process_sample_rate: -1` to completely disable process monitoring.
