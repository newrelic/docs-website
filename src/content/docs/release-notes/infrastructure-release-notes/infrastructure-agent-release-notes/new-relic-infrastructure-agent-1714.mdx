## Fixed

* Fixed `transmitBytesPerSecond` showing zero during high traffic on Windows (NR-502872) in [#2166](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/2166)

  <Callout variant="important">
    To enable this fix, you must set the [`win_network_interface_v2`](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#win-network-interface-v2) configuration option to `true`. This option uses 64-bit counters instead of 32-bit counters for network metrics on Windows.
  </Callout>
