## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Processes metrics can be enabled for new accounts

By default, the Infrastructure agent doesn't send [data about the operating system's processes](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8412). The agent still collects such data, unless [`metrics_process_sample_rate`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#metrics-process-sample-rate) is set to `-1`.

The sending of processes data to New Relic can be manually enabled by setting [`enable_process_metrics`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#enable-process-metrics) to `true`. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure [`include_matching_metrics`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#include-matching-metrics).

> **Accounts and subaccounts created before July 20, 2020** have `enable_process_metrics` set to `true` by default; this can be overridden by setting a different value in the config file.
