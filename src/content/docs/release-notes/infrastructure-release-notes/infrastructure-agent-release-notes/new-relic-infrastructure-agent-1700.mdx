A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [Infrastructure agent 1.58.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1580/).

## Changed
* feat(oci): add Oracle Cloud-specific tags to hosts running on OCI in https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/2121

  Starting with version 1.70.0, the New Relic Infrastructure agent now automatically collects metadata for VMs running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The agent collects the following details:
  - displayName
  - host.id
  - oci.availabilityDomain
  - oci.region
  - oci.compartmentId
  - oci.shape
  - oci.imageId
  
  You can use this metadata as tags for entity search or as attributes in NRQL queries. The `host.id` attribute is also used by the New Relic Cloud Integration for OCI to attach cloud metadata to the correct host entity.
  
  This feature is enabled by default to ensure consistency with existing metadata on other cloud providers. If you need to disable this feature, you can use the configuration settings [disable_cloud_metadata](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#disable-cloud-metadata) or [disable_cloud_instance_id](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#disable-cloud-instance-id).
  
  _Background_:
  For many years already, New Relic Infrastructure Agents installed on a VM running in AWS, Azure or GCP had the equivalent metadata detail collection, and this behavior is enabled by default. For consistency across different clouds, the OCI feature is using the same configuration items and the same default behavior.
