releaseDate: '2025-10-21'
version: 1.70.0
---
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [Infrastructure agent 1.58.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1580/).

## Changed
* feat(oci): add Oracle Cloud-specific tags to hosts running on OCI in https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/2121

  Starting with version 1.70.0, the new relic infrastructure agent collects the following details for VMâ€™s running inside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): 
  - displayName
  - host.id
  - oci.availabilityDomain
  - oci.region
  - oci.compartmentId
  - oci.shape
  - oci.imageId
  
  These details are available as tags for the New Relic entity search, and as attributes for queries via NRQL. Additionally, the host.id is important for the upcoming NR Cloud Integration for OCI, to make sure that any additional metadata will get attached to the correct Host entity.
  
  The infra agent metadata functionality is enabled by default. Customers who would like to disable this feature can use the configuration items [disable_cloud_metadata](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#disable-cloud-metadata) or [disable_cloud_instance_id](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#disable-cloud-instance-id).
  
  _Background_:
  For many years already, New Relic Infrastructure Agents installed on a VM running in AWS, Azure or GCP had the equivalent metadata detail collection, and this behavior is enabled by default. For consistency across different clouds, the OCI feature is using the same configuration items and the same default behavior.
