A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

We recommend you upgrade the infrastructure agent regularly, at least every three months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [agent version 1.23.3](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1233).


## Added
* New configuration option ['cloud_provider'](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#cloud-provider) that allows to explicitly set the Cloud Provider instead of using the automatic detection. Cloud Provider is required in order to collect host metadata. https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/1614
