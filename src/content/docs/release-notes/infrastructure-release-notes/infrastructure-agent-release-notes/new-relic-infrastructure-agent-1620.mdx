A new version of the Fluent Bit version has been released with a fix for [CVE-2024-50608](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50608),  [CVE-2024-50609](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50609). Previous versions of [Fluent Bit in the 3.1 and 3.2](https://fluentbit.io/announcements/) series are affected by two security vulnerabilities if customers use the [OpenTelemetry input plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/opentelemetry) or [Prometheus Remote Write input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/prometheus-remote-write).

* Windows Infrastructure Agent:  upgraded to v1.62.0
* Linux Infrastructure Agent: upgraded the Infrastracture agent to v1.62.0 or later, AND update Fluent Bit to v3.2.7 or later

## Changed
* By default, New Relic does not include these plugins in our distribution of the Fluent Bit packages in any of the instrumentation packages we provide. However, in order to support customers using these plugins and mitigate any potential impact, we recommend customers to upgrade their Fluent Bit versions embedded in the Infrastracture agent log forwarder solution to version 3.2.7.
