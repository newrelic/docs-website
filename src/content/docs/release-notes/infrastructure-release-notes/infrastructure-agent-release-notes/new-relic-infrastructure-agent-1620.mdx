---
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [Infrastructure agent 1.50.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1500/).

## Security
A new version of the Fluent Bit version has been released with a fix for [CVE-2024-50608](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50608),  [CVE-2024-50609](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50609). Previous versions of [Fluent Bit in the 3.1 and 3.2](https://fluentbit.io/announcements/) series are affected by two security vulnerabilities if customers use the [OpenTelemetry input plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/opentelemetry) or [Prometheus Remote Write input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/prometheus-remote-write).

* Windows Infrastructure Agent:  upgraded to v1.62.0
* Linux Infrastructure Agent: upgraded the Infrastructure agent to v1.62.0 or later, AND update Fluent Bit to v3.2.7 or later

By default, New Relic does not include these plugins in our distribution of the Fluent Bit packages in any of the instrumentation packages we provide. However, in order to support customers using these plugins and mitigate any potential impact, we recommend customers to upgrade their Fluent Bit versions embedded in the Infrastructure agent log forwarder solution to version 3.2.7.
