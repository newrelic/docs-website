## Added
[#589](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/589) Detailed log to help troubleshoot payloads sent to New Relic platform when pushing event samples (non dimensional metrics). [This example](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/e494cf2eb457bda5eb1d8d8cb44ee2471b72935d/assets/examples/infrastructure/newrelic-infra-template.yml.example#L716) shows how to enable trace-level logging.

## Changed

[#562](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/562) Log forwarder as "recommended" package dependency in linux systems.
  * Supported distributions have enabled "recommends" declared dependencies out of the box. Unless this is disabled, installation should be transparent.
  * In case your distribution has disabled "recommends" dependencies you'll need to explicitly enable it via `apt-get -o APT::Install-Suggests="true" install newrelic-infra`.
