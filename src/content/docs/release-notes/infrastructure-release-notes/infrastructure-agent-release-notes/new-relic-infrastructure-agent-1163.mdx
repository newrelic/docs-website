version: 1.16.3

## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
  
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

## Fixes
- **Linux specific**: Fixed issue when log-forwarder (*Fluent Bit*) was not able to process *systemd* logs. Due to a transition from building the Infra Agent in our previous internal pipeline to the publicly available GitHub actions, we applied the following changes:
  * Included Fluent Bit 1.6.3, built by our previous internal pipeline, from (here)[https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/releases/tag/1.3.0]. 
  * Included Fluent Bit Output Plugin for New Relic v1.4.3 from (here)[https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases/tag/v1.1.0].
