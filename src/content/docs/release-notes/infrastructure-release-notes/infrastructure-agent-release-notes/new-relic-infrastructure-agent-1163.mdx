## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

## Fixes

* **Linux specific**: Fixed issue when log-forwarder (_Fluent Bit_) was not able to process _systemd_ logs. Due to a transition from building the Infra Agent in our previous internal pipeline to the publicly available GitHub actions, we applied the following changes:
  * Included Fluent Bit 1.6.3, built by our previous internal pipeline, from (here)[https://github.com/newrelic/fluent-bit-package/releases/tag/1.3.0].
  * Included Fluent Bit Output Plugin for New Relic v1.4.3 from (here)[https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases/tag/v1.1.0].
