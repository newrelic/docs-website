## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
We recommend you to upgrade the agent every 3 months.

## Changed
* All environment variables defined in integration config files treated as uppercase. Also, the variables printed in payload output log. [#676](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/676).

## Added 
*  Brew formula file to publish the initial Beta of the infrastructure agent on Homebrew for macOS. See the homebrew-core [PR status](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/82746) and [our public documentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/) to learn more about requirements and limitations for macOS support. 

## Fixed
* Certain configuration settings printed as memory addresses instead of values. For example, `enable_process_metrics` [#647](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/647).
