## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).  
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

## Added

* Added the following new host memory metrics (see [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8407&event=SystemSample)):
  * memoryCachedBytes
  * memorySharedBytes
  * memorySlabBytes
* Agent self instrumentation [#477](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/477)
  * This is a base implementation of a prometheus endpoint to gather some metrics about agent runtime and a few product metrics.
  * In order to work, agent opens a port with prom data and starts nri-prometheus integration to scrap prom endpoint and send data to the backend.
* Status API [#475](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/475). See [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/docs/status_api.md)

## Changed

* Upgraded `nri-prometheus` to v2.7.0 [#517](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/517)
* Updates `Winlog.yml` sample [#336](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/336)
