## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).  
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

## Added
- Added the following new host memory metrics (see [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8407&event=SystemSample)):
    - memoryCachedBytes
    - memorySharedBytes
    - memorySlabBytes
- Agent self instrumentation [#477](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/477)
    - This is a base implementation of a prometheus endpoint to gather some metrics about agent runtime and a few product metrics. 
    - In order to work, agent opens a port with prom data and starts nri-prometheus integration to scrap prom endpoint and send data to the backend.
- Status API [#475](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/475). See [docs](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/docs/status_api.md)
