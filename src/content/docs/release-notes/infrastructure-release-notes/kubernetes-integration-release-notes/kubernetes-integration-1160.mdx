## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

* **Added:** Support for completely avoid querying Kube State Metrics. It's behind the `DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS` environment variable and its default value is `false`. Note that disabling this will imply missing metrics that are collected from KSM and possibly missing features in the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. Please, refer to our [official documentation on this configuration option](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration#disable-kube-state-metrics) for more information.
