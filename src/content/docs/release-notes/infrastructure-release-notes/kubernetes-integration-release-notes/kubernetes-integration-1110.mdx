## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

* **Added:** Control Plane Monitoring: from this release on the Kubernetes integration will automatically monitor your Control Plane, showing each component and their health status in the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. Managed Kubernetes Clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS, DO, etc) are not supported, due to technical restrictions.
* **Added**: KSM can now be discovered using custom pod labels. By default we look for pods with the labels `k8s-app`, `app` or `app.kubernetes.io/name` with the value `kube-state-metrics`.  
  If you want to use a custom label for the discovery, you should put the label name in the environment variable named `KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL`.

  If more than 1 pod is found with the label, it will always choose the first one based on a sorted list of IP addresses.  
  Example:

  ```
  # Label a specific KSM pod. Always set the value to the string "true".
  kubectl label pod kube-state-metrics newrelic-ksm=true
  ```

  Update the newrelic-infrastructure-k8s manifest to use this labeled KSM pod:

  ```
  env:
  - name: KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL
    value: newrelic-ksm
  ```
