## Deprecation notice: Kubernetes [#deprecation-notice]
Dec 23, 2021
 
Effective Monday, 1 January  2022, Kubernetes cluster with versions prior to v1.16 will no longer be supported. For more information, read this note or contact your account team.

## Background [#bg]

Enabling compatibility with the latest Kubernetes versions and adding new features to our Kubernetes offering avoid us being backward compatible with versions prior to v1.16.

## What is happening? [#what-is-happening]

* The latest Kubernetes version v1.22 has API incompatibilities with versions prior to v1.16.
* A majority of major Kubernetes cloud providers have already deprecated these old versions.

## What do you need to do? [#what-to-do]

Upgrade your Kubernetes clusters to a supported version.

## What happens if you don't make any changes to your account? [#account]

The Kubernetes integration may continue to work with end-of-lifed versions. However, we can't guarantee the quality of the solution as new releases may cause some incompatibilities. 
Support requests regarding these end-of-lifed versions won't be accepted.
