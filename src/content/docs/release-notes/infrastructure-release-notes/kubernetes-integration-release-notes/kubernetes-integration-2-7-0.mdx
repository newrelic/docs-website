### Added

* Integration now reports node status and conditions as `condition.{Name}` (for example `condition.Ready`, `condition.PIDPressure`).
* Added the new `KubeStateMetricsNamespace` parameter to restrict discovery of KSM pod to a particular namespace.
  * This should help reduce load in the control plane for clusters with many pods and/or nodes.
* Added the `unschedulable` metric to K8sNodeSamples.
* Added the `podIP` metric to K8sPodSample.
