### Added

- Integration now reports node status and conditions as `condition.{Name}` (for example `condition.Ready`, `condition.PIDPressure`).
- Added the new `KubeStateMetricsNamespace` parameter to restrict discovery of KSM pod to a particular namespace.
  * This should help reduce load in the control plane for clusters with many pods and/or nodes.
- Added the `unschedulable` metric to K8sNodeSamples.
- Added the `podIP` metric to K8sPodSample.
