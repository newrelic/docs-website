### Fixed

For Kubernetes versions higher than 1.21: having the apiServer flag `service-account-extend-token-expiration` set to false was causing the `kubelet` scraper pod to be restarted each time the token expired (each hour). 

In EKS due to its implementation a pod restart was caused each 90 days.

### Changed

Updated several dependencies
