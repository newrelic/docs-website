Agentless monitoring for EC2, Azure VM, and standardized entity creation across EC2, Azure VMs, and GCP CE is now available. 

## What's new 

We updated our cloud host monitoring capabilities to help you monitor your Amazon EC2, Azure VM, and GCP CE instances more effectively. You'll now have access to:

* Enhanced visibility into your Amazon EC2 and Azure VM infrastructure without the need for complex setup or configuration.
* Simplified set-up that eliminates manual agent installations and configuration.
* For a cloud resource (EC2, Azure VM, GCP CE) same entity is created when they are instrumented by both agents or as well as in agentless mode (API Polling - AWS/Azure/GCP, Cloudwatch Metric Streams integration, Azure Monitor integration)

New Relic can detect your cloud host instances, create entities for them, and provide comprehensive insight into each host's performance, resource utilization, and health.
