### New

* **New Relic now collects labels** for [Google Compute Engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-compute-engine-monitoring-integration), [Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-kubernetes-engine-monitoring-integration), [Cloud SQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-sql-monitoring-integration), and [Cloud Functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-functions-monitoring-integration) services. They join [BigQuery](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-bigquery-monitoring-integration), [Cloud Spanner](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-spanner-monitoring-integration), [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-pubsub-monitoring-integration), and [Cloud Storage](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-storage-monitoring-integration) integrations, which were collecting labels already.
  With the [appropriate permissions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/integrations-custom-roles), you'll be able to use the following metadata to narrow down queries, dashboards, and alerts related to Google Cloud resources:
  * Labels for Functions.
  * Labels for SQL databases.
  * Labels for Kubernetes clusters, which are propagated to nodes, pods and containers. If you'd like entity specific labels to be collected, you can use the [Kubernetes integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/getting-started/intro-kubernetes).
  * Labels and tags for Compute Engine virtual machines, and labels for disks. Tags are treated as a regular label with value `true`.
* Additionally, **Inventory for [Google Compute Engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-compute-engine-monitoring-integration) and [Google Cloud Functions](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-cloud-functions-monitoring-integration) has been enhanced** with new attributes and restructured, so it's easier to find the metadata that belongs to each entity.
* The aforementioned improvements might cause an unexpected volume of **Entity modified** events, as Inventory will be updated with the new data.
