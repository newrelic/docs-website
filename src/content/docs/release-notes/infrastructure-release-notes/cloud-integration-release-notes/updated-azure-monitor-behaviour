### Update

* The behaviour of the [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported) integration has been optimized to not store metrics in scenarios in which the metric count is zero. The change will prevent delayed metrics from being stored prematurely. 
* The calculation of the timewindows for metrics with a timegrain higher than PT1M has been upgraded with a rounding mechanism which will prevent time slides that could cause datapoints to be seen more than once under some conditions.
