### Update

* A new setting **Keep legacy metadata** has been added in the [AWS EC2 polling integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ec2-monitoring-integration/#legacy-tag-format), disabled by default for new integrations.
* When disabled, legacy attribute formats for EC2 metadata and custom tags will no longer be used. This helps reduce the data ingest quota when those legacy attribute formats are not used in custom dashboards or alert conditions.
