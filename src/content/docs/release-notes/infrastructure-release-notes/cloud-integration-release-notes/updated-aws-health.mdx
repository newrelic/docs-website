### New

* The [AWS Health integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-health-monitoring-integration/) events are now stored as [New Relic events](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api) (previously they were inventory data only).
* They can now be easily queried, added to dashboards, and included in alert conditions.
