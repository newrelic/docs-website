### New

* The [AWS Elasticsearch](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-elasticsearch-monitoring-integration) integration has been updated with new metrics for clusters.

  * You can now monitor the total number of requests to the cluster and the response codes; rates and latency for indexing and search requests; queued tasks in different thread pools, and errors related to encryption keys. Most of these new metrics are useful to decide whether a cluster needs to be scaled up.
  * Additionally, you can enable the collection of some of these metrics at the node level.
* The `regionName` attribute has been added to the New Relic Insights events collected by the [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-sql-database-monitoring-integration) integration: `AzureSqlDatabaseSample` and `AzureSqlElasticPoolSample`.

  * This attribute can be used for grouping and filtering down results in NRQL queries, dashboards and alert conditions.
