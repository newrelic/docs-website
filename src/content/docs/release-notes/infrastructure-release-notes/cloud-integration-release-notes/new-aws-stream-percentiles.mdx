### New

* AWS CloudWatch metric stream now supports [adding percentile statistics](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-cloudwatch-metric-streams-additional-statistics/) to CloudWatch metrics. The New Relic CloudWatch metric stream integration has been updated in order to automatically ingest percentiles defined in metric streams.
  Learn more about this capability from the [CloudWatch metric stream integration documentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup#custom-metrics).
