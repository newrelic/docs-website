## Improvements

We are upgrading our Infrastructure Cloud Alerting to use the New Relic Streaming Alerts backend. While you will not see any changes to the frontend UI or API, the backend implementation is moving to our new streaming alerts pipeline, with streaming algorithms that are specifically tuned for polling based cloud integrations.

As a result, your Infrastructure Cloud Alerts should have a significantly improved time-to-detect (they will be faster), with increased reliability and accuracy. The latency between when your data is retrieved from the cloud provider, and when it is evaluated by the alerts engine should be less than 1 minute. However, we can not improve the time it takes for the cloud provider to return the data to us.

This rollout begins on 11/12/2020, and is targeted to complete by 11/24/2020. There will not be any visual indication when your individual accounts have been migrated. They will just start to perform better. If you experience any issues, please contact customer support or your account team.
