### Fixes to Cloud Integrations API Validations

We're updating how NerdGraph handles certain requests for the `cloud` namespace:

* The validations for boolean fields have been updated. From now on, `null` values will be rejected for these fields.
* The inventory polling interval and metrics polling interval integer fields have been updated as well. Going forward, these fields will no longer accept null values.
* The `tagKey` parameter under GCP and AWS integrations will no longer accept empty strings as value.

These updates are a bugfix that prevent you from using these values, which in some cases are broken or functionally confusing.

Please ensure that you're providing valid values for these fields in your requests.
