## Transport details

SAP transport `SD1K901229` delivered in two files:
  - `K901229.SD1 (co-file)`
  - `R901229.SD1 (data)`
  
## Fixes

**Issue**: One of the standard SAP delivered data elements (`DMC_GUID`) referenced in the New Relic code does not exist in some customer SAP systems. This impacted the SLT replication data providers.

**Resolution**: Created a copy of this data element in the New Relic namespace to resolve.
