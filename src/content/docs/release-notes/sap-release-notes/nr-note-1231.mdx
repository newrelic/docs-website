## Transport details

SAP transport `SD1K901231` delivered in two files:
  - `K901231.SD1` (co-file)
  - `R901231.SD1` (data)

## Data provider enhancements

The `NR_CALM_LANDSCAPE` event is enhanced to include the client endpoints (if any) configured in the system. This does not apply for SAP PaaS/SaaS based services. Example: If your SAP instance has 3 clients - 100, 200, 300... then a separate LMSID would be generated for each one of them.

  - Change the monitoring component for this DP from `CALM` to `LANDSCAPE` in the DP Registry transaction

The `NR.CALM.HM` event is enhanced to send the relevant metrics based on the org_name to respective NR Accounts of the Org unit. This enhancement will be applicable only for `serviceType = SAP_CPI` and for Metrics (`CPI.JMS.Queue.Active, CPI.JMS.Queue.Status, CPI.JMS.Queue.Message.Number`)

  - **New Attribute - ORG_NAME**: Org_name used as filter for **Metrics Name**. Add this field to the template table (`/NEWR/DP_SELOPTIN`) using SM30.

The `NR_CALM_IS_MPL` Data Provider now requires a new parameter_id `SERVICE_TYPE` to differentiate between the `IS CPI` and `MACO` instances. Add this field to the template table (`/NEWR/DP_SELOPTIN`) using SM30.

## Other enhancements

The `/NEWR/SYS_GENERATE_DELIVERY` program is enhanced to exclude the monitoring component `CALM` related **Data Provider** from generation of Call ID configuration. Instead use the program `/NEWR/GEN_DP_CALLID` for monitoring component `CALM`.

The `/NEWR/GEN_DP_CALLID` program is enhanced to update the new attributes added to the Registry Configuration table.

## Fixes

**Issue**: The `NR_CALM_LANDSCAPE` Data Provider does not transmit all systems configured in the Cloud ALM tenant.

**Resolution**:

  - `/NEWR/ABAP_COLLECTION_MANAGERN` (program) - When Data Providers are submitted for parallel processing and if there is a resource constraint of WP, then that particular DP is skipped for data collection. Now we have enabled the retry mechanism.

  - `/NEWR/REGISTRY` (Tcode) - When we generate the Call ID for a new monitored system, the previously suspended data provider is re-activated again.
