### Enhanced AWS Lambda Log Processing with Request ID Injection

New Relic enhances log processing for AWS Lambda functions by ensuring that request IDs are consistently added to logs lacking default runtime annotations. This improves traceability and observability across Lambda invocations.

### Changed

* **Consistent Request ID Annotation:** Logs from AWS Lambda functions now have request IDs added to every message using the UUID found in the first and last log entries. This ensures comprehensive traceability and completeness in log data, enabling more effective monitoring and debugging.
