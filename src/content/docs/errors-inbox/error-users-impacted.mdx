You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group which allows you to focus your effort on the 
highest impacting error groups. Users impacted are listed next to the occurrences metric in the list view. 
You can also set up Alerts for error groups impacting more than a certain number of users.

## Getting started [#getting-started]

User impact metrics are collected automatically if your error events have an attribute identifying the end user. 
For agents that don’t natively support adding a user identifier to telemetry we recommend adding a custom attribute and 
following OpenTelemetry’s convention attribute for identity attributes `enduser.id`. 

## Attribute conventions to capture users impacted [#attributes]
There are multiple common conventions for naming end user attributes. We will first check for `enduser.id`. 
We will then use the following attributes in order of priority:

- `userId`
- `userEmail`
- `user`
- `email` 



### Querying for users impacted [#alerts]

The number of users impacted on an error group is recorded as a metric data type with the name 'newrelic.error.group.user_impact'. You can view the fields on this metric with the following NRQL string:

```
SELECT keyset() FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.user_impact'
```

## Alerting on users impacted

Trigger alerts when the amount of users impacted by errors exceeds a threshold by creating an alert condition.

Creating this alert requires determining the NRQL string which measures the amount of users impacted in the way which best captures your use case.

As an example, the following NRQL query measures the amount of unique users which have been impacted by errors coming from a specific entity:

```
SELECT uniqueCount(newrelic.error.group.user_impact) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.user_impact' AND entity.guid=’RXxCUk9XU9182nNEFQUExJQ0FLsU9OfDgzNzgwNw’ FACET error.group.guid TIMESERIES
```

Similarly, the following NRQL query measures the total number of users impacted by errors from all entities under the account in the last hour:

```
SELECT count(newrelic.error.group.user_impact) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.user_impact' SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

Once the appropriate NRQL string is determined, it can be used as the signal parameter for an alert condition.
