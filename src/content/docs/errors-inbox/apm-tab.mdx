The APM group errors tab is a way for engineering teams to monitor errors in their applications and delve deeply into any issues. 

Let's say you're a lead engineer for a messaging application and you get a ping from one of your stakeholders that says that users are reporting issues with the **Send Message** button. That's a fundamental problem with your application's performance and you'll need to understand what's going wrong and how to fix it as quickly as possible. The first thing you'll do is go go to the **Group errors** tab in the specific application that's experiencing issues.

## Errors list view  [#list-view]

As you try to investigate why the **Send Message** button isn't working in your application, the first place to start is the **Errors list view**. Here you can see error rate charts at a glance and determine if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general.

*Correlate any general patterns on the top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period.
*Dynamic grouping: The default grouping for error occurrences is based on error message, error class, and Transaction UI name. You have the option to change the grouping options by any attribute, up to five attributes at a time.
*Filtering: Many New Relic customers instrument custom attributes and filtering on a specific custom attribute can be a really quick way to cut through the noise of all error occurrences. 

## Errors details view [#details-view]

Once you've investigated your errors as a whole using the list view, you can deep dive on a specific error group. Let's say that you've you've identified a specific group of hosts that is causing an error spike, you can now use the **details view** to better understand in-context details.

*Applied filters & group-by values: You may receive a permalink of a specific occurrence. It's important to know the filters and group-by selections to understand the context of the occurrence. 
*Profiles: The profiles tab helps you observe interesting trends across all error occurrences inside a specific error group. You can download this information as a CSV file for further analysis. When you click on an attribute bar, a table is rendered showing the breakdown of attributes and counts.

## Error occurrences: [#error-occurrences]

The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance in between.

### Triage [#triage-card]

The triage section links the specific error occurrence you’re viewing to a system-created error group that has a unique fingerprint. Why does that matter? That unique fingerprint  enables you to triage an error group using a status update or assignment. The system-created error groups are the ones you find on the Triage tab. For more info on how they are generated, see How error groups work.

### Select the time period for error data [#selected-time-period]

Use the time picker to examine the details of error events over the past week, month, etc. 
Error event data in the Group errors tab is available for up to a 7 day window of data collected over the last eight days. 
Error event metadata in the Triage tab is stored up to 13 months. 

You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.	

### Expected errors [#expected-errors]


Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See [Manage errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected#expected) for more details.

Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Group errors tab. You can show them by turning on the **Show N expected errors** switch below the **Group by** bar.


### Errors outside transactions [#outside-transactions]

Using the New Relic agent API, you can [record custom errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected#error-collection) at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume asynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction.

Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Group errors tab, but if you want to view only errors outside of the transaction, apply the following filter: 

TransactionName = “Unknown”

### Deletion of error traces [#delete-stacktrace]

If you need to delete any sensitive information from the errors experience, we encourage you to submit a request to remove personal data.
