A limited number of accounts may receive the following warning when attempting to use Errors inbox:

### Problem [#problem]

```
You’ve reached the daily limit of unique error groups on account xxx.  This limit will be reset at 00:00 UTC.
```

### Solution [#solution]

To reduce the number of error groups, try removing the unique identifiers from the error class or message, [more details here](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#similar-events)

### Problem [#problem]

```
You’ve reached the daily maximum unique time series (cardinality) limit on account xxx.  This limit will be reset at 00:00 UTC.
```

When this limit is reached, Errors inbox will no longer update and errors will seem to plateau or fall off.

### Solution [#solution]

To solve this issue, [reduce the scope of your workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads/).
