Errors inbox uses email notifications to let you know when you've been assigned to an error group.

## Email notifications [#notifications]

When an error group is assigned to your user account, New Relic sends an email with that error group's details.

Email notifications are triggered when:

* An error group is assigned and unassigned to a user.
* An error group state (unresolved, resolved, ignored) is changed, the user assigned to the error group is notified.
