Errors inbox uses email notifications to let you know when you've been assigned to an error group. 

## Email notifications [#notifications]

When an error group is assigned to your user account, New Relic sends an email with that error group's details. 

Email notifications are triggered when:

* An error group is assigned and unassigned to a user.
* An error group state (unresolved, resolved, ignored) is changed, the user assigned to the error group is notified.

Email notifications are currently sent to members of your team. If there's a new member you want to include, be sure to [invite them to the team](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2020/11/invite-teammate/). 

### Unsubscribe from email notifications [#unsubscribe]
