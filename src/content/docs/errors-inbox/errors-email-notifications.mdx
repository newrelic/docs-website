## Email notifications 
Want to be in the know when an error group has been assigned to you? We got you! When an error group is assigned to a user, the user immediately receives an email with the error group’s details*. 

Email notifications are triggered when:

* An error group is assigned and unassigned to a user.
* The state of an error group has changed. The user assigned to the error group will be notified.
