With **Group errors** tab you can dynamically filter and group errors for deeper analysis. Group errors shows you where your JavaScript errors are happening, and provides tools to help you figure out the root cause. You can also query and create dashboards of JS error data in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder), or use the browser API to monitor handled errors.

To examine JavaScript errors:
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Errors**.
2. Use the [available options in the UI](#ui-features) to examine what may be causing the errors.
3. Optional: [Review event trail ](#event-trail) or [stack traces](#stack-trace) in the UI.
4. Optional: [Query and create dashboards for JS error data](#insights) with the query builder, or [use the API](#api-logs) to monitor or log errors.

## Errors list view  [#list-view]

Start with the page loads errors chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general.
Correlate any general patterns on the top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period.
* **Dynamic grouping:** The default grouping for error occurrences is based on the error message. You have the option to change the grouping options by any attribute, up to five attributes at a time.
* **Filtering:** Many New Relic customers instrument [custom attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/collect-custom-attributes/#enabling-custom). Filtering on a specific custom attribute can be a quick way to cut through the noise of all error occurrences.

## Error profiles [#JS-profiles] 

Error profiles can help you answer questions such as: Which users are most common across all the error events in the selected time window? or which session is most common across all the error events in the selected time window?
You can download the attributes as CSV. You can also view the attributes breakdown when you select a row.

## Errors details view  [#details-view]

On this page, you can dive deep into a specific error group. The detailed view provides in-context details.
From the detailed view, you can cycle through specific error occurrences using the toggle in the upper right to navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, or any instance between.
At the top of the details page, you can inspect the **Filtered** and **Grouped By** fields to see how the information was filtered and grouped. You may receive a permalink of a specific occurrence. It's important to know the filters and group-by selections to understand the context of the occurrence.

## Occurrences tab [#error-group-occurrences]

The **Occurrences** tab includes not only error frequency, occurrence details, and stack traces, it also includes triage information. 

### Triage section [#triage-card]

<img
    title="errors inbox triage"
    alt="A screenshot depicting the triage section of the browser group errors tab."
    src={errorsinboxErrorsInboxTriageSection}
/>

The triage section links the specific error occurrence you're viewing to a [system-created error group](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#groups) that has a unique fingerprint. Why does that matter? That unique fingerprint enables you to triage an error group using a [status](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#status) update or [assignment](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#assign). The system-created error groups are the ones you find on the **Triage** tab. For more info on how they are generated, see [How error groups work](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#how-groups-work).

### Stack trace [#stack-trace]

Stack traces can show you where in the code an error is originating from to help for quicker resolution. There are different ways to make sure that the code you're viewing is unminified. You can manually upload source maps via the UI or via the API. 

### Troubleshoot missing stack traces [#troubleshoot]

Here are some reasons you don't see a stack trace for an error:
    * If errors are not thrown there won't be a stack trace. 
        - Example of a thrown errror that will NOT have a stack trace: throw `this is an error string`.
        - Example of a thrown errror that will  have a stack trace: throw new Error `this is an error string`.

    * The Javascript is hosted on a CDN or another external location, and New Relic can't see the errors originating from those scripts. This can be solved in some cases by using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
    * It is an AngularJS error. For more on this, see [Missing Angular errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/angularjs-errors-do-not-appear).
    * The error is a `SyntaxError` or `Script error`: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace.
    * Some older browsers may generate errors without a stack trace, or may provide a stack trace that is not usable.
    * You've captured the error before the New Relic agent sees it.
    * If the error occurs during multiple [harvest cycles](http://[cycle](docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#harvest-cycle)) in the same user visit, only error events reported during the first harvest cycle will have a stack trace recorded.

### Solutions for reporting stack traces [#solutions]

    * Use the [`noticeError` API call](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/notice-error).
    * Enable [development mode](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/view-detailed-error-logs-browser).
    * Use the **JS errors** UI page to get more information, including the [event trail](#event-trail). The **JS errors** page is designed to give you actionable information even without a stack trace.

### Event trail [#event-trail] 

For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable:SPA monitoring must be enabled. 
The event trail shows the browser interactions, AJAX calls, and traces that led up to a Javascript error. This can help you troubleshoot the root cause of errors.

For example, if a JS error is occurring after an AJAX request that provides an error message, it could be that your AJAX request doesn't contain the right information. This results in a JS error due to a failed AJAX call.

<img
    title="event trail errors inbox"
    alt="A screenshot depicting the event trail for errors inbox. "
    src={errorsinboxEventTrailforErrorsInbox}
/>

Here are some  reasons for events in the event log not being present:
    * **Agent version.** To capture event log data your site must have [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/install-single-page-app-monitoring-new-relic-browser) enabled (browser agent version 1071 or higher).
    * **JS error not part of a browser [interaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#interaction).** If the JS error occurs outside of an interaction, the related browser interaction details cannot be captured (for example: if an async JS file experiences an error).
    * **A click triggered the JS error.** In some cases if the error is a direct result of a click, no associated interactions are captured.
      Without event logs or stack traces, you can use the [error detail charts](#error-details) to analyze the impact the error has by browser type, device type, and URI.


## Query and visualize JS data [#insights]
New Relic saves JS errors as event data. This allows you to query your error data in the query builder. To run NRQL queries and create dashboards to view or share, query the JavaScriptError event type in the query builder.

## Global and generic errors [#js-unavailable-errors]
New Relic wraps JavaScript functions to get information about thrown errors via the stack trace. If errors aren't thrown, they won't be available. For example, if you have an AngularJS application, follow the troubleshooting procedures when [AngularJS errors do not appear](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting/angularjs-errors-do-not-appear) in the UI.
For some older browsers, the following errors may be unavailable:
* `SyntaxError` or `Script error`: These occur while the script is loading, so they do not produce a stack trace.
* In-line JavaScript or event handler errors: These are unwrapped.
* Errors thrown from third-party scripts that reside on another domain are not available.
* Errors occurring on older browsers: These may not be able to provide a usable stack trace. In some cases, they may not provide a stack trace at all.
Error collection is done by wrapping JavaScript functions, so errors thrown by the browser at a lower level (such as [cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) errors) also are not available.
