Frequent mobile app crashes degrade the user experience and cause delays in the development lifecycle. The **Group crashes** page is designed to help your development team deliver a more stable and reliable mobile app experience to your users.

With the **Group crashes** page you can:

* **Assess overall crash trends**: Review the **Crash rate percentage** and **Crash-free users **percentage charts to quickly identify any anomalies or patterns in crash occurrences.
* **Filter for deeper analysis**: Utilize groups and filters to focus on specific crash attributes, such as device type, location, or custom data points.
* **Identify patterns**: Examine the **Crash location** table for trends related to location, exception type, date, frequency, app version, and the number of affected users or devices.
* **Monitor device impact**: Track how many unique devices are affected by crashes through the **Devices impacted** metric, which is automatically collected for mobile applications.
* **Investigate individual crashes**: Select a crash report to view its interaction trail, event trail, thread details, attributes, and other relevant information. You can also resymbolicate or export the details to Xcode for debugging.
* **Update crash status**: Mark the crash as `Resolved` or choose from other status options, such as `Resolved in specific version`.

## Device impact tracking [#device-impact]

For mobile applications, New Relic automatically tracks **Devices impacted** as a key metric in the Errors inbox. This metric shows the number of unique mobile devices affected by crashes and helps you understand the scope of issues across your user base.

**Key benefits of device impact tracking:**

- **Automatic collection**: No additional configuration required - the metric is collected automatically for all mobile entities
- **Fallback metric**: When user impact data isn't available, New Relic displays devices impacted to ensure visibility into error scope
- **Prioritization**: Helps you prioritize crash fixes by showing which errors affect the most devices
- **Alerting**: You can create alerts based on devices impacted thresholds

You can query devices impacted using NRQL:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(newrelic.error.group.deviceImpact) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.deviceImpact'
```

For more details on impact metrics and alerting, see [Error scope: Users, sessions, and devices impacted](/docs/errors-inbox/error-scope-users-sessions-devices-impacted/).

## Suggested workflow [#workflow]

These steps outline our recommended approach to crash investigation, enabling you to gain a complete understanding of the alert event, identify contributing factors, and implement effective debugging strategies.

## Triage your crashes [#triage-crashes]

The triage section associates the specific error occurrence you're viewing with its [system-created error group](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#groups). These system-created error groups are identified by a unique fingerprint. It is this unique fingerprint that allows you to triage error groups by status updates or assignments.

For more info on how error groups are created, see [How error groups work](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#how-groups-work), and to learn more about status and assignments, see [Error tracking](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#assign).

## Crash attributes [#crash-attributes]

Each crash sample provides detailed information about the device environment where the crash occurred, including:

* **App version**: The specific version of the application in which the crash occurred.
* **Device type**: The model of the device on which the crash occurred.
* **OS version**: The operating system version running on the device.
* **RAM used**: The amount of memory the application was utilizing at the time of the crash.
* **Disk free**: The amount of available storage space on the device when the crash happened.
* **Attributes**: Detailed attributes associated with the crash report, offering deeper insights into the context of the crash.

You can export crash details to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code, if applicable, to streamline the troubleshooting process.

## Event trail [#event-trail]

The event trail provides a chronological log of all mobile [events](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-mobile-monitoring-custom-events-attributes/#event-definition) leading up to a crash, aiding root cause analysis. These can be events New Relic monitors by default, or custom events. The event trail is sorted chronologically, beginning with the oldest event, which is typically the app launch, but you can modify the following:

* **Sort**: Toggle between ascending and descending order.
* **Event filtering**: Filter by event type, like `interaction`, `request`, or `request error`.
* **Event details**: Expand individual events to inspect their attributes, like `responseTime`,or `requestUrl` for request events.

After you've sorted and filtered your events, you can dig a little deeper into the events that lead up to the crash by examining:

* **Custom breadcrumbs**: Utilize the [Record breadcrumb SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-breadcrumb/) to create custom `MobileBreadcrumb` events. This allows you to log specific application interactions that may be relevant to crash analysis.
* **Handled exceptions**: Use the `recordHandledException` SDK methods for iOS and Android to annotate where exceptions are handled in your application. These annotations will automatically populate the crash event trail.

For detailed guidance on enhancing crash event trails with custom data, see [Record breadcrumbs](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-breadcrumb/).

To fully leverage our crash analysis tools, make sure to:

* Use the mobile SDK to create custom `MobileBreadcrumb` or `MobileHandledException` events.
* Enable `MobileRequest` events for capturing network request data.

## Mobile stack trace [#stack-trace]

The stack trace for each crash is displayed beneath the crash details. Each frame within the stack shows the associated library or package name, and method. For each crash, the mobile agent attempts to detect the specific stack frame containing the programming error responsible for the crash. If successfully detected, that stack frame appears red.

* **iOS apps**: Source code method names and line numbers are visible if you have uploaded the corresponding dSYM files for each build.
* **Android apps using ProGuard**: Package and method names will be de-obfuscated if ProGuard map uploading is enabled.
* **Android native crash reports**: These reports will only display source filenames and relative code offsets.

You can use [email alerts](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/mobile-monitoring-email-notifications/) to promptly respond to new crashes.

## Android-native crash reporting [#android-native-reporting]

[New Relic Android agent version 6.7.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-670), introduced enhancements to help track and diagnose native crashes, reporting, and analysis. These enhancements include signal violations and other faults that occur at the [native code](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides) level during runtime.

These enhancements include:

* **Native crash reports**: Signal violations and other crashes reported by the app during runtime, including:
  * Signal 4: Illegal instruction
  * Signal 6: Abnormal termination
  * Signal 7: Bus error/bad memory access
  * Signal 8: Floating-point exception
  * Signal 1: Segmentation violation/invalid memory reference

* **Native runtime exceptions**: The native agent will report any unhandled C++ exceptions thrown by the app during runtime, and report them as [handled exceptions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/introduction-mobile-handled-exceptions/). Unhandled exceptions are usually fatal and will crash the application.

<Callout variant="important">
  Native crash reporting is an incubating feature. Native crash monitoring is difficult at best, but the agent will make all best-attempts to detect and report these conditions. It may miss or incompletely report some conditions, and there may be latency viewing these conditions in the application dashboard.

  Symbolication of native symbols will not be supported in early NDK agent releases. When native symbols for an app are not present, the stack trace produced by a crash consists only of these obfuscated labels, which are not easily readable.
</Callout>

You can view detailed information about native crashes in New Relic Mobile's [<DNT>**Crash analysis**</DNT> UI](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes), or receive crash notifications by [email](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/receive-crash-notifications-email). You can also explore the crash data deeper with [New Relic Insights](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/crash-analysis-group-filter-your-crashes#insights), or [integrate with ticketing systems](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/file-tickets-mobile-app-crashes) for further investigation.

## Troubleshooting  [#profiles-disabled]

Keep in mind that profiles are disabled when there are no statistically significant differences between attributes values of crashed and crash-free sessions or there are no profiles available that match the applied filters.
