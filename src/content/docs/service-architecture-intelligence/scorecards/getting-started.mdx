### Rule View [#rule-view]

Rules are the building blocks of Scorecards, containing specific performance conditions. The rule view allows users to assess and manage individual rules.
In this view you can view a list of all rules and their details including a description, NRQL statement, and scope. Evaluate entities against these rules to determine compliance.

For more information to:

* Create rules, refer [Create Scorecard rules](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/managing-scorecards/#create-scorecard-rules).
* Manage rules, refer [Manage rules](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/managing-scorecards/#update-rule). 



### Teams View [#teams-view]

The Teams view aggregates Scorecards data at the team level, providing a team-centric perspective of compliance and performance. In the Teams view:

* Each team's score is calculated as the average of associated Scorecards, offering a quick view of adherence to standards.
* Performance status is categorized by color or label, such as Good, Below Goal, and Need Attention, to signal areas requiring attention.
