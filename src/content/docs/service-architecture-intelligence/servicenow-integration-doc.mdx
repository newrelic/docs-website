<Callout title="PREVIEW">

    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


Are you looking to enhance your understanding of service architecture by utilizing data from your ServiceNow account? The New Relic ServiceNow integration seamlessly imports user, team, and role data directly into the New Relic platform.

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams, simplifies role management, and clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing setup configuration time and effort. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, see the [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started). 


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* Admin access to your ServiceNow instance
* Necessary permissions to create properties, users, roles, ACLs, and scripts

## Set up the ServiceNow integration

The integration requires configuration in both ServiceNow and New Relic. First, configure your ServiceNow instance to enable the integration and allow New Relic to access and retrieve the necessary data.

### Configure ServiceNow

Complete the following steps in your ServiceNow instance:

1. **Create Properties in ServiceNow.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_properties.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, provide a name (e.g., **glide.oauth.inbound.client.credential.grant_type.enabled**), set the type to **True/False**, and set the value to `True`, and submit the property.

2. **Create a service user.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_user.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New** and set the user name (e.g., New Relic Service User).
    
    3. Ensure the user is active, enable **Web Service Access Only**, and submit the user.

3. **Create a role.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_user_role.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the role name (e.g., New Relic Service Role), and submit the role.

4. **Create Access Control List (ACL).**

    1. Navigate to `sys_security_acl.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the name (e.g., New Relic Service ACL), and select the type as **record**.
    
    3. Set the operation to **read** and select the table as `sys_user_role`.
    
    4. In the **Requires role** field, select the role created in step 3.
    
    5. Create similar ACL role for `sys_user_grmember` and repeat the steps.
    
    6. Submit the ACL.

5. **Assign role to service user.**

    1. Navigate to the service user created in `sys_user.list`.
    
    2. Edit the user roles to add the role created earlier.
    
    3. Save the changes to ensure the service user has the necessary permissions.

6. **Configure application registry.**

    1. Navigate to `oauth_application_registry.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New** and select **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.
    
    3. Set the name (e.g., **NR OAuth Client**), set **Default Grant Type** to **Client Credentials**, and set **OAuth Application User** to the service user you created.
    
    4. Submit the application registry to establish secure communication.

7. **Create signing key property.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_properties.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the type to **Password2**, set the name (e.g., **nr_signing_key_real_time_events**), and set the value to a unique **UUID**.
    
    3. Submit the property to store the unique identifier securely.

8. **Create an HTTP method.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_rest_message.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New** to create a REST message and set the name and endpoint.
    
    3. Submit the REST message.
    
    4. Create an HTTP method by:
        - Setting the authentication type to **No Authentication**.
        - Specifying the endpoint.
        - Setting the method to **POST**.
        - Submitting the method.

9. **Configure REST message endpoints.**

    1. In the HTTP method you created, specify the New Relic endpoint URL where ServiceNow will send the real-time events.
    
    2. Ensure the endpoint configuration matches your New Relic integration requirements.

10. **Create business rule automation.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_script.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the name, set **When to run** to **After**, and set **Insert, Update, Delete**.
    
    3. Set the table to `sys_user_group`, paste the following script, replace the property name in the script if necessary, and submit the business rule.
     ```javascript
    (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
        try {
            var signingKeyProp = gs.getProperty('nr_rt_event_signing_key');

            if (!signingKeyProp) {
                gs.log('Error: cant get signing key from sys props');
            }

            var signingKey = GlideStringUtil.base64Encode(signingKeyProp);

            if (!signingKey) {
                gs.log('Error: base64 signing key is empty');
            }

            var payload = {};
            var tableName = current.getTableName();

            for (var fieldName in current) {
                if (current.getElement(fieldName) && typeof current[fieldName] !== 'function') {
                    payload[fieldName] = current.getValue(fieldName);
                }
            }

            payload.instance_name = gs.getProperty('instance_name');
            payload.event_type = current.operation();
            payload.event_timestamp = new Date().toISOString();

            var jsonPayload = JSON.stringify(payload);
            var mac = new GlideCertificateEncryption;
            var signingAlgo = 'HmacSHA256';

            var signature = mac.generateMac(signingKey, signingAlgo, jsonPayload);

            var r = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2('nr_rt_rest_message', 'post_nr_rt_message');
            r.setRequestBody(jsonPayload);
            r.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
            r.setRequestHeader('X-NR-Signature-Key', signature);
            if (tableName) {
                r.setRequestHeader('X-NR-Data-Type', tableName);
            } else {
                gs.log('Error: Table name could not be determined for X-NR-Data-Type header.');
            }
            var response = r.execute();
            var httpStatus = response.getStatusCode();
            var responseBody = response.getBody();

            if (httpStatus >= 200 && httpStatus < 300) {
                gs.log('success status : ' + httpStatus);
            } else {
                gs.log('failure status : ' + httpStatus + ' reason : ' + responseBody);
            }
        } catch (ex) {
            gs.log('Error happened: ' + ex.getMessage());
        }
    })(current, previous);    
    ```

This script captures changes to the `sys_user_group` table and sends real-time events to New Relic, including the operation type (insert, update, delete) and the relevant data.

11. **Finalize ServiceNow configuration.**

    1. Collect the following information from your ServiceNow configuration:
        - Client ID and Client Secret from the application registry
        - Instance name (e.g., `google`)
        - Real-time signing key (UUID you created)
    
    <Callout variant="important">
    **UUID length requirement**: New Relic requires a minimum length of 16 characters for the UUID signing key. Ensure your generated UUID meets this requirement for successful integration.
    </Callout>
    
    2. Test the configuration by validating that teams and users data can be retrieved correctly.

## Complete setup in New Relic

On the New Relic platform, complete the following steps to finalize the integration:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > ServiceNow integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.

2. In the **Set up ServiceNow integration** screen, enter the following details:

    - **Client ID**: The Client ID from the application registry.
    - **Client Secret**: The Client Secret from the application registry.
    - **ServiceNow instance name**: The name of your ServiceNow instance (e.g., `google.servicenow.com`).
    - **Real-time events signing key**: The UUID created in the ServiceNow instance.

3. Click **Continue** to establish the connection between New Relic and ServiceNow.
