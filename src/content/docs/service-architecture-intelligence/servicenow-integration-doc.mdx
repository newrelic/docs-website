<Callout title="PREVIEW">

    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).

Are you aiming to enhance your understanding of service architecture by utilizing data from your ServiceNow account? The New Relic ServiceNow integration seamlessly imports user, team, and role data directly into the New Relic platform.

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams, simplifies role management, and clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing the setup configuration, time, and effort. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started). 


**Prerequisites:**

* Admin access to ServiceNow instance.
* Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create properties, users, roles, ACLs, and scripts.


**To set up the Servicenow integration:**

On the ServiceNow instance, you need to create a system property to enable the integration. This property allows New Relic to access the ServiceNow instance and retrieve the necessary data. 

On the ServiceNow instance, do the following steps to set up the integration:

1. **Create Properties in ServiceNow.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_properties.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, provide a name (e.g., **glide.oauth.inbound.client.credential.grant_type.enabled**), set the type to **True/False**, and set the value to `True`, and submit the property.

2. **Create Service user.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_user.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Navigate to `sys_user.list`, click **New**, set the user name (e.g., New Relic Service User), 
    
    3. Ensure that the user is active, enable Web **Service Access Only**, and submit the user.

3. **Create Roles.**
    1. Navigate to `sys_user_role.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the role name (e.g., New Relic Service Role), and submit the role.

4. **Create Access Control List (ACL).**

    1. Navigate to `sys_security_acl.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the name (e.g., New Relic Service ACL), and select the type as **record**.
    
    3. Set the operation to **read** and select the table as `sys_user_role`.
    
    4. In the **Requires role** field, select the role created in step 3.
    5. Create similar ACL role for `sys_user_grmember` and repeat the steps.
     
    6. Submit the ACL.

5. **Assign Role to Service User.**

    1. Navigate to the service user created in the `sys_user.list`.
    
    2. Edit the user roles to add the role created earlier.
    
    3. Save the changes to ensure the service user has the necessary permissions.

6. **Configure Application Registry.**

    1. Navigate to `oauth_application_registry.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, select **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.
    
    3. Set the name (e.g., **NR OAuth Client**), set **Default Grant Type** to **Client Credentials**, and set **OAuth Application User** to the service user created.
    
    4. Submit the application registry to establish secure communication.

7. **Create Signing Key Property.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_properties.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the type to **Password2**, set the name (e.g., **nr_signing_key_real_time_events**), and set the value to a unique **UUID**.
    
    3. Submit the property to store the unique identifier securely.

8. **Define RESTful Communication.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_rest_message.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the name and endpoint for the REST message, and submit it.
    
9. **Create an HTTP Method**

    1. Navigate to `sys_rest_message.list` using the filter.
    2. Click **New** to create a REST message and set the name and endpoint.
    3. Submit the REST message.
    4. Create an HTTP method by:
        - Setting the authentication type to **No Authentication**.
        - Specifying the endpoint.
        - Setting the method to **POST**.
        - Submitting the method.
9. **Automate Business Rule.**

    1. Navigate to `sys_script.list` using the filter.
    
    2. Click **New**, set the name, set **When to run** to **After**, and set **Insert, Update, Delete**.
    
    3. Set the table to `sys_user_group`, paste the provided script, replace the property name in the script if necessary, and submit the business rule.

10. **Finalize Integration.**

    1. Provide the Client ID and Client Secret from the application registry, the instance name (e.g., `google`), and the real-time signing key (UUID created).
    
    2. Validate that teams and users data are being pulled correctly to ensure successful integration.
    
On the New relic platform, do the following steps to complete the set up integration:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > ServiceNow integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. In the **Set up ServiceNow integration** screen, enter the following details:

    - **Client ID**: The Client ID from the application registry.
    - **Client Secret**: The Client Secret from the application registry.
    - **ServiceNow instnce name**: The name of your ServiceNow instance (e.g., `google.servicenow.com`).
    - **Real-time events signing key**: The UUID created in the ServiceNow instance.

3. Click **Continue** to establish the connection between New Relic and ServiceNow.
