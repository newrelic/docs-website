New Relic <DNT>Catalog</DNT> offers a single pane view to enhance the observability and management of software systems in your organization. The unified view of system entities facilitates well-informed decision-making, streamlined operations, and improved collaboration across teams.

## Personalize the view [#personalized-view]

By default, the <DNT>Catalog</DNT> page displays the entity from Teams associated with your user account. However, you can further customize the <DNT>Catalog</DNT> page to add or remove filters and columns based on your preferences. This allows you to focus on the most relevant content and streamline your workflows.

    <img
            title="Filters in Catalog"
            alt="Filters in Catalog"
            src={CatalogFilters}
    />

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

## Limitations [#limitations]

* No support for sorting data in the <DNT>Catalog</DNT> page.


## Back to All Entities [#back-entities]

The new Catalog view replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> capability from the navigation. If you need to find entity types other than the supported entities in the <DNT>Catalog</DNT>, use the <DNT>Quick Find `(cmd + K or ctrl+K)`</DNT> global search, or find them in their corresponding capabilities, such as Infrastructure, Synthetics, Workloads, Service Levels, and more.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Tip">
