The <DNT>Repository Catalog</DNT> is a tool designed to centralize and streamline the management of repositories within an organization. By providing a unified view of all repositories, it enhances cross-team collaboration and simplifies the discovery, access, and management of code repositories. 

The <DNT>Repository Catalog</DNT> is designed to break silos between teams and increase cross-team collaboration. It enables developers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and other stakeholders to efficiently identify existing repositories, understand their purpose, and determine ownership or status. This centralized approach leads to improved collaboration, accountability, and productivity across the organization.


## Key features [#features]

-  **Centralized Repository Discovery:** Quickly identify repositories relevant to services, projects, or <DNT>[Teams](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/teams/teams)</DNT>, <DNT>[Scorecards](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/scorecards)</DNT>, minimizing the time spent searching or consulting with colleagues.

-  **Service and Repository Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate from applications or services to their defining repositories and vice versa, aiding in understanding code dependencies and infrastructure.

-  **Ownership and Accountability:** Easily identify repository owners, supporting direct queries and enhancing accountability within teams.

- **Repository Insights:** Access detailed metrics on repository activity, such as commits, open pull requests, and deployment history, to identify neglected projects and optimize resource allocation.

- **Management and Operations:** Perform bulk operations, such as assigning tags or teams, to efficiently manage repositories and maintain organizational standards.



## Getting started [#getting-started]

The <DNT>Catalog</DNT> page replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> page once available. To go back to <DNT>All Entities</DNT> page, refer [Back to All Entities](#back-entities).

**To integrate the catalogs inventory:**

1. Log in to your New Relic platform.
2. Go to the **left navigation pane > All Capabilities > Catalog**.
3. Click the **Repository** tab.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the on-boarding. 
    After you complete the boarding, the Catalog page replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> page.
