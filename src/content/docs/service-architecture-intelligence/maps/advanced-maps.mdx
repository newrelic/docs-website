<DNT>**Maps**</DNT> provides a unified and integrated view of your cloud estate, allowing seamless navigation and exploration of services and infrastructure. It integrates tracing, infrastructure, and performance data into a cohesive experience, addressing limitations of the <DNT>**[Service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/service-maps/)**</DNT> experiences.

* **Comprehensive visualization**: View your entire digital landscape that shows all your services and infrastructure in one place. This visualization helps you quickly grasp complex architectures and make informed decisions about your cloud environment.

* **Automatic Resource Detection**: With [auto-discovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities/), Maps automatically identifies new resources and their relationships. This feature ensures your data is always current, reducing the time and effort needed to manually update and track changes in your cloud estate.

<Callout variant="important">
  <DNT>**Maps**</DNT> with [<DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) and [<DNT>**Auto-Discovery**</DNT>](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities) provides unified relationships between entities. While <DNT>**Maps**</DNT> remains functional even if you haven't enabled <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT> or <DNT>**Auto-Discovery**</DNT>, enabling these features is recommended for a more impactful and consistent experience.
</Callout>


## Use <DNT>**Maps**</DNT> [#use-maps]

With the features and components of <DNT>**Maps**</DNT>, you can explore and manage your cloud environment in the following ways:

  <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="health-status"
      title="Manage node visibility using health status"
      >
      The Health status summary provides a quick overview of all nodes. Each health status is represented by a color legend, with a number next to each legend indicating the count of nodes in that status. This allows you to quickly assess and address areas needing attention.
         <img
          title="color-code"
          alt="color-code"
          src="/images/color-code.webp"
          /> 

      <Callout variant="tip">
      In the <DNT>**Map View Settings**</DNT> panel, green represents operational nodes for health status filtering, and the green legend at the bottom-left of the map provides their count. However, on the map, operational nodes do not have a green dot, as this is considered the default state of a node.
</Callout>

    ### Instrument the uninstrumented nodes [#node-instrumentation] 

          If there are any uninstrumented nodes in the map, they appear with a dotted border. To instrument a particular uninstrumented node, point to the node, click <DNT>**Instrument**</DNT>, and follow the on-screen instructions.

          You can also get the list of all uninstrumented nodes in the map and instrument them as follows:
          1. From the health status summary of the map, point to <DNT>**Uninstrumented**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Instrument what's missing**</DNT>.
          2. On the <DNT>**Add more instrumentation**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions to instrument each entity.

          After you instrument the nodes, the map refreshes to show the updated health status.

    ### Filter nodes by health status [#node-filtering]

          If you want to focus on some nodes with specific health categories, filter the nodes as follows. 
          1. To open the <DNT>**Map View Settings**</DNT> panel, from the top-right of the map, click **Settings**.
          2. From the <DNT>**Health Status**</DNT> list, select the specific status you want to view. The map view updates to show only the nodes with the selected health status.

### Manage clusters with health status [#cluster-health-status]

  If clusters are available in your map view, you can filter nodes in it by health status and display them separately. Point to a cluster and reveal the health status to show nodes with that status outside the cluster. This helps you focus on specific nodes within the cluster.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="group-services"
      title="Group nodes to organize the map view"
      >
      You can group nodes in the map to reduce clutter and highlight relationships, making it easier to identify patterns and manage dependencies. This structured approach provides a clear and organized view of your cloud environment, tailored to your specific needs.

      ### Create groups [#create-groups]

      1. To organize nodes by a specific attribute in the map, go to the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down and select the attribute.
      2. To get the grouping on the map, click <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. Each group displays the number of nodes it contains.
      3. To add another level to the group, from the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down, click <DNT>**+ Create a group**</DNT> > select an attribute > <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. The first level attribute forms the primary group, and the second level attribute forms sub-groups nested in the primary group. You can apply up to five levels of grouping.

      #### Group appearance and naming [#group-appearance]

      Groups are named based on the selected attribute. For example, if you are grouping the nodes by the `Account` attribute, the group name appears as `Account: <account name>`. Groups are color-coded according to the health status of the nodes within them, as follows:
      * **Red**: At least one critical node
      * **Yellow**: At least one degraded node but no critical nodes

      Select a group to view the details of the grouped entities in a table at the right panel. You can also expand groups to view the nodes and nested sub-groups within them. As per your requirement you can reorder group levels by shuffling attributes in the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down.
