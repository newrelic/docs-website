## Use <DNT>**Maps**</DNT> [#use-maps]

With the features and components of <DNT>**Maps**</DNT>, you can explore and manage your cloud environment in the following ways:

  <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="health-status"
      title="Manage node visibility using health status"
      >
      The Health status summary provides a quick overview of all nodes. Each health status is represented by a color legend, with a number next to each legend indicating the count of nodes in that status. This allows you to quickly assess and address areas needing attention.
         <img
          title="color-code"
          alt="color-code"
          src="/images/color-code.webp"
          /> 

        ### Instrument the uninstrumented nodes [#node-instrumentation] 

          If there are any uninstrumented nodes in the map, they appear with a dotted border. After you instrument the nodes, the map refreshes to show the updated health status.

          To instrument nodes:
          1. From the health status summary of the map, point to <DNT>**Uninstrumented**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Instrument what's missing**</DNT>.
          2. On the <DNT>**Add more instrumentation**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions to instrument each entity.


        ### Filter nodes by health status [#node-filtering]

          If you want to focus on some nodes with specific health categories, filter the nodes as follows. 
          1. To open the <DNT>**Map View Settings**</DNT> panel, from the top-right of the map, click **Settings**.
          2. From the <DNT>**Health Status**</DNT> list, select the specific status you want to view. The map view updates to show only the nodes with the selected health status.

### Manage clusters with health status [#cluster-health-status]

  If clusters are available in your map view, you can filter nodes in it by health status and display them separately. Point to a cluster and reveal the health status to show nodes with that status outside the cluster. This helps you focus on specific nodes within the cluster.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="group-services"
      title="Group nodes to organize the map view"
      >
      You can group nodes in the map to reduce clutter and highlight relationships, making it easier to identify patterns and manage dependencies. This structured approach provides a clear and organized view of your cloud environment, tailored to your specific needs.

      ### Create groups [#create-groups]

      1. To organize nodes by a specific attribute in the map, go to the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down and select the attribute.
      2. To get the grouping on the map, click <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. Each group displays the number of nodes it contains.
      3. To add another level to the group, from the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down, click <DNT>**+ Create a group**</DNT> > select an attribute > <DNT>**Apply**</DNT>. The first level attribute forms the primary group, and the second level attribute forms sub-groups nested in the primary group. You can apply up to five levels of grouping.

      #### Group appearance and naming [#group-appearance]

      Groups are named based on the selected attribute. For example, if you are grouping the nodes by the `Account` attribute, the group name appears as `Account: <account name>`. Groups are color-coded according to the health status of the nodes within them, as follows:
      * **Red**: At least one critical node
      * **Yellow**: At least one degraded node but no critical nodes
      * **Green**: All nodes are operational

      You can expand groups to view the nodes and nested sub-groups within them. As per your requirement you can reorder group levels by shuffling attributes in the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> drop-down.


    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="map-navigation"
      title="Navigate on the map to explore node details, relationships, and dependencies"
      >
      <DNT>**Maps**</DNT> provides several features to help you explore relationships, dependencies, and metric and team details of an entity. When you point to a node on the map, a pop-over appears with the following interaction options, and three golden metrics. You can use these options to navigate and explore the map further.


      ### Expand dependency [#expand-dependency]

      To view the dependent nodes of any node on the map, point to the node and click <DNT>**Expand dependencies**</DNT>. That node becomes the focal node, revealing all one depth away dependent nodes with connected edges.

      ### Inspect infrastructure resources [#inspect-resources]

      To view the infrastructure resources associated with a node, point to the node and click <DNT>**Inspect Infrastructure**</DNT>. The infrastructure map opens, displaying the associated infrastructure nodes and their internal relationship two depths away from the APM service. If you have enabled for the <DNT>**[Auto-Discovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities)**</DNT> feature, you can view the internal relationships between AWS services.

      ### View dynamic flow [#view-data-flow]

      To view the data flow through your node, including interactions with databases and other backend components, point to a node and click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT>. The dynamic flow map opens, providing a detailed view of data flow through the node, including interactions with databases and other backend components. For more details, refer [<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/dynamic-flow-map).

      ### Access node owner [#access-node-owner]

      To access the owner of a node, point to the node and click the team name. The team page opens, displaying the team details and the entities owned by the team.

      ### Access the node details [#access-node-details]

      To view and adjust details of a node, point to the node and click the node name. The entity summary page opens, displaying the entity details.




    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
      id="bypass-gateways"
      title="Bypass gateways to reveal actual nodes"
      >
      In <DNT>**Maps**</DNT>, gateways can mask the true entities that your focal node connects with. To visualize the actual node instead of the gateway, you can manually establish a bypass call relationship.

      To set up a bypass call relationship:
      1. On the map, select the gateway node that you want to bypass. The names of the gateway nodes start with `Gateway:`.
      2. On the right panel, under the <DNT>**Tags**</DNT> section, add the `service_gateway: true` tag.
      3. To apply the changes, refresh the map. The actual node replaces the gateway node, allowing you to view the bypass call relationship between the focal node and the actual node.
