<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> is a visualization tool that displays aggregated trace data in a map view. It focuses on a specific service (called the focal node) and reveals how performance changes in upstream and downstream services affect each other. By highlighting anomalous latency and errors in traffic between services, the map helps you quickly identify performance bottlenecks and trace issues to their root cause.

## Why it matters [#why-it-matters]

<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> reduces mean time to resolution by surfacing performance anomalies visually. Instead of manually analyzing traces to understand service relationships, you can see at a glance which services are experiencing issues and how those issues correlate with the focal node. The color-coded visualization of anomalous edges and nodes lets you quickly identify where latency or errors are occurring in your distributed system.

To get familiar with map components and features, refer [<DNT>**Maps**</DNT>](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps).

<Callout variant="important">
 [<DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) is required for the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> to work, and it is enabled by default for all APM agents. If data is not visible, ensure <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT> is active for the focal node and associated entities, and verify that tracing data appears in New Relic.

## Access the Dynamic Flow Map [#explore-dynamic-flow-map]

You can access the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> from multiple locations in New Relic:

### From service maps

1. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>, open any [service, infrastructure, or team map](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps).
2. Hover over any entity node on the map.
3. Click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT> (the traces icon).

The unified map experience switches from the service map to the dynamic flow map. To return to the service map, click the close button on the dynamic flow map chiclet.

### From transaction features

Access the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> from transaction-focused views:

* **Transaction details page**: The dynamic flow map loads automatically, showing the services involved in that transaction.
* **[Transactions 360](/docs/apm/transactions/workload-performance-monitoring/transaction-workloads/)**: The dynamic flow map displays the services participating in the transaction and the time taken by each service.

<Callout variant="tip">
In transaction-focused views, the performance by transactions table is hidden because the view is already focused on a single transaction. However, when you navigate to other features from these views, the transaction filter is passed along so you can continue your focused analysis.

The <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> shows relationships between the focal node and surrounding entities. Upstream services are represented with edges pointing towards the focal node, while downstream services have edges pointing away from it. You can interact with the map to view performance trends, anomalies, and other details as follows:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="anomalies" title="Analyze anomalies">
 The map displays anomalies using color-coded edges and dots:

 **Edge colors** (showing anomalous traffic between services):
 * **Blue edge**: Latency anomaly detected in traffic between the services.
 * **Pink edge**: Error anomaly detected in traffic between the services.
 * **Blue and pink striped edge**: Both latency and error anomalies detected in traffic between the services.

 **Dots beside nodes** (showing anomalies within a service):
 * **Blue dot**: The service is experiencing latency anomalies.
 * **Pink dot**: The service is experiencing error anomalies.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you see a node with an anomaly dot but the connecting edge isn't color-coded, the anomalies aren't correlated. This happens because edge colors and node dots are calculated independently. Check the [performance trends](#performance-trends) to see if the anomalies occurred at different times.
</Callout>

 ### Filter anomalies by type

 Use the interactive legend at the top of the map to focus on specific anomaly types:
 1. Click **Latency** in the legend to show only latency anomalies (removes error indicators from view).
 2. Click **Errors** in the legend to show only error anomalies (removes latency indicators from view).

 This filtering helps you remove noise when you want to focus on one type of performance issue.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="clusters" title="Work with clustered entities">
 To keep your map organized, the map automatically groups entities with low anomaly scores into clusters.

 To view and manage entities within a cluster:
 1. Click on a cluster node to open the right panel.
 2. The panel displays a list of all entities in that cluster.
 3. Toggle the visibility of entities:
    * **Unhide an entity**: Click to unhide an entity from the list. The entity separates from the cluster and appears individually on the map.
    * **Hide an entity**: Click to hide an entity that's currently visible. The entity returns to the cluster.
    * You can unhide one, two, or all entities from a cluster as needed.

 This approach gives you a concise map view initially while still letting you access and display specific entities when needed.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="performance-trends" title="View detailed entity information">
 When you click an entity on the map, a sidebar opens showing detailed information about that entity and its relationship to the focal node.

 The sidebar helps you:
 * **Access related pages**: Use header links to navigate to the entity's APM page or owning team page.
 * **Analyze performance**: Review time series charts showing tracing metrics for both the selected entity and focal node. Anomaly badges appear on charts when the entity has performance issues.
 * **Investigate transactions**: See which transactions involve the focal entity and access detailed transaction information.
 * **View traces**: Click **View traces** to open the tracing homepage with filters for the focal node and selected entity already applied.
 * **Manage ownership**: Assign entities to specific teams.
 * **Manage tags**: View and add tags to the selected entity.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="investigate-issues" title="View traces for deeper investigation">
 After identifying performance issues on the map, you can investigate the underlying traces. The <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> provides following two buttons that open the tracing homepage with different filter combinations:

 **View traces button on the main map**: Opens the tracing homepage with all filters currently applied to the map (entity filters, transaction filters, time range).

 **View traces button in the sidebar**: Opens the tracing for the entity currently selected, with all map filters.

 Both options help you quickly move from visual anomaly detection to detailed trace analysis, making it easier to identify root causes and take corrective action.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="multi-select-mode" title="Filter by multiple entities">
 Use multi-select mode to focus the map on traces that flow through specific entities.

 To filter by multiple entities:
 1. Click the cursor icon in the top right corner to enter multi-select mode.
 2. Click the entities you want to include. A sidebar tracks your selections.
 3. Click **Apply** to redraw the map showing only traces that pass through both the focal node and your selected entities.

 In multi-select mode:
 * You can select individual entities only. Clusters cannot be added.
 * The focal node always remains in the filter and cannot be removed.
 * You can combine entity filters with transaction filters for more focused analysis.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="filter-by-transaction" title="Filter by transaction">
 Use the performance by transactions table to focus the map on a specific transaction.

 To filter by transaction:
 1. Review the time series data for each transaction associated with the focal entity in the table.
 2. Click **Generate map** next to the transaction you want to analyze.
 3. The map redraws to show only traces that include that transaction name.

 When filtering by transaction:
 * Only one transaction filter can be applied at a time.
 * You can switch between transactions by clicking **Generate map** for a different transaction.
 * Transaction filters work together with entity filters for deeper analysis.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="time-picker" title="Understand time window limitations">
 Some instances of the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> include the platform time picker, but the query window is limited to a maximum of 3 hours.

 **How the time limitation works**:
 * If you select a time window longer than 3 hours, the map automatically uses the most recent 3 hours within that window.
 * A notification appears at the bottom of the map indicating:
   * The actual time range being displayed
   * A note that the maximum time window available was applied

 This ensures you see the most recent and relevant data while maintaining optimal map performance.
