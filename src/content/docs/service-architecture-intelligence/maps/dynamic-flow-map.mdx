<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy). 
</Callout>

<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> is a visualization tool that provides a map view of aggregated trace data. It highlights performance signals related to a specific service, called focal node. The map uses tracing data to display relationships between services participating in traces with the focal node, correlating performance changes across upstream and downstream entities. This helps identify performance bottlenecks in applications and services, aiding in pinpointing the root cause.

## Why it matters [#why-it-matters]

<DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> helps in reducing the mean time to resolution by allowing you to visualize and identify performance anomalies. By correlating upstream and downstream tracing performance data, it helps you understand how different services interact and affect each other's performance.

To get familiar with map components and features, refer [<DNT>**Maps**</DNT>](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps).

<Callout variant="important">
 [<DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) is required for the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> to work, and it is enabled by default for all APM agents. If data is not visible, ensure <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT> is active for the focal node and associated entities, and verify that tracing data appears in New Relic.

## Explore the Dynamic Flow Map [#explore-dynamic-flow-map]

To access the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>:

1. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**</DNT>, open any [service, infrastructure, or team map](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps).
2. To open the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, point to a node and click <DNT>**View dynamic flow**</DNT>.

You can also access <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> from [<DNT>**Transactions 360**</DNT>](/docs/apm/transactions/workload-performance-monitoring/transaction-workloads/). You can view the map of a particular transaction showing the services involved and the time taken by each service.

The <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT> shows relationships between the focal node and surrounding entities. Upstream services are represented with edges pointing towards the focal node, while downstream services have edges pointing away from it. You can interact with the map to view performance trends, anomalies, and other details as follows:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="anomalies" title="Analyze anomalies">
 The anomalies are displayed with color-coded edges and dots next to the service nodes, as follows:
 * **Blue edge**: Latency issue between the services.
 * **Red edge**: Signal error between the services.
 * **Blue and red striped edge**: Both latency issue and signal error between the services.
 * **Blue dot beside a service node**: Latency issue in the service.
 * **Red dot beside a service node**: Signal error in the service.

If a node has anomaly dots beside it, but the edge connecting it to the focal node is not color-coded, it indicates that anomalies between the nodes are not correlated. From the [performance trends](#performance-trends), you can review the metrics time series chart to confirm that the anomalies occurred at different times for the nodes.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="performance-trends" title="View performance trends">
 On the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, to view the performance trends between the focal node and a connected node, click the surrounding one. The performance trends between the nodes appear in the right panel, showing the metrics time series graphs.

 You can analyze the performance trends and manage the nodes as follows:
 * Identify patterns between your selected nodes.
 * Interact with the time series charts by selecting the nodes under it.
 * View all traces between the selected nodes.
 * Assign ownership of nodes to specific teams.
 * Add tags to the nodes.

</Collapser>
<Collapser id="investigate-issues" title="Investigate issues">
 On the <DNT>**Dynamic Flow Map**</DNT>, after identifying a node with performance issues correlated to the focal node, you can investigate the traces between them. To view the traces, from the right panel, click **See all traces**. By analyzing the traces, you can identify the root cause of the performance issues and take necessary actions to resolve them.
