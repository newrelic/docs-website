## Who can access Teams? [#teams-permissions]

To ensure that all users can always identify team ownership, Teams will be managed at the organizational level rather than at the account level.

* **Read Access: **All users have read access to Teams, including metadata such as contact information, team members, and other relevant details.
* **Modify Teams: **Users with the **Organization Product Admin** role can modify Teams. This is a new role assigned to all users who currently have the **All Product Admin role**.
* **Create & Delete Teams: **Users with **Administrative settings** or **Organization Manager** or **Authentication Manager** roles can create and delete Teams.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Tip">

To enable additional users to create and delete Teams without granting them the Organization Manager or Authentication Manager roles, you can create a [custom role](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-groups/#create-role). Please ensure that the permissions are scoped to your org and not to an account.

## Create Teams [#create-teams]

{/* You have three options for creating Teams in the UI: manually, from existing user groups or from your GitHub teams.  */}

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you prefer to create Teams programmatically, you can also create Teams with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-teams-tutorial).
</Callout>

### Create a Team manually [#create-manually]

We recommend this option if you don't already have Team and service ownership data elsewhere.

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Teams**.
2. Click **Build manually**.
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to start the manual process"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to start the manual process"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_create-manually.webp"
    />
3. Enter a team name.
4. Add a description and an aliases for your team (optional).
5. Add team members (optional).
6. Click **Create team**.

### Create Teams from user groups [#create-from-groups]

We recommend this option if you want to keep your Teams synchronized with your existing New Relic user groups.

If your group names follow a recognizable pattern that distinguishes Teams, you can fully automate the synchronization. Otherwise, manually select the groups you want to create as teams.

Make sure you're assigned a user role that includes `authentication_domain.read.groups` permissions, and then complete these steps:


1. Go to **All Capabilities > Teams**.
2. Click **Start with New Relic groups**.
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to start with groups"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to start with groups"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_start-with-groups.webp"
    />
3. Select if you want to **Automate with a rule** or **Select groups manually**
  {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing options to start with groups"
        alt="Screenshot showing options to start with groups"
        src="/images/teams_usergroups_selection.webp"
    /> */}

**Option 1: Automate with a rule**

1. Add a rule to recognize the groups to create as teams, and click **Create rule**.
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to add a rule"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to add a rule"
        src="/images/teams_usergroups_createrule.webp"
    /> */}
2. Click **See teams**
     {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to add a rule"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to add a rule"
        src="/images/teams_usergroups_createrule_seeteams.webp"
    /> */}
    From now on, the creation, updatation and deletion of Teams are in synchronization within your user groups. 

**Option 2: Manual group selection**
1. Select the user groups you want to create as Teams, and click **Next**.
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to select groups"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to select groups"
        src="/images/teams_usergroups_manual.webp"
    />

    After you finish creating Teams, you're returned to the **Overview** page.

{/* <img
    title="Screenshot showing the teams overview page"
    alt="Screenshot showing the teams overview page"
    src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_teams-overview-page.webp"
/> */}

 ### Create Teams from GitHub teams [#create-from-github]

We recommend this option if you want to keep your New Relic teams synchronized with your existing GitHub teams.

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Teams**.
2. Click **GitHub teams, repos & users**. You will be redirected to the GitHub integration configuration page.

<img
    title="Screenshot showing the GitHub option"
    alt="Screenshot showing the GitHub option"
    src="/images/create_teams_github.webp"
/> 

### Create Teams automatically from Your identity provider

To streamline team management and align New Relic with your organizational structure, you can automatically create and sync teams from your identity provider (IdP), such as Okta or Active Directory. Do the following to set up automatic team creation from your IdP:

1. Set Up Groups in Your IdP.
   - Begin by creating groups in your IdP that represent the teams you want to manage in New Relic. For example, you might create groups like team_backend, team_frontend, or team_data.
2. Sync groups via SCIM.
    - Use the SCIM protocol to synchronize your IdP groups with New Relic. This allows New Relic to recognize and manage these groups dynamically.
3. Configure Team Creation in New Relic After your groups are synced.
   
	1.	Navigate to **All Capabilities > Teams** in the New Relic UI.
	2.	Click **Start with New Relic groups**.
	3.	Choose **Automate with a rule** to translate groups into teams.
	4.	Add a rule to match group names. For example, create a rule that applies to any group name starting with ‘team_’.
	5.	Click **Create rule**. You can see your teams in the New Relic UI.

    Note: If your group names don’t follow a clear pattern, you can choose to select the relevant groups manually instead of using a rule.

    After setting this up, New Relic will automatically create and maintain teams that match your rule, keeping them synced with your IdP as changes occur, no manual updates needed.


## Assign Team ownership [#assign-ownership]

There are two ways to assign team ownership to entities:

* Automatically through tags
* Manually through the New Relic UI

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use  our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-teams-tutorial).
</Callout>

### Ownership via tags [#ownership-via-tags]

We recommend this option if you're already leveraging tags to define ownership. New Relic scans all of your entities looking for those tags and assign the entities to the right teams.

For example, if you're defining team ownership through a `team` in your agent's configuration, you can activate this option to have those entities assigned to the corresponding team. If we find a `team:Frontend` tag then any entities with that tag get assigned to your team named `Frontend`.

This functionality works across all of your accounts and data.

As you set up tags, you can also define team aliases so that we match multiple key values to the same team. For example, if the `Frontend` team has `FE` as an alias, then any entities tagged with `team:FE` are assigned to your team named `Frontend`.

Complete these steps:

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Teams > General**.
2. Select the option **Tags for assigning entities to teams**.
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to start using tags for ownership"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to start using tags for ownership"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_use-tags-for-ownership.webp"
    />
3. Select the tags you'd like to use.
4. If you're using more than one team name or some other identifier for the same team, go to the Team hub to set up aliases.
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing where to set up aliases"
        alt="Screenshot showing where to set up aliases"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_set-up-aliases.webp"
    /> */}


In the Teams list, you can see the tags we're using to automatically set ownership for each of the existing Teams: 

{/* <img
    title="Screenshot of overview page after tag setup"
    alt="Screenshot of overview page after tag setup"
    src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_overview-page-with-tags.webp"
/> */}

### Ownership via manual setup [#manual-ownership]

You can assign ownership in the UI on the Team hub page or in the entity headers.

#### In Team hub page [#ownership-via-hub]

Complete the following to assign ownership:

1. Go to the Team's hub page and click **Entity management**:
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing the entity management page"
        alt="Screenshot showing the entity management page"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_entity-management.webp"
    /> */}
2. Select your entities.
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing entity selection"
        alt="Screenshot showing entity selection"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_select-entities.webp"
    /> */}
3. Click **Save**.

#### In entity headers [#entity-headers]

You can also assign an owner to an entity in the entity summary page headers.

{/* <img
    title="Screenshot showing how to assign in header"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to assign in header"
    src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_assign-in-header.webp"
/> */}
#### In Catalogs [#entity-headers]

You can also assign ownership to Catalog entries that are not yet assigned to a Team.
{/* <img
    title="Screenshot showing how to assign in catalogs"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to assign in catalogs"
    src="/images/catalogs_assign_team.webp"
/> */}

## Add contact information and resources to your Team [#add-contacts]

To add contact information, dashboards and other team resources, go to **All Capabilities > Teams > your team > Settings**.

{/* <img
    title="Screenshot showing where to add contact details"
    alt="Screenshot showing where to add contact details"
    src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_add-contact-info.webp"
/> */}

## Save filters for your Team [#save-filters-as-view]

You can filter the **All Entities** view to show only the entities belonging to your Team. 

1. In the entity filter bar, select your Team from the dropdown. Your Teams appear at the top of the **Team** dropdown for easy access.
    {/* <img
        title="Screen shot showing how to find your team in dropdown"
        alt="Screen shot showing how to find your team in dropdown"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_select-team-dropdown.webp"
    /> */}
2. Save the new view by clicking **Save view** next to the capability name at the top left:
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing how to save the view"
        alt="Screenshot showing how to save the view"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_save-view.webp"
    /> */}
3. When the  new menu appears, enter a name for the view, select the permissions, and click **Save** to create the view:
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing where to name the view"
        alt="Screenshot showing where to name the view"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_name-the-view.webp"
    /> */}

    After you complete the process, the view is automatically applied:
    {/* <img
        title="Screenshot showing that the new view is set as default"
        alt="Screenshot showing that the new view is set as default"
        src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_new-default-view.webp"
    /> */}
