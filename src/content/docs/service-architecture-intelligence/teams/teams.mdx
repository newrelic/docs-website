<Callout title="preview">
    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

New Relic Teams lets you connect the entities you're monitoring to the Teams who own them. When you can easily see who owns an entity, you can speed up troubleshooting, enhance team collaboration, and improve your operational efficiency. 

By assigning the different parts of your system to the teams who maintain them, you can find the right team for any service, host, or other entity.

## How can you use Teams across New Relic? [#how-to-use-teams]

You can leverage New Relic Teams in a variety of places across the platform. This means Teams is available when you need it to contact owners of specific entities. Here are some examples of how you can leverage the power of Teams:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="find-during-incident"
        title="During an incident"
    >
      When you're looking at the **Issues** page in **Alerts > Issues and Activity**, you can find the Team information in the **Impacted entities** section.

    <img
    title="How to find team during incident"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to find team during incident"
    src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_find-in-incident.webp"
    />

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="find-while-navigating"
        title="While navigating the platform"
    >
      You can always find the team ownership information in the header of an entity page.

      <img
          title="Screenshot showing how to find during navigation of site"
          alt="Screenshot showing how to find during navigation of site"
          src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_find-navigating.webp"
      />

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="find-in-maps"
        title="In maps"
    >
      When you're looking at maps, you can hover over any entities to show Team details. Also, you can click on an entity to open a right pane that includes team details. 


      <img
          title="Screenshot showing how to find owner in maps"
          alt="Screenshot showing how to find owner in maps"
          src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_find-in-maps.webp"
      />  
    
    </Collapser>
   <Collapser
        id="filter-in-catalogs"
        title="In Catalogs" 
    >
      When you're in **Catalogs**, you can view the Team or Teams assigned to each entity. To navigate to the **Teams** hub page, click the **link**.

      <img
          title="Screenshot showing how to find owner in Catalogs"
          alt="Screenshot showing how to find owner in Catalogs"
          src="/images/catalogs_teams.webp"
      />
        To narrow the Catalog results, you can also filter by Team.
        <img
            title="Screenshot showing how to filter by team in Catalogs"
            alt="Screenshot showing how to filter by team in Catalogs"
            src="/images/catalogs_filter_team.webp"
        />
        You can save UI changes by creating a Saved View, as explained in the [Customize the UI for your team](#customize-ui) section.

    </Collapser>
   <Collapser
        id="filter-in-all-entities"
        title="In All Entities" 
    >
      When you're in **All Entities**, you can filter by Team to narrow the results. 

      <img
          title="Screenshot showing how to find owner in all entities"
          alt="Screenshot showing how to find owner in all entities"
          src="/images/teams_screenshot-crop_find-in-all-entities.webp"
      />

    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
