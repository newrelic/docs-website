The New Relic GitHub integration imports users and teams from your GitHub account to enhance the visibility of your [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started) in the New Relic platform. 

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams, simplifies role management, and clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing the setup configuration, time, and effort. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer to the [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started).

* **Supported platform:** GitHub Cloud, GitHub Enterprise (GHE) Cloud (without data residency).

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
* GHE on-premise, and GHE Cloud with data residency aren't supported.
* Installing the integration in GitHub user accounts is not supported. Although GitHub allows installing the app in a user account, the sync mechanism will not work, and no data will be imported into New Relic.
* Note that the Github integration is NOT Fedramp compliant.
</Callout>


**Prerequisites:**

* Login to your GitHub account you plan to integrate with New Relic.
* You must be the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager.

* Required entitlements:
    * `teams_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_ccu`





## Set up the GitHub integration

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. On the **Select an account** screen, keep the default account selection and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Integration setup** screen:

    1. To connect with your GitHub account, click **Install**. The New Relic Observability opens in the GitHub Marketplace. 
    2. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization to retrieve data related to users, teams, and repositories.
        After the installation is complete, you will be redirected to the New Relic platform.
    3. Click **First time sync**.
    4. *(Optional)* Click **On-demand sync** to manually sync the data.

        <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">

            You can manually synchronize the data once every 4 hours. The **On-demand sync** button remains disabled if sync has occurred within the previous 4 hours.

        </Callout>

        <Callout variant="warning" title="warning">

            If the organization contains hundreds or thousands of teams and repos (Team count > 200
or repo count>500), the complete sync might take a few hours due to the rate limits on GitHub APIs.

        </Callout>

    5. After you view the Sync started message, click **Continue**. The **GitHub Integration** screen will then display the count of teams and repositories, refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

            alt="GitHub integration"
            src="/images/github-integration-progress.webp"
        /> 

4. On the **GitHub integration** screen:

    - Click **Go to Teams** to view the imported teams information on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams).

    <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">

        To auto-assign the GitHub repositories to their teams, create a `teamOwningRepo` custom property in GitHub with the team name as its string value. The integration will automatically assign the repositories to the respective teams based on the custom property.
    
    </Callout>

### Rate limit handling
If the teams count is more than 200 or the repo count is more than 500, the integration handles rate limits by ingesting data in cycles:

* Teams skeleton are ingested first, followed by teams data.
* Repo skeleton are ingested next, followed by repo data.
* If a rate limit occurs in between, the next cycle starts from the last sync value of team or repo.

## Uninstall the GitHub integration
Uninstalling the Github integration will stop sending data to New Relic from the uninstalled organisation. However, the data already ingested will remain in New Relic. The integration will not delete any data from New Relic.
To uninstall the GitHub integration, follow these steps:
1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. Click **Uninstall**.
3. Select the Github organisation that you want to uninstall and click **Uninstall organisation**.
