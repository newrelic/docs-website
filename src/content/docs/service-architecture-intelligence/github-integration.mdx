Are you looking to gain deeper insights into your service architecture by leveraging data from your GitHub account? The New Relic GitHub integration offers a powerful solution by importing repositories, teams, and user data directly into the New Relic platform. This integration is designed to enrich your [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started) capability, providing you with a comprehensive view that enhances operational intelligence.

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams while simplifying role management. It also clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing setup time and effort.. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer to the [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started).

Discover how the New Relic GitHub integration can transform your visibility and control over your service architecture, enabling you to unlock new levels of insight and efficiency.

* **Supported platform:** GitHub Cloud, GitHub Enterprise (GHE) Cloud (without data residency).

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
* GHE on-premise, and GHE Cloud with data residency aren't supported.
* Installing the integration in GitHub user accounts is not supported. Although GitHub allows installing the app in a user account, the sync mechanism will not work, and no data will be imported into New Relic.
* Note that the GitHub integration isn't FedRAMP compliant.
</Callout>


**Prerequisites:**

* Log in to your GitHub account you plan to integrate with New Relic.
* You must be the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager.

* Required entitlements:
    * `teams_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_ccu`





## Set up the GitHub integration

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. On the **Select an action** step, select** Install the integration**, and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Integration setup** screen:

    a. To connect with your GitHub account, click **Continue the installation**. The New Relic Observability opens in the GitHub Marketplace. 

    b. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization to retrieve data related to users, teams, and repositories.
    After the installation is complete, you will be redirected to the **Select an action** step one more time.
         
    c. select **Install the integration**, and click **Continue**.

    d. Click **Start first sync**.

    e. *(Optional)* Click **Sync on demand** to manually sync the data.

        <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">

            You can manually synchronize the data once every 4 hours. The **Sync on demand** button remains disabled if sync has occurred within the previous 4 hours.

        </Callout>

        <Callout variant="warning" title="warning">

            If the organization contains hundreds or thousands of teams and repos (Team count > 200
or repo count>500), the complete sync might take a few hours due to the rate limits on GitHub APIs.

        </Callout>

    f. After you view the **Sync started** message, click **Continue**. The **Integration status**  screen will then display the count of teams and repositories, refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

            src="/images/github-integration-progress.webp"
        /> 

4. On the **GitHub integration** screen:

    - Click **Integration status** to view the imported teams information on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams).

    <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">

        
        You can auto-assign GitHub repositories to their teams by creating a `teamOwningRepo` custom property in GitHub. Set the custom property at the organization level and assign a value for the custom property at the repository level. Additionally, you can set up a custom property for multiple repositories at the organization level simultaneously. The integration will automatically assign the repositories to the respective teams based on the custom property. For more information on creating custom properties, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
