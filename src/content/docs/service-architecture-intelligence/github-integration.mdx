<Callout title="PREVIEW">
We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Are you looking to gain deeper insights into your service architecture by leveraging data from your GitHub account? The New Relic GitHub integration imports repositories and teams directly into the New Relic platform with selective data fetching capabilities.

With the new selective data fetching feature, you can choose exactly which data types to import—whether it's teams, repositories and pull requests, or both. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of Teams, [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer to the [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started).

## Before you begin

**Prerequisites:**

* You must be the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager.

**Supported platforms:**
* GitHub Cloud
* GitHub Enterprise (GHE) Cloud (without data residency)

**Supported regions:** US and EU regions

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
* GHE on-premise, and GHE Cloud with data residency aren't supported.
* Installing the integration in GitHub user accounts is not supported. Although GitHub allows installing the app in a user account, the sync mechanism will not work, and no data will be imported into New Relic.
* Note that the GitHub integration isn't FedRAMP compliant.
</Callout>


## What data can be synced

The GitHub integration allows you to selectively choose which data types to import into New Relic, giving you control over what information is synchronized:

### Available data types

* **Teams**: Import GitHub teams and their membership to enhance team management and ownership mapping

  <Callout variant="important">
  **User email visibility requirement**: To ensure that team membership is aligned with your GitHub teams, GitHub users will need to have configured their email addresses as public in their GitHub profile settings. Team members with private email configurations will be excluded from the user data synchronization process.
  </Callout>

* **Repositories and Pull Requests**: Import repository data and pull request information for better code visibility and deployment tracking

### Data selection considerations

<Callout variant="important">
**Team integration conflicts**: If teams have already been integrated into New Relic from another source (such as Okta or other Identity Provider), GitHub teams will not be allowed to be fetched and stored to prevent data conflicts. In this case, you can only select repositories and pull request data.
</Callout>

You'll be able to configure your data selection preferences during the initial setup process.


## Set up the GitHub integration

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. Select the account where you'd like to have the integration setup.
3. Select your instrumentation method.
4. Select **Set up a new integration**, and click **Continue**.
5. On the **Begin integration** screen:

    a. To connect with your GitHub account, click **Get started in GitHub**. The New Relic Observability opens in the GitHub Marketplace.
    b. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization to retrieve data related to your selected data types.
    After the installation is complete, you will be redirected to the **Select an action** step one more time.
    c. Select **Begin integration**, and click **Continue**.
         
    d. **Select your data preferences**: Choose which data types you want to sync:
       * **Teams + Users**: Import GitHub team structures and user information
       * **Repositories + Pull Requests**: Import repository and pull request data
       * **Both**: Import all available data types
       
       <Callout variant="tip">
       If teams are already integrated from another source (such as Okta or another Identity Provider), the **Teams + Users** option will be disabled to prevent conflicts.
       </Callout>

    e. Click **Start first sync** to begin importing your selected data types.

    f. After you view the **Sync started** message, click **Continue**. The **Integration status** screen will display the count of your selected data types (teams, repositories, etc.), refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

        <img

            alt="GitHub integration"
            src="/images/github-integration-progress.webp"
        /> 

6. *(Optional)* On the **GitHub integration** screen, access your imported data:

    * Click **Go to Teams** to view the imported teams information on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams) (if teams were selected during setup)
    * Click **Go to Repositories** to view the imported repositories information on [Repositories](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/repositories/repositories) (if repositories were selected during setup)

## Manage your GitHub integration

After setting up your GitHub integration, you can manage it through the New Relic interface. This includes refreshing data, editing configuration, and uninstalling when needed.

### Access integration management

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.

2. On the **Select an action** step, select **Manage your organization**, and click **Continue**.

    <img
        title="GitHub integration manage organization option"
        alt="Screenshot showing the manage organization option in GitHub integration"
        src="/images/github-integration-manage-org-option.webp"
    />

The **Manage GitHub integration** screen displays your connected organizations with their current sync status and data types.


### Refresh data

When you click the **Refresh data** option, it provides a streamlined way to update your GitHub data in New Relic.

**To refresh data:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate your organization.

2. Click **Refresh data** next to the organization that you want to update and then click **Continue**.

3. On the **Refresh Data** step, click **Sync on demand**.

The system will then validate your GitHub permissions and organization access, fetch only new or changed data since the last sync, process and map the updated data according to your selected data types, and update the integration status to reflect the latest sync timestamp and data counts.

**What gets refreshed:**
* Teams and their membership
* Repository changes (new repos, archived repos, permission changes)
* Updated team ownership through custom properties

<Callout variant="tip">
**Refresh frequency**: You can refresh data as often as needed. The process typically takes a few minutes depending on the size of your organization and selected data types.
</Callout>

### Edit integration settings

Use the **Edit** option to modify your integration configuration after initial setup. You can adjust which data types are synchronized between GitHub and New Relic, choosing from Teams + Users, Repositories + Pull Requests, or Both data types based on your current needs.

**To edit the GitHub integration:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate your organization.

2. Click **Edit** next to the organization that you want to update and then click **Continue**.

3. On the **Edit Integration Settings** step, adjust your data type selections as needed.

4. Click **Save changes** to apply your updates.

**What happens during edit:**
* Current data remains intact during configuration changes
* New settings apply to subsequent syncs
* You can preview changes before applying them
* The integration continues running with previous settings until you save changes


### Set up automatic team ownership

You can auto-assign GitHub repositories to their teams by adding `teamOwningRepo` as a custom property in GitHub.

Create the custom property at the organization level and assign a value for the custom property at the repository level. Additionally, you can set up a custom property for multiple repositories at the organization level simultaneously.

Then, in New Relic Teams, enable the Automated Ownership feature, making sure to use `team` as the tag key.

Once this is set up, we'll automatically match each repo with its correct team.

For more information on creating custom properties, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

### Uninstall the GitHub integration

Uninstalling the GitHub integration stops data synchronization from the selected organization but preserves all previously imported data in New Relic.

**To uninstall:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate the organization you want to uninstall and click **Uninstall**.

2. In the confirmation dialog, review the organization details and click **Uninstall organization** to confirm.

3. You'll see a success message confirming the uninstallation.


<Callout variant="important">
**Data retention after uninstall**: All previously synced data (teams, users, repositories, pull requests) will remain in New Relic after uninstalling the integration. If you need to remove this data, contact New Relic support.
