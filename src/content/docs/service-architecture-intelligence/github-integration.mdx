Are you looking to gain deeper insights into your service architecture by leveraging data from your GitHub account? The New Relic GitHub integration imports repositories, teams, and user data directly into the New Relic platform with selective data fetching capabilities.

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams while simplifying role management. It also clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing setup time and effort. With the new selective data fetching feature, you can choose exactly which data types to importâ€”whether it's teams and users, repositories and pull requests, or both. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer to the [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started).


* **Supported platforms:** 
  - GitHub Cloud
  - GitHub Enterprise (GHE) Cloud (without data residency)
* **Supported regions:** US and EU regions

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
* GHE on-premise, and GHE Cloud with data residency aren't supported.
* Installing the integration in GitHub user accounts is not supported. Although GitHub allows installing the app in a user account, the sync mechanism will not work, and no data will be imported into New Relic.
* Note that the GitHub integration isn't FedRAMP compliant.
</Callout>


**Prerequisites:**

* Log in to your GitHub account you plan to integrate with New Relic.
* You must be the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager.

* Required entitlements:
    * `teams_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_discount_usage`
    * `integration_github_ccu`





## What data can be synced

The GitHub integration allows you to selectively choose which data types to import into New Relic, giving you control over what information is synchronized:

### Available data types

* **Teams and Users**: Import GitHub team structures and user information to enhance team management and ownership mapping
  
  <Callout variant="important">
  **User email visibility requirement**: The integration only imports GitHub users who have configured their email addresses as public in their GitHub profile settings. Team members with private email configurations will be excluded from the user data synchronization process.
  </Callout>

* **Repositories and Pull Requests**: Import repository data and pull request information for better code visibility and deployment tracking
* **Both**: Import all available data types for comprehensive GitHub integration

### Data selection considerations

<Callout variant="important">
**Team integration conflicts**: If teams have already been integrated into New Relic from another source (such as Service teams), GitHub teams will not be allowed to be fetched and stored to prevent data conflicts. In this case, you can only select repositories and pull request data.
</Callout>

You'll be able to configure your data selection preferences during the initial setup process.


## Set up the GitHub integration

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. On the **Select an action** step, select **Install the integration**, and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Integration setup** screen:

    a. **Select your data preferences**: Choose which data types you want to sync:
       - **Teams + Users**: Import GitHub team structures and user information
       - **Repositories + Pull Requests**: Import repository and pull request data
       - **Both**: Import all available data types
       
       <Callout variant="tip">
       If teams are already integrated from another source (like Service teams), the Teams + Users option will be disabled to prevent conflicts.
       </Callout>

    b. To connect with your GitHub account, click **Continue the installation**. The New Relic Observability opens in the GitHub Marketplace. 

    c. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization to retrieve data related to your selected data types.
    After the installation is complete, you will be redirected to the **Select an action** step one more time.
         
    d. Select **Install the integration**, and click **Continue**.

    e. Click **Start first sync** to begin importing your selected data types.

    f. *(Optional)* Click **Sync on demand** to manually sync the data.

        <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">
            You can manually synchronize the data once every 4 hours. The **Sync on demand** button remains disabled if sync has occurred within the previous 4 hours.
        </Callout>

        <Callout variant="warning" title="warning">
            If the organization contains hundreds or thousands of teams and repos (Team count > 200 or repo count > 500), the complete sync might take a few hours due to the rate limits on GitHub APIs. Sync time will vary based on your selected data types.
        </Callout>

    g. After you view the **Sync started** message, click **Continue**. The **Integration status** screen will display the count of your selected data types (teams, repositories, etc.), refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

            src="/images/github-integration-progress.webp"
        /> 

4. *(Optional)* On the **GitHub integration** screen, access your imported data:

    - Click **Go to Teams** to view the imported teams information on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams) (if teams were selected during setup)
    - Click **Go to Repositories** to view the imported repositories information on [Repositories](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/repositories/repositories) (if repositories were selected during setup)

    <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">
        **Auto-assign repositories to teams**: You can automatically assign GitHub repositories to their teams by creating a `teamOwningRepo` custom property in GitHub. Create the custom property at the organization level and assign a value for the custom property at the repository level. Additionally, you can set up a custom property for multiple repositories at the organization level simultaneously. The integration will automatically assign the repositories to the respective teams based on the custom property. For more information on creating custom properties, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
    </Callout>

    


## Enable team ownership discovery

The GitHub integration includes a discovery service that can automatically establish team ownership of repositories based on GitHub's organizational structure and custom properties.

### How team ownership works

The discovery service uses multiple methods to establish repository ownership:

1. **GitHub custom properties**: Uses the `teamOwningRepo` custom property to directly assign repositories to teams
2. **Team membership analysis**: Analyzes commit patterns and team member contributions to infer ownership
3. **Repository organization**: Uses GitHub's organizational structure and team permissions to determine ownership

### Setting up automatic team ownership

To enable automatic team ownership discovery:

1. **Create custom properties in GitHub** (recommended):
   - Navigate to your GitHub organization settings
   - Create a `teamOwningRepo` custom property at the organization level
   - Assign team values to repositories at the repository level
   - The integration will automatically map these relationships during sync

2. **Configure team permissions**:
   - Ensure teams have appropriate repository access in GitHub
   - The discovery service will use these permissions to infer ownership relationships

3. **Enable automatic team ownership discovery**:
   - After sync completion, enable automatic team ownership discovery in New Relic. For more information, refer to the [Automating Teams ownership documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/manage-teams/#assign-ownership).
   - Verify that ownership relationships are correctly established

<Callout variant="tip">
**Best practices for team ownership**:
- Use consistent naming conventions for teams across GitHub and New Relic
- Regularly update custom properties when repository ownership changes
- Review and validate ownership mappings after each sync to ensure accuracy
</Callout>


## Uninstall the GitHub integration

Uninstalling the GitHub integration will stop sending data to New Relic from the uninstalled organization. However, the data already ingested will remain in New Relic. The integration will not delete any existing data from New Relic.

To uninstall the GitHub integration:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. On the **Select an action** step, select **Uninstall the integration**, and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Uninstall the GitHub integration** step, select the GitHub organization that you want to uninstall and click **Uninstall organization**.

<Callout variant="important">
**Data retention after uninstall**: All previously synced data (teams, users, repositories, pull requests) will remain in New Relic after uninstalling the integration. If you need to remove this data, contact New Relic support.
