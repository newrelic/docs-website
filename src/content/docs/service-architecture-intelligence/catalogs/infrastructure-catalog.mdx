<Callout variant="caution" title="Preview">
We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

This feature is currently provided as part of a preview pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/).
</Callout>

The Infrastructure Catalog provides a complete inventory of all your infrastructure entities. Use it to manage resources, accelerate root cause analysis, and identify observability gaps. The catalog displays key information for each resource, including high-level details, ownership, configuration data, and its relationships with other resources, applications, and services.

Data is populated automatically from New Relic infrastructure agents and cloud integrations.

## Key features [#key-features]

* **Centralized resource view:** Gain a high-level, cross-account view of your infrastructure resources. Filter and group by attributes like resource category, entity type, region, environment, or team to improve organization and visibility.

* **Application and service mapping:** See which applications and services are running on each compute resource to quickly assess impact and triage issues.

* **Clear ownership and accountability:** Easily identify owners for both infrastructure components and their dependent applications or services. This clarifies accountability when infrastructure issues arise.

* **Actionable resource insights:** Access insights into infrastructure activity—including health status, related incidents, scorecards, and more—to inform your resource optimization efforts.

* **Detailed resource configuration:** Quickly access current configuration data for each resource, enabling faster debugging and reducing context switching.

## Access the Infrastructure catalog [#access-infra-catalog]

The Infrastructure catalog is available in the New Relic platform, providing a comprehensive view of your infrastructure resources. You can use it to manage your resources, accelerate root cause analysis, and identify observability gaps.

**Prerequisites:**

* Enable the Catalogs in your New Relic account. For more information, refer [Enable the Catalogs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs/#enable-catalogs).
* (Recommended) Turn on [Autodiscovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities/) to see how your applications connect to their underlying infrastructure resources. This helps you get more value from the Infrastructure catalog.

**To access the Infrastructure catalog inventory:**

1. Log in to your New Relic platform.
2. Go to the left navigation pane > Catalogs > Infrastructure catalog.

    The Infrastructure Catalog page displays multiple columns to present various information for an infra resource:
