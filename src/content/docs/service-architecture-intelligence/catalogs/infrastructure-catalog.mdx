The Infrastructure Catalog provides a complete inventory of all your infrastructure entities. Use it to manage resources, accelerate root cause analysis, and identify observability gaps. The catalog displays key information for each resource, including high-level details, ownership, configuration data, and its relationships with other resources, applications, and services.

Data is populated automatically from New Relic infrastructure agents and cloud integrations.

## Key features [#key-features]

* Centralized resource view: Gain a high-level, cross-account view of your infrastructure resources. Filter and group by attributes like resource category, entity type, region, environment, or team to improve organization and visibility.

* Application and service mapping: See which applications and services are running on each compute resource to quickly assess impact and triage issues.

* Clear ownership and accountability: Easily identify owners for both infrastructure components and their dependent applications or services. This clarifies accountability when infrastructure issues arise.

* Actionable resource insights: Access insights into infrastructure activity—including health status, related alert events, scorecards, and more—to inform your resource optimization efforts.

* Detailed resource configuration: Quickly access current configuration data for each resource, enabling faster debugging and reducing context switching.

## Access the Infrastructure catalog [#access-infra-catalog]

The Infrastructure catalog is available in the New Relic platform, providing a comprehensive view of your infrastructure resources. You can use it to manage your resources, accelerate root cause analysis, and identify observability gaps.

**Prerequisites:**

* Enable Catalogs in your New Relic account. For more information, see [Enable the Catalogs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs/#enable-catalogs).
* (Recommended) Turn on [Autodiscovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities/) to see how your applications connect to their underlying infrastructure resources. This helps you get more value from the Infrastructure catalog.

**To access the Infrastructure catalog inventory:**

1. Log in to your New Relic platform.
2. Go to the left navigation pane > Catalogs > Infrastructure catalog.

### View resource configuration with Autodiscovery [#autodiscovery-config]

For resources augmented by [Autodiscovery](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities/), you can view detailed configuration information in the side panel. Click any row in the table to open the side panel, which displays the current configuration of the resource. This helps you quickly access configuration details for faster debugging and troubleshooting without switching contexts.

### Add new data [#add-new-data]
