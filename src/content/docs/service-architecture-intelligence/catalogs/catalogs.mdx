New Relic Catalogs provides a single-pane view that enhances the observability and management of systems across your organization. By offering a unified perspective on entities, it empowers teams to make well-informed decisions, streamline operations, and collaborate more effectively.

With Catalogs, you can quickly identify and focus on the most relevant information, ensuring easy access to what matters most. It serves as the single source of truth, enabling users to discover, manage, and optimize their systems with confidence.

By consolidating data from multiple sourcesâ€”including <DNT>[Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams)</DNT>, <DNT>[Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started)</DNT>, <DNT>[Maps](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps/)</DNT>, and <DNT>[repository](/docs/codestream/observability/repo-association/)</DNT> into a single interface. Catalogs replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> view, offering a more structured and insightful experience. It provides a comprehensive overview of high-value entities, enriched with detailed metadata and actionable insights, helping teams stay aligned and efficient.

### Personalize the view [#personalized-view]

You can customize the <DNT>Catalogs</DNT> view to add or remove filters and columns based on your preferences. This allows you to focus on the most relevant content and streamline your workflows.

    {/* <img
            title="Filters in Catalog"
            alt="Filters in Catalog"
            src={CatalogFilters}
    /> */}

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>To add filters</td>
            <td>Click the plus icon <DNT>(+)</DNT> in the top pane and select the required filter from the list. You can add multiple filters to refine your search.</td>

<Callout variant="tip" title="Tip">
