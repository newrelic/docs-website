New Relic Catalogs provides a single-pane view that enhances the observability and management of systems across your organization. By offering a unified perspective on entities, it empowers teams to make well-informed decisions, streamline operations, and collaborate more effectively.

With Catalogs, you can quickly identify and focus on the most relevant information, ensuring easy access to what matters most. It serves as the single source of truth, enabling users to discover, manage, and optimize their systems with confidence.

By consolidating data from multiple sources—including <DNT>[Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams)</DNT>, <DNT>[Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started)</DNT>, <DNT>[Maps](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps/)</DNT>, and repository into a single interface, Catalogs replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> view, offering a more structured and insightful experience. It provides a comprehensive overview of high-value entities, enriched with detailed metadata and actionable insights, helping teams stay aligned and efficient.



## Key features [#features]

-  Unified view: Catalogs is integrated with various sources such as <DNT>[Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams)</DNT>, <DNT>[Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started)</DNT>, <DNT>[Maps](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/maps/advanced-maps/)</DNT>, and repository into a single cohesive interface. This displays high-value entity types with detailed metadata including golden metrics and insights to provide a deeper understanding of system status.

-  Personalized experience: Allows users to customize their view to focus on the most relevant content. This helps users to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

-  Seamless integration: Connects users with other New Relic capabilities to allow them to explore data in depth and gain a thorough understanding of entities.

-  Score: Integrates with Scorecards to show how your entities are performing against company-defined best practices. For more information, see <DNT>[Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started)</DNT>.

    {/* <img
            title="Catalog"
            alt="Catalog"
            src={CatalogHome}
    /> */}

    <Callout variant="tip">
    To go back to the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> page, see [Back to All Entities](#back-entities).
    </Callout>

### Personalize the view [#personalized-view]

You can customize the <DNT>Catalogs</DNT> view to add or remove filters and columns based on your preferences. This allows you to focus on the most relevant content and streamline your workflows.

    {/* <img
            title="Filters in Catalog"
            alt="Filters in Catalog"
            src={CatalogFilters}
    /> */}

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>To add filters</td>
            <td>Click the plus icon <DNT>(+)</DNT> in the top pane and select the required filter from the list. You can add multiple filters to refine your search.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Group by</td>
            <td>Select one of the options from the dropdown menu to group content and obtain a high-level view of your entities.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>To show or hide columns</td>
            <td>Click the columns icon on the right pane and select or deselect the required columns to show or hide.</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

#### View entity details with the side panel [#side-panel]

Click any entity row in the table to open a side panel displaying detailed entity information and metadata. This allows you to customize the main table view to show only the most relevant columns for your day-to-day use while still being able to access all contextual information and metadata when needed.
This approach streamlines your workflow by keeping the main view uncluttered while ensuring all detailed information remains readily accessible.

### Back to All Entities [#back-entities]

The new Catalogs view replaces the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> capability from the navigation. If you need to find operational entities such as Synthetics, Workloads, Service Levels, and more, use the <DNT>Quick Find (cmd + K or ctrl+K)</DNT> global search, or find them in their corresponding capabilities.

<Callout variant="tip">

Any link, permalink, or saved view referring to <DNT>All Entities</DNT> will continue to work as expected, regardless of whether you're in the new <DNT>Catalogs</DNT> experience or you've switched back to <DNT>All Entities</DNT>.

</Callout>

**To switch back to the <DNT>All Entities</DNT> page:**

1. Log in to your New Relic platform.
2. Go to the **left navigation pane > Catalogs**.
2. Click the <DNT>**Switch back to all entities**</DNT> button. This enables the New Relic <DNT>All Entities</DNT> experience.
