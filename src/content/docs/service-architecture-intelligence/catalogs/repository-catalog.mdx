The <DNT>Repository catalog</DNT> is a tool designed to centralize and streamline the management of repositories within an organization. By providing a unified view of all repositories, it breaks down silos between teams and enhances cross-team collaboration. It enables developers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and other stakeholders to efficiently identify existing repositories, understand their purpose, and determine ownership or status. This centralized approach simplifies the discovery, access, and management of code repositories, leading to improved collaboration, accountability, and productivity across the organization.


## Key features [#features]

-  Centralized Repository Discovery: Quickly identify repositories relevant to services, projects, or <DNT>[Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams)</DNT>, minimizing the time spent searching or consulting with colleagues.

-  Service and Repository Navigation: Seamlessly navigate from applications or services to their defining repositories and vice versa, aiding in understanding code dependencies and infrastructure.

-  Ownership and Accountability: Easily identify repository owners, supporting direct queries and enhancing accountability within teams.

- Repository Insights: Access detailed metrics on repository activity, such as open pull requests and deployment history, to identify neglected projects and optimize resource allocation.

- Management and Operations: Perform bulk operations, such as assigning tags or teams, to efficiently manage repositories and maintain organizational standards.
