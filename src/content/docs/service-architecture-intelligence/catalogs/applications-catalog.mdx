Applications catalog offers a single-pane view to enhance the observability and management of entities in your organization. The unified view of Services - APM, Services - OpenTelemetry, Browser, and Mobile entities facilitates well-informed decision-making, streamlined operations, and improved collaboration across teams.


### Supported entities [#supported-entities]

The current New Relic Applications catalog experience supports the following entities:

* `Services - APM`
* `Services - OpenTelemetry`
* `Browser`
* `Mobile`

## Manage and organize your catalog [#manage-organize]

The catalog provides flexible tools to sort, group, and filter your data.

### Group data [#group-data]

To organize your list into logical sections, use the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> dropdown at the top right of the table. You can group entities by:

* <DNT>**Entity type**</DNT>: Separate APM services from Browser or Mobile entities.
* <DNT>**Environment**</DNT>: Distinguish between environments. For example, production versus staging.
* <DNT>**Team**</DNT>: View services by the responsible ownership group.
* <DNT>**Language**</DNT>: Organize by the programming language used.
* <DNT>**AI asset**</DNT>: Group by detected AI libraries like OpenAI or Bedrock.

### Customize visible columns [#customize-columns]

You can control which data points display in the table to reduce noise and focus on specific metrics. Use the <DNT>**Column Selection**</DNT> icon to the right of the <DNT>**Group by**</DNT> menu to show or hide attributes like <DNT>**Account**</DNT>, <DNT>**Last deployment**</DNT>, <DNT>**AI assets**</DNT>, or golden metrics such as response time and throughput.

### Filter data [#filter-data]

Use the filter bar at the top to narrow down your entities:

* <DNT>**Quick filters**</DNT>: Use the pre-defined buttons to filter by entity type, AI asset, or team.
* <DNT>**Custom filter rules**</DNT>: Click the <DNT>**+**</DNT> icon to add specific attributes. You can define rules using operators like `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE` to filter for a specific attribute value. For example, filter entities where <DNT>Language</DNT> `=` `go` to get all Go services.
* <DNT>**Global search**</DNT>: Use the <DNT>**Search by entity name**</DNT> bar to find specific services instantly.

### Add new data [#add-new-data]

To add additional data to your Applications catalog, click the <DNT>**+ Add data**</DNT> button at the top right. Follow the on-screen instructions to add data to your Applications catalog.
