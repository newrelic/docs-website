The GitHub integration enhances Service Architecture Intelligence by enriching your New Relic data with context from your GitHub organization. By connecting your GitHub account, you can import your repositories, teams, and pull request data into New Relic. This additional information strengthens the value of [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams), [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started), giving you a more complete and connected view of your engineering work.

## Before you begin

**Prerequisites:**

* You must have either the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager role.

**Supported platforms:**
* GitHub Cloud
* GitHub Enterprise Cloud (without data residency)

**Supported regions:** US and EU regions

<Callout variant="important" title="important">
* GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency are not supported.
* Installing the integration in GitHub user accounts is not supported. While GitHub allows installing the app at the user level, the sync process will not function, and no data will be imported into New Relic.
* The GitHub integration is not FedRAMP compliant.
</Callout>


## What data can be synced

The GitHub integration allows you to selectively choose which data types to import into New Relic, giving you control over what information is synchronized:

### Available data types

* **Repositories and Pull Requests**: Import repository and pull request data for better code visibility and deployment tracking
* **Teams**: Import GitHub teams and their membership to enhance team management and ownership mapping

  <Callout variant="important">
  **Team integration conflicts**: If teams have already been integrated into New Relic from another source (such as Okta or other Identity Provider), GitHub teams will not be allowed to be fetched and stored to prevent data conflicts. In this case, you can only select repositories and pull request data.  
  **User email visibility requirement**: To ensure that team membership is aligned with your GitHub teams, GitHub users will need to have configured their email addresses as public in their GitHub profile settings. Team members with private email configurations will be excluded from the user data synchronization process.
  </Callout>


## Set up the GitHub integration

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. Select the account where you'd like to have the integration setup.
3. Select **Set up a new integration**, and click **Continue**.
4. On the **Begin integration** screen:
  
    a. Click **Get started in GitHub** to connect your account. The New Relic Observability app opens in the GitHub Marketplace.
  
    b. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization. After installation, you will be redirected back to the New Relic interface.
    
    c. Select **Begin integration** again, and click **Continue**.

    d. **Select your data preferences**: Choose which data types you want to sync:

    * **Teams + Users**: Import GitHub team structures and user information.
    * **Repositories + Pull Requests**: Import repository and pull request data.
    * **Both**: Import all available data types.

    e. If you selected **Teams + Users**, a list of all GitHub teams will be displayed. Select all or a selection of teams to import.

    f. Click **Start first sync** to begin importing your selected data.

    g. After you view the **Sync started** message, click **Continue**. The **Integration status** screen will display the count of your selected data types (teams, repositories, etc.), refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

        /> 

5. *(Optional)* On the **GitHub integration** screen, you can access your imported data:

    * Click **Go to Teams** to view the imported teams on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams) page (if teams were selected during setup).
    * Click **Go to Repositories** to view the imported repositories information on [Repositories](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/repositories/repositories) catalog (if repositories were selected during setup).

## Manage your GitHub integration

After setting up your GitHub integration, you can manage it through the New Relic interface. This includes refreshing data, editing configuration, and uninstalling when needed.

### Access integration management

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.

2. On the **Select an action** step, select **Manage your organization**, and click **Continue**.

    <img
        title="GitHub integration manage organization option"
        alt="Screenshot showing the manage organization option in GitHub integration"
        src="/images/github-integration-manage-org-option.webp"
    />

The **Manage GitHub integration** screen displays your connected organizations with their current sync status and data types.


### Refresh data

The Refresh data option provides a streamlined way to update your GitHub data in New Relic.

**To refresh data:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate your organization.

2. Click **Refresh data** next to the organization that you want to update, and then click **Continue**.

3. On the **Refresh Data** step, click **Sync on demand**.

The system will then validate your GitHub permissions and organization access, fetch only new or changed data since the last sync, process and map the updated data according to your selected data types, and update the integration status to reflect the latest sync timestamp and data counts.

**What gets refreshed:**
* Teams and their membership
* Repository changes (new repos, archived repos, permission changes)
* Updated team ownership through custom properties

<Callout variant="tip">
**Refresh frequency**: You can refresh data as often as needed. The process typically takes a few minutes depending on the size of your organization and selected data types.
</Callout>

### Edit integration settings

Use the **Edit** option to modify your integration configuration after initial setup. You can adjust which data types are synchronized between GitHub and New Relic, as well as the selection of which teams are in sync.

**To edit the GitHub integration:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate your organization.

2. Click **Edit** next to the organization that you want to update and then click **Continue**.

3. On the **Edit Integration Settings** step, adjust your selections as needed.

4. Click **Save changes** to apply your updates.

**What happens during edit:**
* Current data remains intact during configuration changes. If your selection of teams to sync is now different, the previous selection will not be deleted from New Relic, but it will be without synchronization with GitHub. You can delete these teams in the Teams capability.
* New settings apply to subsequent syncs
* You can preview changes before applying them
* The integration continues running with previous settings until you save changes


### Set up automatic team ownership

You can auto-assign GitHub repositories to their teams by adding `teamOwningRepo` as a custom property in GitHub.

Create the custom property at the organization level and assign a value for the custom property at the repository level. Additionally, you can set up a custom property for multiple repositories at the organization level simultaneously.

Then, in New Relic Teams, enable the Automated Ownership feature, making sure to use `team` as the tag key.

Once this is set up, we'll automatically match each repo with its correct team.

For more information on creating custom properties, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

### Uninstall the GitHub integration

Uninstalling the GitHub integration stops data synchronization from the selected organization. You will be given the option to either preserve or delete the previously imported data within New Relic.

**To uninstall:**

1. From the **Manage GitHub integration** screen, locate the organization you want to uninstall and click **Uninstall**.

2. In the confirmation dialog, select whether you want to Keep the data or Delete the data.

3. Review the details and click Uninstall organization to confirm.

4. You'll see a success message confirming the uninstallation.


<Callout variant="important">
**Data retention after uninstall**: Data that is kept will no longer be synchronized with GitHub and can be manually deleted later within the New Relic platform (e.g., via the Teams capability).
