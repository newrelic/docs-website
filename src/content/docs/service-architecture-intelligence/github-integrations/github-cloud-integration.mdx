<Callout title="PREVIEW">

    We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>


The New Relic GitHub integration imports users and teams from your GitHub account to enhance the visibility of your [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started) in the New Relic platform. 

This integration streamlines the onboarding process for users and teams, simplifies role management, and clarifies entity ownership mapping, reducing the setup configuration, time, and effort. This integration aims to enhance the management and visibility of [Catalogs](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/catalogs/catalogs) and [Scorecards](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/scorecards/getting-started) within New Relic. For more information, refer [Service Architecture Intelligence capability](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/getting-started). 


**Prerequisites**

* Login to your GitHub account you plan to integrate with New Relic.
* You must be the Organization Manager or Authentication Domain Manager.


**To set up the GitHub integration:**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > + Integration & Agents > GitHub integration](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9306060d-b674-b245-083e-ff8d42765e0d)**.
2. Select **Github enterprise Cloud** as the instrumentation method and select **Continue**.
2. On the **Select an account** screen, keep the default account selection and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Integration setup** screen:

    1. To connect with your GitHub account, click **Install**. The New Relic Observability opens in the GitHub Marketplace. 
    2. Complete the app installation within your GitHub organization to retrieve data related to users, teams, and repositories.
        After the installation is complete, you will be redirected to the New Relic platform.
    3. Click **First time sync**.
    4. *(Optional)* Click **On-demand sync** to manually sync the data.

        <Callout variant="tip" title="tip">

            You can manually synchronize the data once every 4 hours. The **On-demand sync** button remains disabled if sync has occurred within the previous 4 hours.

        </Callout>

    5. After you view the Sync started message, click **Continue**. The **GitHub Integration** screen will then display the count of teams and repositories, refreshing every 5 seconds. Allow a few minutes for the complete import of all data.

        /> 

4. On the **GitHub integration** screen:

    - Click **Go to Teams** to view the imported teams information on [Teams](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/teams).

**Assigning repositories to New Relic Teams**

You can auto-assign GitHub repositories to their teams by adding `teamOwningRepo` as a custom property in GitHub. 

1. Create the custom property at the organization level and assign a value for the custom property at the repository level. Additionally, you can set up a custom property for multiple repositories at the organization level simultaneously.
2. Then, in New Relic Teams, enable the [Automated Ownership](/docs/service-architecture-intelligence/teams/manage-teams/#assign-ownership) feature, making sure to use `team` as the tag key.

Once this is set up, we'll automatically match each repo with its correct team.

For more information on creating custom properties, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
