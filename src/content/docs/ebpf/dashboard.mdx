The eBPF Network dashboard provides deep visibility into your system's network health by tracking critical DNS and TCP metrics directly from the kernel. You can diagnose connectivity issues by analyzing success and failure rates for DNS resolutions and TCP connections. Pinpoint performance bottlenecks by monitoring key latencies like TCP handshakes, packet delivery, and the duration of short-lived connections. The dashboard also helps you track data throughput by visualizing bytes sent, received, and any packets dropped. 

To configure the eBPF network dashboard:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**.
2. In the **Dashboards**, click **+ Create a dashboard**.
3. In the **Create a dashboard** window, click **Browse pre-built dashboards**.
4. In the search bar, type **eBPF** and select the **eBPF**.
5. *(Optional)* In the displayed window, click **Edit** to change the account.
6. Click **Setup eBPF Agent** to setup the data source or click **Skip this step** if the eBPF agent is already setup.
7. Click **View dashboard** to view the data collected by the eBPF agent.

    The eBPF agent automatically generates entity names differently depending on the environment:

    * In hosts or Docker, these names are a combination of the process name, its directory or container ID, and the listening port. For example, `ruby:/home/ubuntu/app:[5678]` or `java:f4aead533895:[8080]`.

    * In Kubernetes, these names are derived from the service name for example, `mysql-database-service`.
