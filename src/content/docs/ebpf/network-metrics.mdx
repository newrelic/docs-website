<Callout title="Preview">
We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

This feature is currently provided as part of a preview pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/). It is not available to customers subject to HIPAA or FedRAMP regulations.

The eBPF network monitoring provides deep visibility into your system's network health by tracking critical DNS and TCP metrics directly from the kernel. You can diagnose connectivity issues by analyzing success and failure rates for DNS resolutions and TCP connections. Pinpoint performance bottlenecks by monitoring key latencies like TCP handshakes, packet delivery, and the duration of short-lived connections. The dashboard also helps you track data throughput by visualizing bytes sent, received, and any packets dropped. 

The network metrics has following tabs to monitor different aspects of network performance:

* Errors: Displays DNS, TCP, and other network-related errors.
* Latency: Monitors key latencies like TCP handshakes, packet delivery, and the duration of short-lived connections.
* Packet loss: Tracks any packets dropped during transmission. It also contains information such as Kernel packet dropped, TCP connection timeouts, and packet retransmitted.
* TCP flags: Displays the status flags for TCP connections for both inbound and outbound traffic.
* Connections: Displays the inbound and outbound TCP connections, connection count, average connection duration, and max connection duration.


## Enroll to eBPF network monitoring [#enroll-pp]

You can enroll to eBPF network monitoring from the <DNT>**Preview & Trials**</DNT> page:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal)**</DNT>.
2. From the left nav, click <DNT>**Preview & Trials**</DNT>.
3. From the list of available preview features, click <DNT>**eBPF network monitoring**</DNT>.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and accept the terms & conditions to complete the onboarding. Now, you can experience the new eBPF network monitoring capabilities from the APM.


## View the eBPF network monitoring data [#view-network-data]

You can view the eBPF network monitoring data in the New Relic APM UI:


1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM & Services**.
2. Select the desired eBPF entity.
3. In the Monitor section, click **Network Metrics**.
    The network metrics displays.


<Callout variant="tip">

The eBPF agent automatically generates entity names differently depending on the environment:

    * In hosts or Docker, these names are a combination of the process name, its directory or container ID, and the listening port. For example, `ruby:/home/ubuntu/app:[5678]` or `java:f4aead533895:[8080]`.

    * In Kubernetes, these names are derived from the service name for example, `mysql-database-service`.

Assigning custom name to applications:

    * You can assign a name of your choice to your application by setting the `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variable for both docker containers and on-host applications.

    * The named application will appear in the New Relic UI suffixed with `-ebpf`.
