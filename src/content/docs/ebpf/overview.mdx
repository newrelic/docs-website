Monitoring modern applications is challenging because they often run on complex infrastructure, such as Kubernetes clusters and traditional Linux hosts. As you scale these environments, it becomes more difficult to gain visibility into performance without significant manual configuration.  

Imagine your team manages a diverse estate:

* On one side, a critical service on a Linux server experiences intermittent slowdowns. Is the root cause in the application, a misconfigured dependency, or the host's resources? 
* On the other side, tracing requests across the complex networking of a Kubernetes cluster is a significant challenge. 

In both scenarios, you must sift through disconnected metrics and logs to find the root cause, slowing down incident resolution.

The New Relic extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) agent addresses these challenges. It provides a unified, automated view across your entire Linux estate by collecting rich, service-level telemetry directly from the kernel. This approach provides deep visibility into all your applications without requiring you to make any code changes.

New Relic eBPF agent to help you to monitor your entire system health in the following ways:

* Zero-code instrumentation to gain deep visibility into application performance without modifying application code or deploying language-specific agents. This approach reduces operational overhead and accelerates time-to-value across your entire infrastructure.

* Automatically discover services to continuously identify and map all running services and their dependencies. This provides a real-time view of your application's architecture.

    * In Kubernetes, the agent uses the cluster's service-level information to provide native context for your applications.
    * On Linux hosts, it derives service names from environment variables or the underlying process information, giving you a clear view of application behavior.

* Unified telemetry across environments to provide consistent visibility across your entire estate, whether you are running applications in Kubernetes or on traditional Linux hosts.

* Service-level performance analysis to gain insights into service interactions, request rates, latency, and errors. This helps you understand how your applications perform in real-world scenarios.

* Language-agnostic visibility to monitor applications written in any language, whether they are modern microservices or legacy applications. This allows you to use a single tool for all your monitoring needs.

* Low-resource overhead to minimize the impact on system performance while collecting detailed telemetry data. This ensures that your monitoring does not interfere with application performance.
