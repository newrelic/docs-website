New Relic eBPF observability helps you to monitor modern and complex environments by providing a new layer of visibility.

## What value does the eBPF agent provide? [#value]

New Relic eBPF observability provides unified, zero-code visibility across Kubernetes and Linux host environments. It uses the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology in the Linux kernel to deliver automated, language-agnostic insights. This approach reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need for manual instrumentation or code changes.

## Use cases [#use-cases]

This solution addresses critical challenges for platform engineers:

* **Faster troubleshooting:** Correlate application telemetry with infrastructure and network insights. This enables rapid diagnosis of performance issues, especially those that originate in the underlying system.

* **Automatic discovery:** Get automated observability with zero instrumentation. The eBPF agent continuously identifies and maps all running services and their dependencies, providing a real-time architectural view of new or unknown workloads without requiring prior knowledge of the application's language.

* **Unified monitoring:** Monitor applications written in any language across diverse environments. This gives you consistent visibility and service-level performance analysis directly within the New Relic user interface.


## Impact [#impact]

You can achieve deeper observability and resolve issues more quickly with minimal resource overhead, ensuring that monitoring does not impact application performance. The agent provides unique kernel-level and network details for a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics.

{/* Monitoring modern applications is challenging because they often run on complex and mixed infrastructure, from Kubernetes clusters to traditional Linux hosts such as, virtual machines and cloud instances. As you scale these environments, it becomes more difficult to gain visibility into performance without significant manual configuration. An engineer needs to know what applications are running in their cluster and which ones are causing performance degradation. Sometimes, application performance suffers due to issues in the underlying infrastructure that application owners cannot resolve with application-level tools alone. 

Imagine your team manages a diverse estate:

* You need to troubleshoot fast, but correlating application telemetry with infrastructure insights is not easy.
* New workloads are deployed, but instrumenting them is a challenge because you don't own the code, the development team is external, or you're simply unaware the service exists. 

In both scenarios, you need a solution that provides broad visibility across your entire estate without requiring you to have prior knowledge of every application's language or architecture.

The New Relic eBPF agent addresses these challenges. It is a powerful, non-intrusive tool designed to address these challenges. It leverages the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), an industry-leading technology that provides a safe and efficient way to gain insights directly from the Linux kernel. Using this eBPF agent, you can get a unified, automated view across your entire Linux estate by collecting rich, service-level telemetry directly from the kernel. This approach provides deep visibility into all your applications without requiring you to make any code changes. */}


## Key features [#key-features]

The New Relic eBPF agent is designed to provide comprehensive observability for your Linux hosts and Kubernetes clusters. It offers a range of features that help you monitor your entire system health effectively:

* Zero-code instrumentation to gain deep visibility into application performance without modifying application code or deploying language-specific agents. This approach reduces operational overhead and accelerates time-to-value across your entire infrastructure.

* Automatically discover services to continuously identify and map all running services and their dependencies. This provides a real-time view of your application's architecture.

    * In Kubernetes, the agent uses the cluster's service-level information to provide native context for your applications.
    * On Linux hosts, it derives service names from environment variables or the underlying process information, giving you a clear view of application behavior.

* Unified telemetry across environments to provide consistent visibility across your entire estate, whether you are running applications in Kubernetes or on traditional Linux hosts.

* Service-level performance analysis to gain insights into service interactions, request rates, latency, and errors. This helps you understand how your applications perform in real-world scenarios.

* Language-agnostic visibility to monitor applications written in any language, whether they are modern microservices or legacy applications. This allows you to use a single tool for all your monitoring needs.

* Low-resource overhead to minimize the impact on system performance while collecting detailed telemetry data. This ensures that your monitoring does not interfere with application performance.

* Deep visibility of kernel and user space interactions to provide insights into how applications interact with the underlying system. This helps you to capture and trace events in real-time.

* Rich metadata to collect granular-level details about system operations to help you in troubleshooting and performance analysis.

## How the eBPF agent works [#how-it-works]

The New Relic eBPF agent is deployed using helm charts in Kubernetes and using Debian/RPM packages on Linux hosts. It runs as a `daemonset` in Kubernetes or as a system service on Linux hosts. Once installed, the agent automatically detects all the running services and applications in your environment. These applications are integrated into New Relic's APM & Service UI under the eBPF entities. 

The New Relic eBPF agent has two modes:

* **Discover mode:** To automatically discover applications in your environment without active monitoring. This mode is suitable for initial setup or less intrusive monitoring.
* **eAPM mode:** To unlock a deeper level of observability by actively monitoring applications and collecting low-level metrics for a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics.
