In the software industry, a **tag** typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability.

At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like `team: operations`) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster). We make some important [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags.

You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example:

![New Relic filtering workloads using tags](./images/new-relic-tags-workloads_0.png "New Relic filtering workloads using tags")
<figcaption>
  Here you can see an `accountId` tag being used to filter [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) to a specific account.
</figcaption>

Tags help you to:

* Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts.
* Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example [use cases](#org-examples)).
* Better organize and search dashboards and [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster).
* [Query and chart APM data](#query-apm-tags).

Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, [custom attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/data/customize-data/collect-custom-attributes) or [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/report-custom-event-data) are a better solution.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Tags were previously called `labels` in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see `label`in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a `label` config option for tags.
</Callout>

## Tag format and limits [#formatting]

Format requirements and limits for tags:

* The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity:
  * Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration.
  * Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API.
* The following are maximum character length for tags:
  * Key: 128 characters
  * Value: 256 characters
* When [using our API to add tags](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial), a dash (`-`) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `` `key-name` ``).

## Best practices and tips [#tag-best-practices]

Before [adding tags](#tag-sources), we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them.

### Tips on keeping tags simple: [#simple-tips]

* Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion.
* Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See [character limits](#formatting).)
* When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, `region: EMEA` is better than `Param8323 : 1229072`).
* Avoid including several values like `regions: EMEA | US | LATAM` in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like `region: emea`, `region: us`, and `region: latam`. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI.

### Tips on using tags consistently: [#consistent-tips]

* Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities.
* Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both `region: emea` and `reg: emea`.
* Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both `camelCase` and `kebab-case`.
* Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both `env: staging` and `env: Staging`.

### Tips on cross-team implementation: [#organization-tips]

Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force.

We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then:

* Keep this reference manual up to date.
* Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the [API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial) or Terraform.
* Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards.

## Tag examples [#org-examples]

Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="team-tags"
    title="Team-related tags"
  >
    Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue.

    Team examples:

    * `team: backend`
    * `team: frontend`
    * `team: db`

    Role examples:

    * `roles: architecture`
    * `roles: devops`
    * `roles: pm`

    Region examples:

    * `region: emea`
    * `region: america`
    * `region: asia`
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="environment-tags"
    title="Environment-related tags"
  >
    You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples:

    * `env: production`
    * `env: qa`
    * `env: development`
    * `env: staging`
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="criticality-tags"
    title="Criticality-related tags"
  >
    You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues.

    Examples:

    * `layer: level1`
    * `layer: level2`
    * `layer: level3`
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## How tags are added [#tag-sources]

Some important [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute), by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags.

Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-via-ui-api"
    title="Add tags via UI or API"
  >
    When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity.

    To add or delete tags via the UI:

    1. Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host.
    2. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the **See metadata and manage tags** menu.
    3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.
    4. For APM agents, restart your service. 

    To manage tags via API: see our [NerdGraph tagging docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial). For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see [our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/5-mins-tag-resources/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-tags-apm-agents"
    title="APM agent tags"
  >
    You can add tags [via the UI and API](#add-via-ui-api) or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: 

* Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). 
* Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. 

Here are links to the agent configuration options: 

    * C SDK: not available
    * [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#labels)
    * [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration#labels)
    * [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#h3-labels)
    * [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#labels)
    * [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-labels)
    * [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#labels)
    * [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#labels)

  <Collapser
    id="add-tags-infrastructure"
    title="Infrastructure data tags"
  >
    There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services:

    * Use the [UI or API](#add-via-ui-api) to add tags at the entity level.
    * Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add [custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#custom-attributes), which are also available as tags in the UI.
    * [On-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list): some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific `labels` config options (for an example, see the labels config for the [Apache integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-monitoring-integration#config)).
    * [Cloud service integrations](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#cloud-integrations): by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side.

## Use tags to filter the UI [#filter-ui]

![New Relic advanced tag filter query](./images/new-relic-advanced-tag-filter-query.png "New Relic advanced tag filter query")

<figcaption>
  Use the filter field at the top of the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions.
</figcaption>

To filter down to certain entities using tags:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Explorer**.
2. Click the **Filter by...** field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags.
3. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options.

To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options:

* From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
  icon.

  OR
* Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the <Icon name="fe-info"/>
  icon.

To use the API to view tags, see our [NerdGraph docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial).

Learn about [how to use tags with dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards#filter-dashboards) and [how to use tags with workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads).

## Custom queries, charts, and alerts [#query-tags]

Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to query tag data, or create [NRQL condition alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions). 

### Query and alert on APM tags [#query-apm-tags]

You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum [agent versions](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent): 

* C: not available
* Go: 2.3.0
* Java: 4.9.0
* .NET: 8.17
* Node: v4.13.0
* PHP: not available
* Python: v4.10.0.112
* Ruby: 6.1.0.352

Here are some query examples: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="apm-shard-distribution"
    title="Throughput across shards"
  >

Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an `environment`, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a [wildcard](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/metric-data/query-metric-data-type/#query-multiple-metrics-wildcards) query like: 

```
SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) 
  FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' 
  FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES 
```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm-team-tag"
    title="Transactions per team"
  >

To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: 

```
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) 
  WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' 
  FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES   
```
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="apm-errors-team"
    title="Alert on error rate for teams"
  >

You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called `team-b`. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. 

```
FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) 
  WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName
```

Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: 

```
From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) 
  WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment 
```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Query and alert on attributes

As explained in the [tag sources information](#tag-sources), some important [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), and create [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions).
