Use the entity explorer to access the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, and hosts.

For more about entities, see [What is an entity?](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic)

## View entities [#find]

To use the entity explorer: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com)** and select **Entity explorer**.

Your monitored entities are on the left. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all.

The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include:

* **Services**: [APM](/docs/apm)-monitored applications and services monitored.
* **Hosts**: your monitored [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) (your servers and hosts).
* **Mobile applications**: your [mobile apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring).
* **Browser applications**: your front-end [browser apps](/docs/browser).
* **Integration-reported data**: data from services monitored by [our integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations), including our [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Health (alert) status [#alert-status]

The entity explorer shows a color-coded [alert](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts) status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress.

![New Relic One entity alert status](./images/new-relic-one-entity-alert-status-red.png "new-relic-one-entity-alert-status.png")

* To see what an alert status means, mouse over it.
* To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity.

[NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities.

<Callout variant="important">
  Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM [data retention guidelines](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/overview-data-retention-components#apm), applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-feature-end-of-life-announcements/105772).

## Filter by tag or entity name [#filter-tag]

There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities:

* Filter entities by tags: Use **Filter with tags** at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with `production`, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see [Tagging](/docs/using-tags).
* Filter by entity name: Use **Search services by name** at the top of the page.

## Entity data retention [#data-retention]

Availability of data depends on these factors:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Scope
      </th>

      <th>
        Data retention
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Entity explorer and search
      </td>

      <td>
        In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Our database (accessible via [NRQL query](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql))
      </td>

      <td>
        For querying our database (for example, via the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) or data explorer), availability is dependent on the [data retention](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-retention-stored-data) for that data type.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.
