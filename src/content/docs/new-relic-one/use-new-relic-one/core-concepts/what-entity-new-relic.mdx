New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of **entities**. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. 

## What's an entity? [#what-is-entity]

From a New Relic perspective, **entity** is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute) `entityGuid`. 

An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a [workload](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. 

Also very important is the [relationships between entities](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial). Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities.   

Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you **practical information about your business-important entities**, and **not** give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems.

## Find and explore entities and entity data [#find]

<Callout variant="tip">
You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. [Learn more about entity synthesis.](#entity-synthesis)
</Callout>

Some tips for finding and understanding entity data:

* To find an entity's `entityGuid` and `entityName` and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts), click an entity's <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon, and click **See metadata and tags**.
* For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute [`entityGuid`](/?event=SyntheticCheck&attribute=entityGuid). For workloads, it's `workloadGuid`. You can run [NRQL queries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to find entities by their GUID.
* To see connections between entities, you have several options: 
  * When viewing an entity in the UI, use the [**Related entities** UI](#related-entities). 
  * [Service maps](/docs/service-maps-dependencies-new-relic-one). 
  * [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing-new-relic-one). 
  * [Our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial).
* To group entities together, see [Group entities](#group). 
* [Customize entity definitions and relationships.](#entity-synthesis)
* To learn technical details about entity types, see our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/tree/main/definitions). In an entity type's `definition` file, you'll see information like:
  * The `domain`: for example, `APM`, or `Infra`.
  * Its `type`: for example, `Application` or `AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE`. 
  * Default [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data).
  * The `entityExpirationTime`: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from [database data retention](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention).  

## Group and organize entities [#group]

You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center.

To group your entities, see:

* [Tag entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).
* [Create workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-new-relic-one-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster), which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. 
* [Create entities and customize entity data](#entity-synthesis)

## Customize entity data with entity synthesis [#entity-synthesis]

If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. 

To learn more: 
* For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. 
* For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see [our GitHub repo on entity synthesis](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions#entity-definitions). 

### Reserved attributes for synthesized entities [#reserved-attributes]

These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. **Do not** set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `entity.guid`
      </td>

      <td>
        Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the `entity.guid` attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities.

        One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the `entity.guid` attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `entity.name`
      </td>

      <td>
        This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities.

        If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, [entity synthesis definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions#entity-definitions)). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `entity.type`
      </td>

      <td>
        This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field.

        While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding `entity.type` in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries.

        This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Entity relationships [#related-entities]

Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a "calls/called-by" relationship between them.

When viewing a specific entity in either the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts), Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its **Related entities** in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack.

<Callout variant="tip">

When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the "Add/edit related entities" link in **Related entities**.

  Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities.

      <td>
        Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the `DurationByCaller` metric. The callee reports the metric.

        For example, the metric `DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all` indicates that the caller is `APPLICATION 1234` for account 100.

      <td>
        An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the `ExternalApp` metric.   

        For example, the metric `ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all` indicates that the callee is `APPLICATION 1234` for account 100.

        The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller.

      <td>
        When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the  metric `ClientApplication`.    
        
        For example, the metric `ClientApplication/100#1234/all` indicates that the caller is `APPLICATION 1234` for account 100.
      </td>

        CALLS
      </td>

      <td>
        A datastore instance 
      </td>

      <td>
        When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the `DatastoreInstance` metric.

        For example, the metric `Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306` indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306.

        This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format `Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306`.

        Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it.

### Manual relationships? [#manual-relationships]

As a user, you can create relationships on top of the ones created automatically by new relic.

To do that, you'll need to use our nerdgraph api.

* Relationships can be created/replaced by using the mutation `entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace`. As its name suggest, it will allow you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type.
If the relationship already exists between the two entities, this will be added again with the given values changed (basically the creation time and the creator user id)

```graphql
mutation {
  entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(
    sourceEntityGuid: "{SourceEntityGuid}", 
    targetEntityGuid: "{TargetEntityGuid}", 
    type: BUILT_FROM
  ) {
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

* Relationships, can also be deleted by using the mutation `entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete`

```graphql
mutation {
  entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete(
    sourceEntityGuid: "{SourceEntityGuid}", 
    targetEntityGuid: "{TargetEntityGuid}", 
    type: BUILT_FROM
  ) {
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```
source and target are mandatory, whereas type its not.
If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed.

* You can find informaction about fetching relationships in this [relationships-api-tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial/)

#### Some considerations [#some-relationships-considerations]

* Two entities can have multiple relationships. One for each relationship type
* Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account
* For each entity, a user can manually define up to 2000 relationships. when the limit is reached, a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error will be returned from the api
* Each mutation can fail if the user do not have access to one of the two entieies (source/target)

The list of types that a relationship can have is described below.

Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are:

  <thead>
    <tr>

        **Type**
      </th>

      <td>
        `CONTAINS`
      </td>

      <td>
        The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the `HOST` contains a container.
