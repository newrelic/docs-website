The [Insights Dashboard API](/docs/apis/insights-apis/insights-dashboard-api/) is deprecated, but you can use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards.

If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new [Dashboards API](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-api).

## Why a new dashboards API? [#why-new-api]

Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the [New Relic One platform](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one/). To learn more about this transition and new features, see the [Insights to New Relic One migration guide](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights/).

The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The [Insights query API](/docs/apis/insights-apis/query-insights-event-data-api) will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. 

## Get started with NerdGraph [#starting-out]

[NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own [user key](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).

When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) are [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. 

If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) and some of [Create dashboards with NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/create-widgets-dashboards-api/).

The NerdGraph API explorer is located at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

## Operations mapping table [#operations-mapping-table]

The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API.

| Insights API operation  | NerdGraph API query/mutation  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| List (GET)      | [entitySearch()](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/dashboards-api-migration-insights-api-nerdgraph/#entitysearch)           | View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. |
| Show (GET)      | [entity()](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/dashboards-api-migration-insights-api-nerdgraph/#entityquery)                  | View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. |
| Create (POST)   | [dashboardCreate()](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/dashboards-api-migration-insights-api-nerdgraph/#dashboard-create)    | Create a new dashboard. |

## Dashboard properties mapping table [#dashboard-properties-mapping-table]

For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at [NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

The table below maps dashboard properties from the Insights API to the new dashboards API.

| Insights API dashboard property  | NerdGraph API dashboard property  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| id                    | guid        | ID of the New Relic entity the dashboard now represents |

| filter                | -           | Not translated to New Relic One yet |

## Widget properties mapping table [#widget-properties-mapping-table]

For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at [NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

The table below maps widget properties from the Insights API to the new dashboards API.

| Insights API dashboard property  | NerdGraph API dashboard property  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| id                                    | id                                | |
| account_id                            | -                                 | Translated into widget configuration for those that require one |
| visualization                         | visualization                     | |
| presentation.title                    | title                             | |
| presentation.drilldown_dashboard_id   | linkedEntities                    | Used to link a widget to a dashboard for the [facet linking](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) feature |

## Visualizations mapping table [#visualization-mapping-table]

We have simplified our widget visualizations by grouping the ones that were in fact the same but obtained through different types of queries. For instance, a line widget is plotted the same way regardless of the type of query: old `line_chart` vs. `comparison_line_chart` in Insights.

| Insights API visualization  | NerdGraph API visualization  |
|---|---|
|uniques_list|viz.table|
|single_event|viz.table|
|facet_table|viz.table|
|event_table|viz.table|
|faceted_area_chart|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.application_breakdown|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.scope_breakdown|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.browser_breakdown|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.background_breakdown|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.solr_breakdown|viz.area|
|predefined_metric_chart.gc_runs_breakdown|viz.area|
|facet_bar_chart|viz.bar|
|billboard|viz.billboard|
|attribute_sheet|viz.billboard|
|billboard_comparison|viz.billboard|
|gauge|viz.bullet|
|event_feed|viz.event-feed|
|funnel|viz.funnel|
|heatmap|viz.heatmap|
|histogram|viz.histogram|
|inventory|infra.inventory|
|raw_json|viz.json|
|line_chart|viz.line|
|comparison_line_chart|viz.line|
|faceted_line_chart|viz.line|
|metric_line_chart|viz.line|
|markdown|viz.markdown|
|facet_pie_chart|viz.pie|

## Examples: from REST endpoints to GraphQL queries/mutations [#from-rest-to-mutation]

One of the main benefits of NerdGraph being a GraphQL-format API is that it provides a complete and understandable description of the APIs' data. By using the [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer), you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation.

We want to facilitate your migration from the [Insights API](/docs/apis/insights-apis/insights-dashboard-api/) to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations.

### List (GET) -> entitySearch query [#entitysearch]

Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem.

Try it out using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

              entities {
                ... on DashboardEntityOutline {
                  guid
                  name
                  accountId
                }
              }

          }
        }
      }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Show (GET) -> entity query [#entityquery]

In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query.

Try it out using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="get-dashboard"
    title="Get dashboard info given its entity guid"
  >
    ```
      {
        actor {
          entity(guid: "<var>MY_DASHBOARD_GUID</var>") {
            ... on DashboardEntity {
              guid
              accountId
              name

              owner { email userId }
              pages {
                guid
                name
                createdAt
                updatedAt
                description
                owner { email userId }
                widgets {
                  id
                  visualization { id }
                  title
                  layout { row column height width }
                  rawConfiguration
                  linkedEntities { guid }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation [#dashboard-create]

Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the `dashboardCreate` mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about [how to build dashboard widgets](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/create-widgets-dashboards-api).

Try it out using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="create-dashboard"
    title="Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page"
  >
    ```
      mutation {
        dashboardCreate(accountId: <var>1</var>, dashboard: {
          name: "My awesome dashboard",
          permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE,
          pages: [{

### Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation [#dashboard-update]

The `dashboardUpdate` mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about [how to build dashboard widgets](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/create-widgets-dashboards-api).

Try it out using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).
