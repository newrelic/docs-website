<Callout variant="important">
  As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

[New Relic Insights](/docs/insights) was previously our main way to create custom queries and charts, but now we have [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights.

This transition guide will:

* Explain some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features
* Explain why it's easy to switch to New Relic One
* Give you some tips for how to get the most out of using New Relic One
* Explain some details and considerations about making the switch

## Improved features in New Relic One [#features]

New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more.

Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights.

Features include:

* Better querying and charting experiences, including a ["basic" query mode](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-basic-mode-specify-data) that doesn't require knowledge of [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).
* Better display options, including easier-to-understand displays for line-heavy, dense charts and a better [TV mode](/docs/dashboard-tv-mode).
* Dashboards with up to 12 charts/widgets across (compared to Insights' 3-across limit).
* Easier creation of [dashboards with multiple pages](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/create-dashboards-have-multiple-pages) (previously called [data apps](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/data-apps-build-collections-linked-dashboards) in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One.
* Improved experience for querying metric data (both the [`Metric` data type](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data) and [metric timeslice data](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql))

## Try out New Relic One [#switch]

It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the [recommendations](#recommendations) before you do.

To view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click **Try new dashboards**.

## Recommendations

The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: **If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards**. This is because, for [some types of dashboards](#notes-caveats), the improved features in New Relic One means a dashboard created there may lose functionality when edited in Insights.

That is the main thing to remember when switching to New Relic One dashboards.

Here are more details and specifics, including details about the above recommendation:

* Some dashboards, once edited in New Relic One, will lose some functionality when edited in Insights. This applies to these dashboards:
  * Dashboards created using the [Insights metric explorer](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/metric-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents). When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights.
  * Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One.
* Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called "data apps." When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the **Data apps** section.
* Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following **Manage data** UI pages will remain in Insights for now:

  * **Summary** UI page
  * **Add data** UI page
  * **Embeddables** UI page
  * **Lookup tables** UI page
  * **API keys** UI page
  * **Formatter** UI page

  To find these pages: go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Manage data**.
* There are no dashboard-related APIs. Currently, there are no New Relic One dashboard-related APIs. These APIs are a work-in-progress.
