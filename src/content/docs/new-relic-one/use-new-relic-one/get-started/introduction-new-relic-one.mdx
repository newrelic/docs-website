[New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com) is the platform that gives you access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform), our [Full-Stack Observability](/docs/full-stack-observability/monitor-everything/get-started-new-relic-monitoring-tools/get-started-full-stack-observability#h2-start-anywhere) features, and our [Applied Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence) tools. With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system.

## Quickly understand context [#context]

We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity!

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "350px" }}>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details.
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the [New Relic Navigator](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-navigator) to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the [New Relic Lookout](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-lookout) to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations.

        Add [tags](/docs/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) to all your entities. Or [create tags](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/graphql-tagging-api-tutorial) for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems.

## Query your data more easily [#chart-builder]

On the **Browse data** menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces).

Wherever you go in the UI, **Query your data** is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts:

* Browse your data in a query-less experience with our [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
* Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the [NRQL mode query builder](/docs/specify-data-chart#use-advanced).
* [Run PromQL-style queries](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-promql-style-mode-query-data) in the query builder.

## Enhanced dashboards [#dashboards]

</figcaption>

New Relic One [dashboards](/docs/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include:

* Perform [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
* [Manage your charts and dashboards](/docs/explore-dashboards-index) easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options.
* Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time.
* Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics.
* [Send data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights) to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs.
* Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are [available as New Relic One dashboards](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights).
</Callout>

## Build on New Relic One [#build]

If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that:

* Live on [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), alongside your other New Relic-monitored data.
* Feature highly tailored visualizations.
* Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API.

And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps.

To learn more, see [New Relic One applications](/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction).
