Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see [How to use service maps](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/how-use-service-maps).

## Requirements [#requirements]

The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Feature**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Requirements**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        App visibility
      </td>

      <td>
        For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true:

        * Your app must have the [minimum agent version required for distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing) and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: [Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/transition-guide-distributed-tracing#maps-no-browser-mobile).
        * Your app must have the [minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing](/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/troubleshooting-cross-application-tracing#agents) and have cross app tracing enabled.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Host and instance visibility
      </td>

      <td>
        To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the [APM database and instance feature](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues#compatibility) and use any of the compatible database drivers.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Database-only visibility
      </td>

      <td>
        APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps **without** the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the [**Database and slow queries** features](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-page#availablity).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create maps [#creating-maps]

The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps**.

To create a new map:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Start from scratch: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map <Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
     **.
   * Copy an existing map: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new**.
2. Name your map.
3. [Rearrange, group](#select-arrange-group-nodes), or [add nodes](#add-nodes) on the map as needed.

<Callout variant="important">
  Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account.
</Callout>

## Save and rename maps [#save-rename-share-maps]

Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="saving"
    title="Save"
  >
    * To save changes to a map, select **Save**.
    * To create a copy of the current map, select **Save as new**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="renaming"
    title="Rename"
  >
    To rename a map:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > (select a map)**.
    2. Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       icon next to the map name.
    3. Change the name, then select **Save**.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Add or remove nodes on maps [#add-nodes]

After you [create](#creating-maps) or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type.

To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove **X** icon.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="app-browser-db-nodes"
    title="Applications and mobile apps"
  >
    Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark <Icon name="fe-check"/>
    icon means that node is already on the map.

    To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service**.
    2. Select any applications from the **App/Service** list.
    3. [Rearrange or group](#select-arrange-group-nodes) together as needed.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="connected-nodes"
    title="Browser, databases, external services, connected apps"
  >
    In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map:

    1. Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget.
    2. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus <Icon name="fe-plus"/>
       icon.
    3. [Rearrange](#select-arrange-group-nodes) as needed.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="custom-nodes"
    title="Custom nodes"
  >
    To add a custom node to the map:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service**.
    2. From the **App/Service** list, select ![](./images/custom-node.png) **Create custom node**.
    3. Name the node.
    4. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow <Icon name="fe-arrow-right"/>
       icons. Then select the plus <Icon style={{color: '#B9D7B6'}} name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       icon on your target node.
    5. Select **Save**.
    6. [Rearrange](#select-arrange-group-nodes) as needed.

    To add or remove custom node connections:

    1. Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       icon.
    2. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow <Icon name="fe-arrow-right"/>
       icons.
    3. To add a connection, select the plus <Icon style={{color: '#B9D7B6'}} name="fe-plus-circle"/>
       icon.
    4. To remove a connection, select the minus <Icon style={{color: '#D75968'}} name="fe-minus-circle"/>
       icon.
    5. Select **Save**.

## Add maps and charts to dashboards [#dashboards]

![Add service maps to your dashboards](./images/map_in_dashboard.png "map_in_dashboard.png")

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from.
</figcaption>

You can add legacy service maps to a [dashboard](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards). For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system.

To add a service map to a dashboard:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and select the **Explorer**.
2. Select an entity from the index.
3. Click on **Service map**.
4. Click **Add to dashboard**. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to.

## Delete maps [#deleting]

To delete a map:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Service maps > (select a map)**.
2. Select the map name's pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon.
3. Select **Delete map**.

## Identify issues with external services [#identify-external-issues]

If your app connects to an [external service](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator:

* <Icon
    style={{color: '#A5C27C'}}
    name="fe-square"
  />
  Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline.
* <Icon
    style={{color: '#FCB95D'}}
    name="fe-square"
  />
  Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline.
* <Icon
    style={{color: '#D75966'}}
    name="fe-square"
  />
  Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline.
* <Icon
    style={{color: '#A8A8A8'}}
    name="fe-square"
  />
  Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status.
* <Icon
    style={{color: '#A67EAA'}}
    name="fe-square"
  />
  Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status.

    The **Discover your environment** feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment.

    To view all connected apps and services:

    1. In APM, select **Service maps**.
    2. From your **Map list**, select **Discover your environment** to display all of your nodes.
    3. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details.

    The **Discover your environment** feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See [Troubleshooting cross application tracing](/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/troubleshooting-cross-application-tracing#agents) for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements.

    Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the **Views** tab, then select **Traffic light mode**.

    When traffic lights mode is **On**, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default.

    When traffic lights mode is **Off**, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out.

    **Midnight mode** inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments.

    To toggle this mode, select the **Views** tab, then select **Midnight mode**.
