[New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one-overview) has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily.

## Search accounts and entities [#search]

The primary search bar is located at the top of all UI pages. Also, if your organization has [access to multiple New Relic accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data), an account selector appears at the top of some UI pages.

* You can search across all your New Relic accounts with [cross-account access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).
* Entities that cease to exist are [available in search for 8 days](/docs/new-relic-one-entity-explorer#data-retention).

## Use chart and query features [#data-analysis]

You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={250}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Start querying your data
      </td>

      <td>
        At the top of any UI page, select [**Query your data**](/docs/introduction-chart-builder).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View a chart's query
      </td>

      <td>
        For some charts, you can [view the NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language#what-is-nrql) used to generate that chart. You can use this to understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="select-time">
      <td>
        Choose time range
      </td>

      <td>
        Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Also, you can use the time picker, which is in the top right corner of the UI, and lets you select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="chart-details">
      <td>
        View chart details
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="turn-chart-elements-off-on">
      <td>
        Hide or return chart elements
      </td>

      <td>
        To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Share charts and pages [#share]

Use any of these options:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={250}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Embed a chart in a webpage
      </td>

      <td>
        Click **Get chart link** to get a URL for embedding a chart in a webpage. An embedded chart contains only the metrics present when it was created. If metrics cease being reported, they won't appear in the chart.

        In July 2020, our iframe-based chart-embed feature was updated. For details, see this [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/change-to-shareable-charts-in-apm-embedded-charts/102240).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Share entire UI page
      </td>

      <td>
        Copy the URL and share it with anyone who has New Relic access. The URL retains any chart time range settings.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="permalink">
        Create a permalink
      </td>

      <td>
        Click the <Icon name="fe-share"/>
        icon where available. The permalink also shortens the full New Relic One URL, which makes it easier to share.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Adjust account and user settings [#account-dropdown]

To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.

## Go directly to New Relic products [#products]

At the top of the UI are direct links to individual parts of New Relic One, such as APM, browser monitoring, and infrastructure monitoring. For more about the transition from what were previously separate products to the unified New Relic One platform, see the [New Relic One transition guide](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-transition-guide-july-2020).
