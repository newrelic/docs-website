New Relic gives you a framework to build your own React JavaScript applications that:

* Reside on the [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) platform, alongside your other dashboards and data.
* Feature visualizations that you've tailored specifically for your organization.
* Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from another service or API.

## Get started [#get-started]

Keep reading to learn more about what you can do with New Relic One apps. If you want to get started building quickly, first read the [requirements](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/permission-manage-apps).

## New Relic One: a programmable platform [#what-is-it]

We strive to have an automated user experience that provides optimal value for all users. But we also know that some organizations have unique business needs that can’t be met with our standard visualization options.

Now, we give you control over the fundamental building blocks of our platform. Using the same tools our engineers use to build New Relic One, you can build custom applications that align with your unique organizational structure and business needs. If you know how to use React, GraphQL, and NRQL (our query language), building an application will take you only a few minutes. Check out [these guides on our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps) for help building custom applications.

## Get started [#get-started]

For a quick overview of how to get started with building your own app, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 3:15 minutes).

With New Relic One, you can solve any data-driven challenge, no matter how complex. For example:

* Use our APIs to [get data into New Relic from any source](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/collect-data-from-any-source).
* [Visualize that data in your custom applications](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps).

  If your visualization needs are relatively simple, consider using [custom charts](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) and [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards).
