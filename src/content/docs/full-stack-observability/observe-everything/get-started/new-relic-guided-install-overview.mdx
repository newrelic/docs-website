Instrument your systems and send telemetry data to New Relic with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

 Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument.

## Why it matters [#why-it-matters]

With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes.

The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you.

Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs.

## Some technical detail [#technical-detail]

The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to whatâ€™s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration.

<Callout variant="important">
On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent.

All other integrations are only supported on Linux.
</Callout>

## On-host integration (OHI) recipes [#ohi-recipes]

The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command.

To install any individual on-host integration, run this command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<var>API_KEY</var> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<var>ACCOUNT_ID</var> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n <var>INTEGRATION-FLAG</var>
```

For example:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration
```

The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference.

Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

## Troubleshoot common problems [#troubleshoot]

As we identify areas where the guided install fails, we'll document them here and provide some troubleshooting guidance.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="mysql"
    title="MySQL: Incorrect user permissions"
  >

To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. 

These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions:

Create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password.

       ```
       sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<var>YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD</var>';"
       ```

Give replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

       ```
       sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
       ```

Give select privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

       ```
       sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
	   ```

Once done, your next guided install attempt should work.

    <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nginx"
    title="NGINX: No status URL "
  >

To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL.

`status_url`: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of `127.0.0.1` is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example:

    `status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status`

You can read more about the `status_url` in these NGINX docs:

* For NGINX Open Source: [HTTP stub status module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html)
* For NGINX Plus: [HTTP status module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html) and [HTTP API module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html)

There are different ways to set `status_url`, depending on how NGINX was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: See [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: See [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: Edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `nginx-config.yml`.
