## What are quickstarts	[#what-are-quickstarts]

Quickstarts are bundles of dashboards, alerts, and instrumentation that are ready to install with a single click, specific to each technology we support. Popular technologies such as Node.js, Python, and Ruby have full-featured quickstarts, while others contain a mixture of instrumentations, dashboards, and alerts. 

New Relic I/O is open source, which means that you can modify and improve existing quickstarts, or build new ones, to suit your needs. We thoroughly review external edit to our quickstarts for value and quality. Interested in contributing to the community?
