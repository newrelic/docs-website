Notification message templates enable you to customize your notification event data before it's sent to your third-party destination. The templates map your custom values to the values used by your third-party destination.

This gives you full control over what data will be sent and where, as well as being able to fully engage with the services you use.

## Message template variables [#variables]

A message template is what you use to convert New Relic event data to data that's consumable by your third-party service. Variables are specific attributes that are mapped to data fields in your third-party service.

Message templates are written in a simple templating language called [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/). Variables in the message templates are written as [expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) inside double curly braces `{{ }}`.

## The variables menu [#variables-menu]

The New Relic variable names are listed in the message template variables menu. The variables are grouped into subcategories.

In the variables menu, type `{{` to select from a list of variables. As you type, variable names appear via autocomplete. The variable type is written on the right-hand side. If the workflow has [enrichments](/docs/alerts/get-notified/alert-event-workflows/#enrichments), they'll appear at the top of the list after typing `{{`.

<Callout variant="important">
  Issue specific variables, such as `accumulations.tag.foo` won't appear unless there's already been an issue containing this metadata. To create a message template which includes them before an issue has occured, use the [`#if` statement](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#missing-attributes) described below.
</Callout>

## Use the Handlebars syntax [#handlebars-syntax]

When an event generates a notification, the message template uses the Handlebar variables to map the notification data to the fields used by your third-party service.

The Handlebars language provides many features in addition to basic variable replacement, including evaluating [nested input objects](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#nested-input-objects) and functions, such as iterations (loops), conditional statements, and more. In Handlebars, these functions are called helpers.
Click [here](/docs/alerts/get-notified/custom-variables-alert-event-workflows/) for an explanation of the variables used for Workflows.

## Helper functions [#help-functions]

Our message templates support the Handlebars [built-in helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html).

In addition, we've added other helpers that might be useful to you.

    title="JSON"
  >
    The `{{json}}` helper converts text to a JSON element.

    Use this when you're configuring a Webhook’s payload, which uses a JSON syntax, and any other situation you might want to pass JSON formatted data.

    For example, with a variable called `data`.

    ```json
    {
      "data":{
        "tags":["infra, team-a"]
      }
    }
    ```

    To get the `tags` array as a JSON element, use the `{{json}}` helper:

    ```handlebars
    {{json data.tags}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```json
     ["infra","team-a"]
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="escape"
    title="Escape"
  >
    Similar to the `{{json}}` helper, the `{{escape}}` helper escapes JSON breaking characters, but doesn't generate JSON output.

    Use the escape helper when the value of the variable contains text with JSON-breaking characters, such as `"`, that must be escaped for the message template to have the correct syntax.

    For example, the following needs to be sent as text, such as when sending to a Slack webhook endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "text": "id:{{ escape issueId }},\nEnrichment Data: {{ escape [latest my_enrichment] }},\nDescription:{{ escape accumulations.conditionDescription }}"
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="equality"
    title="Equality"
  >
    Use the equality `{{#eq}}` helper to compare variables.

    ```handlebars
    Compares variables a and b, renders 'yes' or 'no':

    {{#eq a b}} yes {{else}} no {{/eq}}

    Compares string value "a" to variable b, renders 'yes' or 'no':

    {{#eq "a" b}} yes {{else}} no {{/eq}}

    Renders 'true' or 'false':

    {{eq a b}}

    Renders 'y' or 'n':

    {{eq a b yes='y' no='n'}}
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="contains"
    title="Contains"
  >
    Use the `{{#contains}}` helper to compare variables.

    ```handlebars
    Asserts that b contains a, renders 'yes' or 'no':

    {{#contains a b}} yes {{else}} no {{/contains}}

    Asserts that variable b contains string value "a", renders 'yes' or 'no':

    {{#contains "a" b}} yes {{else}} no {{/contains}}

    Renders 'true' or 'false':

    {{contains a b}}

    Renders 'y' or 'n':

    {{contains a b yes='y' no='n'}}
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="math"
    title="Math"
  >
    Use the `{{#math}}` to perform simple math operations.

    ```handlebars
    Renders addition of two number values:

    {{#math openIncidentsCount '+' closedIncidentsCount}} {{/math}}

    Renders subtraction of two number values:

    {{#math createdAt '-' closedAt}}{{/math}}

    Renders multiplication of two number values:

    {{#math 3 '*' 3}}{{/math}}

    Renders division of two number values:

    {{#math 9 '/' 3}}{{/math}}
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="timezone"
    title="Timezone"
  >
    Use the `{{#timezone}}` to convert epoch time to a date in the format of 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss zzz'.
    You can find a list of tz database timezones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

    Example #1: convert createdAt in epoch time to US Eastern timezone:

    ```handlebars
    {{#timezone createdAt 'US/Eastern'}}{{/timezone}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    "2023-06-06 09:45:07 EDT"
    ```

    Example #2: convert epoch time to Paris timezone::

    ```handlebars
    {{#timezone 1686059107319 'Europe/Paris'}}{{/timezone}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    "2023-06-06 15:45:07 GMT+2"
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="replace"
    title="Replace"
  >
    The `replace` helper replaces instances of the first parameter in the second parameter with the child block.

    Use `else` clause to specify what happens when no instance of the first parameter is found. If it is omitted an empty string will be generated.

    Example #1: replace the word `dog` with `cat` in the sentence `The dog likes to eat`:

    ```handlebars
    {{#replace "dog" "The dog likes to eat"}}cat{{/replace}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    The cat likes to eat
    ```

    Example #2: replace the word `cat` with `mouse` in the sentence `The dog likes to eat`:

    ```handlebars
    {{#replace "cat" "The dog likes to eat"}}mouse{{/replace}}
    ```

    to get an empty string:

    ```

    ```

    Example #3: replace the word `cat` with `mouse` in the sentence `The dog likes to eat`, using the `else` clause:

    ```handlebars
    {{#replace "cat" "The dog likes to eat"}}mouse{{else}}There is no cat to replace{{/replace}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    There is no cat to replace
    ```

    Example #4: replace the word `dog` with `cat` in the sentence `The DOG likes to eat` while ignoring case:

    ```handlebars
    {{#replace "/dog/i" "The DOG likes to eat"}}cat{{/replace}}
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    The cat likes to eat
    ```

    Example #5: replace the variable `{{needle}}` with the variable `{{replacement}}` in the variable `{{haystack}}`:

    ```handlebars
    {{#replace needle haystack}}{{replacement}}{{/replace}}
    ```

    using this data:

    ```json
    {
      "needle": "/dog/i",
      "haystack": "The DOG likes to eat",
      "replacement": "cat"
    }
    ```

    to get:

    ```
    The cat likes to eat
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Our helper functions can also be nested. Here is an example:

```handlebars
{{#eq "a" b}} yes1 {{else}}{{#eq "a" c}} yes2 {{else}} no {{/eq}}{{/eq}}
```

## Usage examples [#usage-examples]

The examples are based on a variable called `data`:

```json
"data": {
  "tags":["infra, team-a"],
  "id":123456789,
  "name": "Alice",
}
```

The `data` value has an equivalent, dot-notated format:

```json
"data.tags": ["infra, team-a"]
"data.id": 123456789
"data.name": "Alice"
```

### Validate data [#validate]

If `id` equals `123456789`, then the output is `valid`. If not, the output is `not valid`.

```handlebars
{{eq data.name "Alice" yes='valid' no='not valid'}}
```

If `name` equals `Alice`, then the output is `valid`.

### Return JSON [#json]

Get the `tags` and object’s properties in a JSON form:

```handlebars
{{json data.tags}}
```

This would return the following JSON:

```json
["infra","team-a"]
```

### Get values from an array [#array]

Get the first tag from the `tags` array:

```handlebars
{{json data.tags.[0]}}
```

This would return the first value from the array:

```
"infra"
```

### Iterate through an array [#iterate-array]

Iterate a variable of type array and aggregate the values into a string:

```handlebars
{{#each tags}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
```

The result contains the tags, seperated by commas (the trailing comma is omitted):

```
infra, team
```

Similarly, iterate the `data` variable, aggregate the object’s values, and output a JSON element:

```handlebars
{{#each (json data)}}{{this}}{{/each}}
```

This would return a JSON such as:

```json
{
  "tags":["infra, team-a"],
  "name":"Alice",
  "id":"123456789"
}
```

Iterate the `data` variable, then aggregate the object’s entries to a string:

```handlebars
{{#each data}}{{@key}}: {{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
```

This would return a string such as:

```
tags: infra,team-a, name: Alice, id: 123456789
```

### Handle missing attributes [#missing-attributes]

In some cases, such as for tags that weren't present in previous issues, an attribute may be missing from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu), or not exist whatsoever.

We can use the `#if` statement to set a fallback, such as:

```handlebars
{{#if data.type}}{{ json data.type }}{{else}}"N/A"{{/if}}
```

This would return the string `"N/A"`.

<Callout variant="caution">
  If a missing attribute also has a nested value, rendering will fail, so we will not save the webhook payload. For example, the case:

  ```handlebars
  {{#if data.type}}{{ json data.type }}{{else}}"N/A"{{/if}}
  ```

  will need to be changed to:

  ```handlebars
  {{#if data}}{{#if data.type}}{{ json data.type }}{{else}}"N/A"{{else}}"N/A"{{/if}}
  ```
</Callout>
