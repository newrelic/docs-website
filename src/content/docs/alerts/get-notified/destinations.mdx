Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Atlassian Jira: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/), [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/).
* ServiceNow: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Slack: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/), [errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/), and [Discussions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/collaborate/collaboration-slack-integration/).
* Webhook: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* Email: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) and [Discussions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/collaborate/collaborate-with-teammates/).
* AWS EventBridge: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* PagerDuty: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* New Relic Mobile Push: Available in [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).

For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).

## Required permissions [#requirements]

Destination settings require specific [permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions):

* To access settings: `View` permissions for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.
* To modify or delete settings: `Modify` permissions for `Applied intelligence > Destinations` or `Alerts`.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Enrich and Notify > Destinations**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Destinations**</DNT> table shows information about the existing destinations and allows users to enable, disable, and modify.
2. To add a destination, click the appropriate platform tile. To modify destination settings, click the destination row in the destinations table.

You can also configure destinations with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-destinations).

## Destinations and Notifications Status [#destinations-and-notifications-statuses]

### Destination statuses [#destinations-statuses]

Destinations have a `status` value that indicates if we encountered issues while processing and sending events to them.

To track errors, it's recommended to visit the [Notifications-log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations/#notifications-log) and the [NrIntegrationError event](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events/#error-details).

Available statuses:

* `DEFAULT`: The integration works properly.
* `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`: This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a configuration error.
* `THROTTLING_WARNING`: This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a throttling error. The number of notification requests exceeds your third-party system's rate limitation.
* `UNINSTALLED`: The New Relic application isn't installed and this destination is no longer available (Applicable for Slack).
* `EXTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`: This destination isn't receiving notifications due to an external server error. For more information, please check your third-party system.
* `TIMEOUT_ERROR`: This destination isn't receiving notifications due to a timeout. For more information, please revisit the destination configuration and your third-party system status.
* `AUTH_ERROR`: This destination isn't receiving notifications. Please verify your destination credentials.
* `UNKNOWN_ERROR`: This destination isn't receiving notifications due to an unknown error.

You can view status of the destination in the <DNT>**Destinations**</DNT> table and in the <DNT>**Select a destination**</DNT> step while setting the channel template. You can also review the state using the Nerdgraph API  with the `status` property.

### Issue Notifications log [#notifications-log]

The [Issue notification log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#issue-notification-log) gives you a detailed record to keep track of all notifications generated by workflows. This information helps you troubleshoots issues, monitor workflow performance, and make sure that notifications are sent to the correct destinations. As a result, you can quickly identify any issues that may arise and take corrective action as needed.

### Error notifier [#Notifier-errors]

If, for any reason, a notification event fails to send, the consequential error will be sent to `NrIntegrationError` under the category `NotificationError`.

This is especially useful if using the <DNT>**Alert conditions (policies)**</DNT> and [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) features. This way, you can build a condition which triggers on the event of a notification error, and a new notification can be sent elsewhere.

A step-by-step demo of adding an error notifier can be found below:
<Video type="wistia" id="b89ctyjolq"/>

Example condition:

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM NrIntegrationError
WHERE category = 'NotificationError'
```

Then, you can use this condition in the query builder of the workflow configuration, where you can also define an event template.

### Snoozed destination [#Snoozed-destination]

Snoozing: In order to minimize error noise on faulty destinations, we "snooze" destinations. If a notification send to a specific destination fails within a period of two hours, we "snooze" the destination for a few minutes. In this period we won't send notifications to that destination.
