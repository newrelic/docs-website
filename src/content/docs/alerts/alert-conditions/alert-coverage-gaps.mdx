[Alert coverage gaps](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts/detection-gaps?state=323ebf9d-0bdd-0113-3ecf-1672544412e9) pinpoints areas in your stack where serious problems could go undetected. Coverage gaps exposes your <InlinePopover type="apm" />, <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, <InlinePopover type="mobile" />, and [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/introduction-key-transactions) entities that are missing alerts coverage, and makes it easy to fill in these gaps.

In an increasingly dynamic landscape, we know how important it's to stay on top of your stack and be proactively notified if anything goes wrong. But, as your team grows or changes, it can be hard to know if you're getting the alerts you need, when you need them. Alert coverage gaps give your team a comprehensive list of all entities that your team is not currently covering.

What does covering an entity mean? A covered entity means that you've set up an [alert](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms) to notify you of how a particular entity is performing. For example, you might have created an alert condition that opens an incident if the throughput of an APM entity exceeds 100 requests per minute. An uncovered entity is part of your system that is unmonitored which means there could be unhealthy behavior that goes unchecked. We created [alert coverage gaps](https://one.newrelic.com/nrai/detection-gaps/home) to highlight uncovered entities so your team doesn't miss valuable data and you can prevent incidents before they happen.

## Find your coverage gaps [#find-your-coverage-gaps]

To open the alert coverage gaps page, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> in the left navigation pane. There, you will see a list of all your entitites that are not currently covered.

Depending on the covered entities, this page can include tabs for APM, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and key transactions. If there are no uncovered entities for these capabilities, you won't see that specific tab.

  Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> in the left navigation pane. When you select this option you'll see a list of all your unmonitored entities.

## Create an alert from your alert coverage gaps [#create-an-alert]

Once you've selected an entity you'd like to monitor, then you can create an alert condition to notify your team of any abnormal behavior. Follow these steps to create an alert from your alert coverage gaps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> in the left navigation pane.

2. Select the entity you'd like to monitor. You can select more than one.

3. Click <DNT>**+ Recommend alert conditions**</DNT>.

    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_coverage-gaps-recommend-button.webp"
  />

4. The <DNT>**Add an alert**</DNT> page opens. Add the recommended conditons. Depending on the entity type, you can see different options. For example, for APM and key transactions, you'll see these options:

      src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_coverage-gaps-add-an-alert.webp"
    />

    <figcaption>
      To create an alert for an unmonitored entity, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts**</DNT>, click <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> in the left navigation pane. Select an entity and click <DNT>**+ Recommend alert conditions**</DNT>.
    </figcaption>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Click the <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button to edit the alert condition and modify the query and thresholds. 
    </Callout>

4. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.

5. Select a policy to get notified. Every alert condition needs to be routed through a [policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) so you have to either select an existing policy or create a new one.

      src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_coverage-gaps-add-an-alert-policy.webp"
    />

6. Click <DNT>**Activate conditions**</DNT> to save the conditions. If the policy is new, you'll see the <DNT>**Save & set up notifications**</DNT> button. Use this button if you want to save the conditions and the notifications.


## Adding recommended alerts [#adding-recommended-alerts]

New Relic will dynamically suggest the conditions we believe should be monitored based on the selected entity and your specific system. Some of the recommended alerts we might suggest are error percentage, throughput, or response time.

Recommended alert conditions are related to the entity type's defined as [Golden Metrics](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/blob/main/docs/entities/golden_metrics.md). We customize these conditions based on entity type and how each entity is instrumented.

To see which services need alert coverage, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Alert coverage gaps**</DNT> in the left navigation pane.

2. Click <DNT>**See what to instrument**</DNT>.

    />

3. The coverage gaps page opens. You can group your coverage gaps by integration or by account.
