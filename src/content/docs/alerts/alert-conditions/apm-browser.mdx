There are various ways to create alert conditions for New Relic <InlinePopover type="apm"/> and <InlinePopover type="browser"/> metrics, but we recommend using NRQL. Using a NRQL alert condition provides additional controls, improved detection time, and consistency across all data types.

Here's an example of how to can set up a condition for an APM-monitored application. Follow these steps:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT> and look for the service you want to create an alert condition.

    2. Click on the service.

    3. In the summary page, look for the <DNT>**Web transactions time**</DNT> graph and click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner.
    
    4. Select <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>.

    alt="Create an alert condition from APM & Services"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-services-apm.webp"
    />

    5. This opens a modal with the NRQL alert condition builder. You'll have 2 pre-populated queries to select one of them.

    alt="Create an alert condition from APM & Services"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-services-apm-queries.webp"
    />

    6. Select a query and click <DNT>**Select query**</DNT>. In the query, observe that any `LIMIT`, `SINCE...AGO`, and `TIMESERIES` clauses are removed so that the NRQL query syntax is valid.

      If no results are returned, ensure you're in the correct account by looking at the current account in the upper-left of the modal.
      If it's not correct, you may need to close out of the modal and double-check that the correct account is selected in the account picker in the upper-left corner of the page.

    />
    
    
    7. Set some thresholds to create the alert condition. See the [Create alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) document to know more about these settings.

      See [How metric timeslice data is converted](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-apm-metric-timeslice-data-nrql/#timeslice-conversion) on how the original APM timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics.
