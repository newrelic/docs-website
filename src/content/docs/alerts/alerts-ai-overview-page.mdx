On the <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> <DNT>**Overview**</DNT> page, you'll find a consolidated view of your current alert events. The <DNT>**Issues & activity**</DNT> page has views of your active issues and recent alert events.

## Why it matters [#why]

The <DNT>**Overview**</DNT> and <DNT>**Issues & activity**</DNT> pages provide analytics on how your system is (or isn't) performing. You can quickly switch between the [<DNT>**Overview**</DNT>](#summary), [<DNT>**Issues**</DNT>](#issues) and [<DNT>**Alert events**</DNT>](#alert-events) to scan for critical problems affecting your systems.

## Overview page [#summary]

The overview page shows a high-level view of recent and current alert events. With this page, you'll get quick insight into how many critical alert events you have, how many have been closed, and which policies are creating the most alert events. This page also shows the top sources of your muted alert events.

        A time series view that counts the number of alert events opened during a time period. This chart only tracks open events. It doesn't track the open or closed state of the alert event.

        This chart uses the same data as the time series chart of the same name. It quickly shows you the breakdown between warning and critical alert events. Click the pie chart to filter the whole page by warning or critical alert events.

        Closed alert event durations
      </td>

      <td>
        A distribution of how long each alert event was open (duration), before being closed. Generally, it's better to have shorter durations for your alert events. If you're seeing a lot of long duration alert events, you may want to write a custom filter to investigate those more deeply.

## Issues

On the <DNT>**Issues & activity**</DNT> page, issues are groups of alert events that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new alert event is created, alert event intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. An issue will contain arrays of all the tags (metadata) from all the alert events it contains.

The issues feed includes all of your issues and can be searched and filtered using the top of page component.

By default, the issues feed is filtered to only show the active issues. You can also filter by issue priority, source, alert condition, alert policiy, entity, or issue ID.

By default, issues are sorted by most recently created issue.

Click an issue to open its issue page.

## Alert events

On the <DNT>**Issues & activity**</DNT> page, alert events are events that describe the symptoms affecting your system over time. These symptoms are detected by your monitoring tools, which evaluate your data streams and events.

New Relic alert event metadata comes from any of the following sources:
* Inheriting all the tags from the alert condition that triggered it
* All the facets, values, and where conditions are added as tags if the NRQL alert condition contains a facet or where condition
* All the tags from an entity are added if the result of the NRQL alert condition can be mapped to that single entity

[External alert event](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/incident-event-rest-api/) medadata is what was received as tag.\*.

The alert events feed includes all of your alert events: New Relic alert events and external alert events.

You can filter the feed by source, alert event state, and priority.

### Default behavior [#default]

By default, the feed is sorted by last updated at the top.

Click an alert event's row to see the alert event's details.
