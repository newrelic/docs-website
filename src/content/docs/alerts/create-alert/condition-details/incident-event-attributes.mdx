A condition opening an incident generates an event, which passes important information downstream.

For more about the definition of incidents and other terms, see [our glossary](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/).

## What is an incident event? [#definition]

An [incident](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident) event is an event where a condition threshold defined in a an alert policy is breached. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features.

<Callout variant="important">
  The incident event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the incident event.

## `NrAiIncident` event attributes [#NrAiIncident-attributes]

This table shows incident event attributes. The incident event data type is collected in [NrAiIncident](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrAiIncident).

You may be wondering why we're using `NrAiIncident` as the name for the incident event data type. Although sometime you can see these events as "violations," they are called "incidents" in our UI.

All attributes are available for use in a [description](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/alert-condition-descriptions). Read about attributes available for [muting rules](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/muting-rules-suppress-notifications).

        `EVALUATOR`: Natural close because the metric has ceased to breach the threshold.

        `EXPIRED`: Incident closed due to TTL.

        `INCIDENT_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION`: A third party closed the issue or incident through an API call.

        `LABEL_BINDINGS_CHANGED`: The label was removed from the target, causing it to no longer be covered by the condition. This only applies to `APM/Mobile/Browser/Infrastructure` conditions.

        `LOSS_OF_SIGNAL`: Signal was lost, and incident was closed based on loss of signal settings.

        `MAINTENACE`: New Relic was performing maintenance and we closed the incident as part of it.

        `POLICY_DELETED`: Policy was deleted.

        `TARGET_REMOVED`: The target was removed from the condition.

        `USER`: Closed manually by a user.
