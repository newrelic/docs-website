Alert [conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) include the option to identify the URL for your [runbook](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-runbook) instructions. This allows you to link to information or standard procedures for handling an alert event opened when a situation breaches the condition's [critical threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert).

To edit the runbook URL associated with a condition:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert conditions (policies) > (select a policy) > (select a condition)**</DNT>.
2. On the <DNT>**Edit conditions**</DNT> page, click <DNT>**Add details**</DNT>, and then scroll down to <DNT>**Runbook URL**</DNT>. Provide the full path for your runbook URL (runbook URL, URL to internal wiki page, etc.).
3. Toggle <DNT>**Enable on save**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.
4. Optional: To change or delete an existing runbook URL from the alert condition, click <DNT>**Remove**</DNT>.

We'll include your runbook URL in <DNT>**Alert event**</DNT> details and in email notifications so that personnel will know exactly what to do.
