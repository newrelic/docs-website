<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> in New Relic uses historical data to build models that predict when a static threshold is going to be breached. You can specify how far into the future you want to predict, providing flexibility in your alerting strategy. When a value is predicted to reach the static threshold within the future window you have set, a predictive alert event triggers with the event title prefix <DNT>**Prediction:**</DNT>, allowing you to take corrective measures before potential disruptions occur.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic currently uses the [Holt-Winters model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)) for predicting, which supports hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal patterns and trends in your data.
</Callout>

To enable <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT>, enable <DNT>**[NRQL Predictions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/nrql-predictions)**</DNT> (Now in public preview), which provides the query functionality required for evaluation of predictive thresholds. The <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> and <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> features are available only to **[Advanced Compute](https://newrelic.com/pricing/compute#pricing_plan-compute)** customers. To enroll, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com//admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> and <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> features.

## Set predictive threshold for an alert condition [#set-predictive-threshold]
To set or update an alert condition with the predictive capability, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Edit or set up a new alert condition [#create-alert-condition]

    #### To edit an existing alert condition:
    1. Select an alert condition from <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>, and edit the <DNT>**Signal behavior**</DNT>.
    2. From the <DNT>**Signal behavior**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> page opens.


    
    #### To set up a new alert condition:
    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Alert Conditions**</DNT>.
    2. Click <DNT>**+ New alert condition > Use guided mode**</DNT>. You can also write a NRQL query to create an alert condition.
    3. If you are using the guided mode, follow the on-screen instuctions till you are at the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section. If you are writing a NRQL query, run the query to get the data on the chart, and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to get to the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> section.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set static thresholds [#set-static-thresholds]

  Under the <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT> section of the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> page, set a static threshold as follows:
      1. Select <DNT>**Static**</DNT>.
      2. Select severity level for the alert condition.
      3. Set the threshold value.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set predictive threshold [#set-predictive-threshold]
  
    1. Under <DNT>**Set condition thresholds**</DNT> section, enable the <DNT>**Predict future behavior**</DNT> toggle.
    2. Set a look-ahead time for the predictive threshold. This is how far you want to look into the future to predict the threshold breach.
        * **Minimum look-ahead time**: Two times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
        * **Maximum look-ahead time**: 360 times of the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
        <Callout variant="tip">
        To look further ahead into the future, you can increase the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration). 
        </Callout>
        <Callout variant="tip">
        When the window duration is set to 1 minute, the model utilizes historical data from the past 2.5 days to generate predictions. To increase the span of the historical data for model processing, you can increase the [window duration](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#window-duration).
        </Callout>        
        
    3. Set the predicted alert event behavior, when the actual signal crosses the threshold.
        * Close predicted alert event and open an actual alert event (recommended).
        * Continue to keep the predicted alert event open.

<Callout variant="tip">
  By selecting the <DNT>**Close predicted alert event and open one for the occurring event.**</DNT> option, you can distinguish between predicted and actual alert events.
</Callout>


  </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Save conditions [#save-conditions]
    Refer [Add alert condition details](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/#add-details) to complete the alert condition setup, and then save it.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Post-promotion behavior  [#post-promotion-behavior]
As the Predictive capability feature is in public preview, it is available for a limited promotion period. After this period ends, the following changes occur in alerts:
* Predictive alert events are no longer available in the UI.
* Alert conditions are re-registered with only the static portion of the threshold. This re-registration resets the aggregation window, potentially delaying alert detection if a condition's threshold is breached during the process.
