With multi-location Synthetic monitoring alert conditions, you can create a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time.

## Why this matters [#feature]

For [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) that runs in multiple [locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#setting-location), a single location will sometimes temporarily fail for a wide variety of reasons. In many cases, a single, short-lived failure does not indicate a problem that would require a notification.

With multi-location conditions, you can set the number of locations that must simultaneous fail in order to trigger an incident and send you a notification. For example, if your monitor is running in six locations, you might set a condition requiring four locations to fail before you receive a notification.

<Callout variant="important">
  Multi-location alerts do **not** affect alerts policies for a Synthetic monitor. For example, [muting a Multi-location alert](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications) will **not** mute a [Synthetic monitor's alerts.](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/alerts-synthetic-monitoring#alerts-existing-monitor)

        This feature has a limit of 1000 conditions per account, but some types of infrastructure alert conditions also count towards this limit. If you get a notification that you've exceeded your limit, contact your New Relic representative or [Support](https://support.newrelic.com/) for assistance.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Status between checks
      </td>

      <td>
        A failed location check will be considered failed until it performs a successful check. For example: a location may fail and then immediately become available, but we'll consider it failed until a scheduled check is reported as successful.

Here's a diagram that shows how a four-location condition will be triggered for non-simultaneous failures:

<figcaption>
  This diagram shows an example of how a four-failed-locations setting will trigger an incident for failures that occur one after the other. Note that failed location checks will be viewed as failed until they next have a successful check.

## Create condition from Alerts UI [#create]

Before creating a condition, read the [rules for multi-location conditions](#rules).

<img
  title="Create a classic alert for synthetics"
  alt="A screenshot that shows what to select to create a classic alert for synthetics"
  src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_synthetics-Alerts.webp"
/>

1. From <DNT>**one.newrelic.com**</DNT>, select [<DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai), then [<DNT>**Alert policies**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/condition-builder/policy-list).

2. Click on the policy in which you'd like to create the classic alert condition or create a new policy.

3. Select <DNT>**New alert condition**</DNT>.

4. Select <DNT>**Build a classic alert**</DNT>.

5. Select <DNT>**Synthetics**</DNT> and <DNT>**Multiple location failures**</DNT>.

6. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT> to select monitors to target.

7. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>. Fill out the fields on the <DNT>**Set thresholds**</DNT> step.

8. Click <DNT>**Save condition**</DNT>.

## Create condition with the API [#api]

Before creating a condition, read the [rules for multi-location conditions](#rules).

For example, multi-location condition REST API calls see the [REST API calls for alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/rest-api-alerts/rest-api-calls-alerts/#multilocation-synthetics-conditions) documentation.

To use the alerts REST API to manage multi-location conditions, use the [REST API explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/alerts_location_failure_conditions/create).
