With <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> you can easily tell whether an entity (the target for the notification) has one or more conditions associated with it:

* If <DNT>**yes**</DNT>, its health status indicator on the selected index (APM, browser, etc.) will be color-coded to the current state. To view a summary of current alert incidents, mouse over its health status indicator.
* If <DNT>**no**</DNT>, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey.

<Callout variant="important">
  To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see [alerting concepts and terms](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/#concepts-terms).
</Callout>

## Exceptions

The health status indicator doesn't apply for:

* [Dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards)
* Entities that have their [alertable attribute](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions/blob/093b7151d33afa68d098bf5b10f02490b8ee03ff/docs/entities/lifecycle.md#alertable) set to false in the entity definition

## Color-coded health status [#colors]

Entities in New Relic are automatically color-coded with their health status. For example, to view the health of your <InlinePopover type="apm"/> apps, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**APM**</DNT>. The <DNT>**Applications**</DNT> index lists all <InlinePopover type="apm"/> product entities and their current health status.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={250}>
        <DNT>
          **Color**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **Health status**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-green.webp"/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert incidents are currently reported for it.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-yellow.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-yellow.webp"/> Yellow
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is degraded. A [warning threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been breached.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-red.webp"/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        A [critical threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been breached:

        * [Notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) have been sent based on the selected [incident rollup preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
        * The incident appears in the [<DNT>**Incidents**</DNT> index](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src="/images/accounts_logo_alerts-gray.webp"/> Gray
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are not set up for the entity, the reporting system is down, or the entity's alert conditions are not consistently reporting a signal for the entity.

## Health status transitions [#health-status-tranistions]

The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        <DNT>
          **From...**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th width={150}>
        <DNT>
          **To...**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **Transition explanation**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src="/images/accounts_logo_alerts-gray.webp"/> Gray

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-green.webp"/> Green
      </td>

      <td>
        The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no incidents present.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-green.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-green.webp"/> Green /

        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src="/images/accounts_icon_alerts-red.webp"/> Red
      </td>

      <td>
        <img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-gray.png" src="/images/accounts_logo_alerts-gray.webp"/> Gray
      </td>

      <td>
        Possible explanations:

        * The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report.
        * The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report.
        * The entity has stopped reporting data.
        * The entity is only being targeted by conditions that evaluate entities as part of an aggregation, not individually.
        * The entity's conditions are currently not generating a consistent signal.
        * There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the [New Relic status page](https://status.newrelic.com/) for updates.

## Example: App without conditions [#example-v3-no-policies]

Here's an example of an app listed on the <InlinePopover type="apm"/> index that <DNT>**is not**</DNT> associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates that there are currently no conditions targeting the entity or the entity's conditions are not currently generating a consistent signal.

<img
  title="032715crop-events-no-v3.png"
  alt="032715crop-events-no-v3.png"
  src="/images/accounts_icon_event-alerts-.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Explorer**</DNT>: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions.
</figcaption>

Follow [standard procedures](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions) to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it.

## Example: App with conditions [#example-v3-yes-policies]

Here's an example of an app listed on the <InlinePopover type="apm"/> index that <DNT>**is**</DNT> associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) incidents.

<img
  title="032715crop-events-green.png"
  alt="032715crop-events-green.png"

/>

<figcaption>
  Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Explorer**</DNT>: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't breached any threshold.
