This document explains the different ways alert events can be closed.

## How alert events automatically close [#close-automatic]

An alert event will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-breaching state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the [recovery period](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#recovery-period).

For example: If the breaching behavior is "Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes," then the alert event will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a "for at least x minutes" threshold: x minutes of non-breaching behavior are required to automatically close the alert event.

When an alert event closes automatically:

1. The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period.
2. The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous alert event ended.

All conditions have an [alert event time limit](#time-limit) setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting alert event.

## Set a time limit for long-lasting alert events [#time-limit]

The alert event time limit setting will automatically force-close a long-lasting alert event after the number of days/hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual alert event that won't automatically close.

<DNT>
  **Limits and Defaults**
</DNT>

* All alert events will have an alert event time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field.
* The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 3 days (24 hours for infrastructure conditions).
* The alert event time limit for non-Infrastructure conditions can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still breaching in 30 days, the alert event will close, and a new alert event will open. Infrastructure conditions can be set to the following hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This setting is related to the [inactive issue setting](/docs/alerts/admin/user-settings/#auto-close-issue-window).

  When the time periods in these two settings are different, our system uses the shorter time period, regardless of the setting. For example, if the close open alert event time setting is 2 days and the inactive issue time setting is 3 days, our system would wait 2 days before closing the issue.
</Callout>

<DNT>
  **Examples:**
</DNT>

* You set the alert event time limit to 12 hours. If that alert event lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset.
* Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates an alert event. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set an alert event time limit, the crashed JVM’s alert event will never close.
