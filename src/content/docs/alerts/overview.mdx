New Relic <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> is a flexible system that allows you to get informed about issues for any entity or stream of telemetry data. You define the data to watch, the thresholds that if exceeded mean an issue, who is notified, and how. Alerts empower your team with dynamic tools to proactively detect and address potential problems. By pinpointing unusual activity, linking related issues, and aiding in root cause analysis, alerts enable swift action to keep your systems running smoothly.

New Relic's alerts help you to know what's critical, manage the suppressed noise, and mitigate alert fatigue.

With alerts, you can:

* Configure any signal to be evaluated against a [threshold](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-threshold), or if it exhibits abnormal behavior.
* Organize alerts through [tagging](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#query-tags).
* Identify [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/) before they become broader issues.
* Route issues to the correct system or team using [notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications/).
* Enable the <DNT>[Predictive capability](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/predictive-alerts)</DNT> to anticipate and respond proactively to possible threshold breaches in the future. (Available with the public preview of Predictive Alerts).

New Relic alerts allow you to:

* [Enrich](/docs/alerts/get-notified/alert-event-workflows/#enrichments) your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.
* Normalize your data, group related alert events, and establish relationships between them.
* [Correlate](/docs/alerts/organize-alerts/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#what-is-correlaton) incoming alert events.
* Provide a [root cause analysis](/docs/alerts/alert-event-management/Issues-and-alert-event-management-and-response/#root-cause-analysis).
* Reduce and [suppress noisy alerts](/docs/alerts/organize-alerts/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#configure-correlation).

There are some steps you need to take in order to set up an alert condition and receive notifications. Check out our [tutorial series](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-new-relic-alerts/) for all steps you need to get started.

## Alerting concepts and terms [#concepts-terms]

An alert event is generated when an active alert condition's threshold has been met. You can correlate similar or related alert events to an issue and group alert conditions together to create an alert policy.

You can configure notifications through Workflows to inform you about the triggering of alert conditions. These notifications include the option of sending them to various channels to reach the right group of people and help them triage the issue.

To get the most of alerting, it's essential to understand some basic terms and concepts.

This diagram shows how alerts work: you create an alert policy that includes an alert condition or several alert conditions. Alert conditions include a defined threshold and when that threshold is breached, an alert event triggers. If you've configured a workflow, then you'll receive a notification. You can group alert events into issues and issues into decisions to have better management of your alerts.
