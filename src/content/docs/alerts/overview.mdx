New Relic <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> is a flexible system that allows you to get informed about issues for any entity or stream of telemetry data. You define the data to watch, the thresholds that if exceeded mean an issue, who is notified, and how. Alerts empower your team with dynamic tools to proactively detect and address potential problems. By pinpointing unusual activity, linking related issues, and aiding in root cause analysis, alerts enable swift action to keep your systems running smoothly.

New Relic's alerts help you to know what's critical, manage the suppressed noise, and mitigate alert fatigue.

With alerts, you can:

* Configure any signal to be evaluated against a [threshold](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-threshold), or if it exhibits abnormal behavior.
* Organize alerts through [tagging](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#query-tags).
* Identify [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/) before they become broader issues.
* Route issues to the correct system or team using [notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications/).

New Relic alerts allows you to:

* [Enrich](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#enrichments) your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.
* Normalize your data, group related incidents, and establish relationships between them.
* [Correlate](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#what-is-correlaton) incoming incidents.
* Provide a [root cause analysis](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#root-cause-analysis).
* Reduce and [suppress noisy alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#configure-correlation).

There are some steps you need to take in order to set up an alert condition and receive notifications. Check out our [tutorial series](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-new-relic-alerts/) for all steps you need to get started.

## Alerting concepts and terms [#concepts-terms]

An incident is generated when an active alert condition's threshold has been met. You can correlate similar or related incidents to an issue and group alert conditions together to create an alert policy.

You can configure notifications through Workflows to inform you about the triggering of alert conditions. These notifications include the option of sending them to various channels to reach the right group of people and help them triage the issue.

To get the most of alerting, it's essential to understand some basic terms and concepts.

This diagram shows how alerts work: you create an alert policy that includes an alert condition or several alert conditions. Alert conditions include a defined threshold and when that threshold is breached, an incident triggers. If you've configured a workflow, then you'll receive a notification. You can group incidents into issues and issues into decisions to have better management of your alerts.

## Note about EU/US data centers [#eu-datacenter]

New Relic's alerts service is performed in the United States. By using New Relic alerts, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/).
