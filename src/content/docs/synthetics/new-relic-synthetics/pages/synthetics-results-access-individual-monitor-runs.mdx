Use the **Results** page to view individual monitor results. Locate interesting results by [sorting the list](#sort-list) to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or [filter by location](#filter-location) to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. The **Page Load Time** graph gives a snapshot of how page performance has varied over time.

## View the Results page [#viewing]

To access your monitor's **Results**: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)** > (select a monitor) > **Results**.

## Use page functions [#using]

The **Results** page supports the following features:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="sort-list">
      <td>
        Sort the results list
      </td>

      <td>
        From the **Sort By** dropdown, select an option:

        * To view your fastest and slowest results, sort by **Duration** (select descending to view your slowest, or ascending to view the fastest).
        * Find unusually large or small response packets by sorting by **Response Size** (select descending or ascending, as appropriate).
        * Sort your results by timestamp by selecting **Newest** or **Oldest**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="filter-location">
      <td>
        Filter by location
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a location label to hide results from that location. Select the location label again to unhide those results. To view results from only one location, hide every other location.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="hide-unhide">
      <td>
        Hide and unhide chart elements
      </td>

      <td>
        Select chart elements to hide and unhide them from the **Page Load Time** chart.
