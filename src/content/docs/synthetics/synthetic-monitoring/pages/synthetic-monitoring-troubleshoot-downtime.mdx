Use the **Failures** page to locate and troubleshoot downtime incidents or other errors. A downtime incident occurs whenever a monitor fails to completely execute. For example, a ping monitor is "down" when the GET request fails, while a scripted browser monitor is "down" if any part of the script fails to execute. After locating an interesting downtime, select it to [view detailed results from that downtime incident](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#understanding) and troubleshoot.

## View the failures page [#viewing]

To access your monitor's failures: Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Failures**.

<figcaption>
  Hover the mouse over a failure to get quick data about it. Click on the dot to open a detailed report of the failure. You can also click **Run check** to [recheck the failed monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/recheck-failed-monitors).
</figcaption>

## View individual downtimes [#individual]

You can select individual downtime incidents to view them in more detail. Depending on the specific failure, a downtime result could include only the server error message (such as **Server replied with "HTTP 500" error**), or a full or partial [waterfall view](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#understanding).

Downtime results include waterfalls when only part of a monitor executed correctly. For example, a [301 redirect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301) could link to a failing web page. The browser correctly executes the redirect, but the destination web page returns an error. Use the error message or waterfall to troubleshoot the downtime incident.

## Use page functions [#using]

The **Failures** page supports the following features:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="sort-list">
      <td>
        Sort the list of downtimes
      </td>

      <td>
        In the table header, select **Time** or **Message** to sort the list. Select **Time** or **Message** again to change from ascending sort to descending sort order.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="filter-location">
      <td>
        Filter by location
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a location label to hide downtime incidents from that location. Select the location label again to unhide those results. To view results from only one location, hide every other location.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="quickly-switch">
      <td>
        Quickly access another monitor
      </td>

      <td>
        1. At the top of the screen, click on the name of the current monitor to open the dropdown menu.
        2. Select from the list of recent monitors, or enter a name in the search field to search for a specific monitor.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="time-frame">
      <td>
        Change the time frame
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the [time picker](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data) to adjust the number of downtime incidents returned.
      </td>
