In our synthetic monitoring tool, the monitors index lists all monitors associated with your New Relic account, and gives you a quick snapshot of each monitor's performance over the last 24 hours. Select an individual monitor to view a [**Summary** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/dashboards/synthetics-overview-dashboard-view-monitors-performance) and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. Or, [filter the list](#search-monitors) to quickly compare the performance of similar monitors.

## View the monitors index [#viewing]

To access an index (or list) of your monitors, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > Synthetic monitors**. Use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) to access all your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from synthetic monitors to applications, hosts, or custom groupings of any elements. 

Alternatively, you can go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics**.

You can also use the [explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) to view a list of all monitors associated with your New Relic account, along with a quick snapshot of each monitor's performance. To access an index (or list) of your monitors: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > Synthetic monitors**.

## Understand monitor metrics [#understanding]

Use the monitors index to access your monitors and view a quick snapshot of monitor performance. The index includes the following metrics:

* [**Alert status**](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies): Indicates the status of any alerts on the monitor:
  * Green: No open violations
  * Red: Critical violation in progress
  * Grey: No alert conditions defined with New Relic Alerts
* **Monitor status**: Indicates a status has been applied to the monitor, such as **Mute** or **Disabled**.
* **Success rate**: The percentage of monitor checks that end in success. A multi-step monitor that does not complete all steps is considered a failure.
* **[Locations failing](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-location)**: The number of locations that have failed during the given timeframe.
* **[Period](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-frequency)**: How often the monitor checks run.
* **[Monitor type](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#setting-type)**: The selected monitor type.

## Use index functions [#using]

The monitors index supports the following features:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="sort-monitors">
      <td>
        Sort the monitor list
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a column label to sort the list based on that [metric](#understanding). Select the label again to change the sort order from ascending to descending.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="search-monitors">
      <td>
        Filter the monitor list
      </td>

      <td>
        Type your keyword in the search box to filter by name, [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor), or [entitiy](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) type.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="create-monitors">
      <td>
        Add to favorites
      </td>

      <td>
        To favorite a monitor, select the **star _star_ icon** icon. Favorite monitors appear at the top of the monitor list. To remove a monitor from your favorites, select the **star** icon again.
      </td>
    </tr>
