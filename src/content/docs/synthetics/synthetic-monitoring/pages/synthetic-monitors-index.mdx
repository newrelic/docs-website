In our synthetic monitoring tool, the monitors index lists your synthetic monitors, and gives you a snapshot of each monitor's performance over the last 24 hours. Select a specific monitor to view a [<DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/dashboards/synthetics-overview-dashboard-view-monitors-performance) and get deeper insights about its performance. Or, [filter the list](#search-monitors) to quickly compare the performance of similar monitors.

## View the monitors index [#viewing]

To see a list of your synthetic monitors, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**</DNT>.

## Understand monitor metrics [#understanding]

Use the monitors index to access your monitors and view a snapshot of monitor performance. The index includes the following metrics:

* [<DNT>**Alert status**</DNT>](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies): Indicates the status of any alerts on the monitor:
  * Green: No open alert events
  * Red: Critical alert event in progress
  * Grey: No alert conditions defined with alerts
* <DNT>**Monitor status**</DNT>: Indicates a status has been applied to the monitor, such as <DNT>**Mute**</DNT> or <DNT>**Disabled**</DNT>.
* <DNT>**Success rate**</DNT>: The percentage of monitor checks that end in success. A multi-step monitor that does not complete all steps is considered a failure.
* <DNT>**[Locations failing](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-location)**</DNT>: The number of locations that have failed during the given timeframe.
* <DNT>**[Period](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-frequency)**</DNT>: How often the monitor checks run.
* <DNT>**[Monitor type](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#setting-type)**</DNT>: The selected monitor type.

## Use index functions [#using]

The monitors index supports the following features:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        <DNT>
          **If you want to...**
        </DNT>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DNT>
          **Do this...**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="sort-monitors">
      <td>
        Sort the monitor list
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a column label to sort the list based on that [metric](#understanding). Select the label again to change the sort order from ascending to descending.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="search-monitors">
      <td>
        Filter the monitor list
      </td>

      <td>
        Type your keyword in the search box to filter by name, [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor), or [entitiy](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) type.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="create-monitors">
      <td>
        Add to favorites
      </td>

      <td>
        To favorite a monitor, select the <DNT>**star _star_ icon**</DNT> icon. Favorite monitors appear at the top of the monitor list. To remove a monitor from your favorites, select the <DNT>**star**</DNT> icon again.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
