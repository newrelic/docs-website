The **Summary** page of synthetic monitoring gives you an at-a-glance understanding of your website's performance. You can look for trends in request/response times, connection times, and errors. Use the filter to narrow data to attributes or values of interest, or [recheck failed monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/recheck-failed-monitors).

## View the Summary page [#viewing]

To access your monitor's **Summary** page: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)** > (select a monitor).

  The **Summary** page gives you a high-level view of your website's performance, and has shortcuts to location checks, alert violations, and your monitor's metadata.

## Use page functions [#using]

The **Summary** page supports the following functions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="view-result">
      <td>
        View a result in detail
      </td>

      <td>
        To view exact metrics, hover the mouse over the chart.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="hide-location">
      <td>
        Re-run a monitor check
      </td>

      <td>
        Click the **Run check button** to recheck any failed monitor.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="view-alert">
      <td>
        View detailed about an alert violation
      </td>

      <td>
        In the [Activity panel](#activity-panel), click on the displayed alert to go directly to the [alert incident](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) page.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="quickly-switch">
      <td>
        Quickly access another monitor
      </td>

      <td>
        1. At the top of the screen, click on the name of the current monitor to open the dropdown menu.
        2. Select from the list of recent monitors, or enter a name in the search field to search for a specific monitor.

        Change the time frame
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the [time picker](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data) to adjust the number of results returned for the following charts:

        * Request/response times
        * Connection times
        * Non-200 response codes

## Legacy charts [#more_help]

<Callout variant="important">
  The following table applies to the old view of the synthetic monitoring summary page. Click **Show new view** to access a new curated summary experience.
</Callout>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Synthetic chart
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td id="load-time">
        Load time chart
      </td>

      <td>
        This shows the load times for each monitor [location](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-location). When you [select a short time frame](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/ui-functions/time-picker-setting-time-periods-view-data) (such as 30 minutes), synthetic monitoring displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, synthetic monitors adjusts the resolution to show averages.

        To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="availability">
        Availability
      </td>

      <td>
        This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success.

        Above the selected monitor's **Availability** chart, an ellipsis <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
        icon appears. Use New Relic's [comparative charting feature](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/compare-page-load-performance-browser-synthetics) for a direct page load time comparison between real user ([browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser)) interactions and the synthetic monitors.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td id="average-load-size">
        Average load size
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages.

        If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td id="slowest-results">
        Slowest results
      </td>

      <td>
        This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To [view the performance breakdown](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#understanding), select a result.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
