Your organization's [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included for free per month. 

A synthetic monitoring check is an individual execution of a synthetic monitor. When a monitor runs from one location, it counts as one check, so you can also think of synthetics check as a synthetics job, or a job execution. 

For example, if a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, then that comes out to `24 * 5` checks per day, totaling 120 checks. Your organization's pricing edition determines your check limits and you can view and facet the number of checks that have been executed. 

## Included check counts per edition [#edition-limits]

Your organization's [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

The following are the checks included for free with each pricing edition: 

* Free tier: 500 per month
* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

## Exceeding free amount [#exceeding-free]

For information on the cost of exceeding the free number of monitor checks, see the [list price table](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions#list-price).

## Usage timestamps [#usage-timestamps]

Usage timestamps utilize the time that a synthetic check result is received and processed. This may introduce a slight difference in usage data compared to the time the synthetic check was executed.
