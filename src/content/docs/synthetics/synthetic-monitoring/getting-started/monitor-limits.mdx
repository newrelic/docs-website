Your organization's [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included for free per month.

A synthetic monitoring check is an individual execution of a synthetic monitor. When a monitor runs from one location, it counts as one check, so you can also think of synthetics check as a synthetics job, or a job execution.

For example, if a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, then that comes out to `24 * 5` checks per day, totaling 120 checks. Your organization's pricing edition determines your check limits and you can view and facet the number of checks that have been executed.

## Included check counts per edition [#edition-limits]

Your [pricing edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included for free per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor.

The following are the synthetic checks included for free on each pricing edition:

* Free: 500 per month
* Standard: 10K per month
* Pro: 1M per month
* Enterprise: 10M per month

## Exceeding free amount [#exceeding-free]

For information on the cost of exceeding the free number of monitor checks, see the [list price table](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-usage-plan/#list-price). Scroll down to view add-on pricing, which includes synthetic checks.

## Usage timestamps [#usage-timestamps]

Our [usage-related data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts) has timestamps that use the time a synthetic check result is received and processed. This may cause a slight difference between the time a synthetic check was executed and that time in our usage data.
