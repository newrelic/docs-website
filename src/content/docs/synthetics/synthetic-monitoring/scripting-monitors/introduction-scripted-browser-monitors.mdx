Scripted browsers emulate a custom user experience by scripting browsers that navigate your website, take specific actions, and ensure specific elements are present. To create a scripted browser, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Create a monitor](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/monitor-create)**, then select the **User flow / functionality** tile. 

For a list of all available functions, see [Scripted browser reference](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetic-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-chrome-100/).

Scripted monitors are driven by [Selenium WebDriverJS](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html). Each time your script runs, New Relic creates a fully virtualized Selenium-driven Google Chrome browser that navigates your website and follows each step of the script. Synthetic monitoring includes an IDE-style script editor what suggests functions, locators, and other elements to simplify scripting.

For a look at how to use the Selenium IDE to record your workflows and export them in the format required by New Relic, watch this short YouTube video (3:49 minutes).

## Visit a URL [#visiting-a-url]

All scripts begin by specifying which URL the monitor should navigate to. To specify a URL, call `$browser.get("url")`:

```
$browser.get("https://mywebsite.com");
```

## Sequence actions [#sequence]

Because WebDriverJS is asynchronous, scripting actions can sometimes execute out of order. To force script actions to execute in order, wrap each action in a `then(function(){})` call:

```
$browser.get("https://my-website.com").then(function(){
    return $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText("Configuration Panel"));
});
```

To connect multiple actions in sequence, wrap each action in a `then(function(){})` call, and chain the calls together:

```
$browser.get("https://my-website.com").then(function(){
    return $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText("Configuration Panel"));
}).then(function(){
    return $browser.findElement($driver.By.partialLinkText("Configuration Pa"));
});
```

## Locate elements [#locating-elements]

Once you have specified a URL to monitor, you will usually want to locate a particular element on the page. Locating an element verifies its presence on the page, and also allows you to [interact with page elements](#interacting-elements).

You can locate elements by their `class`, `id`, `link text`, `name` or even XPath. To find these attributes, use your browser's developer tools or view your website's source code. For a list of all locator functions, see [Locators: Find page elements](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/synthetics-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-050#locators).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="locate-by-class"
    title="Locate by CSS class"
  >
    Locate an element by its HTML `class` (for example, `class="button"`). A class is usually specified for CSS styling. When locating an element by class, the monitor will select the first element on the page that has that class:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.className("button"));
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="locate-by-id"
    title="Locate by HTML ID"
  >
    Locate an element by its **exact** HTML `id` (for example, `id="edit-submit"`). This is a straightforward way to locate page elements, but be careful to specify an `id` that is not likely to change.

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.id("edit-submit"));
    ```

    For an example of locating an element by its `id`, see [Wait for a page element](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#wait-for-element).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="locate-by-link-text"
    title="Locate by link text"
  >
    Locate an element by its displayed link text; for example, `<a href="http://example.com>your link text here</a>`. You can locate by the **exact** link text (`$driver.By.linkText`) or by partial match (`$driver.By.partialLinkText`):

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText("Configuration Panel"));
    ```

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.partialLinkText("Configuration Pa"));
    ```

    For an example of locating a link by its link text, see [Navigate to a link](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#advanced-navigate).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="locate-by-name"
    title="Locate by name"
  >
    Locate an element by its **exact** HTML `name` (for example, `name="search-query-field"`). This is most commonly used with input fields such as a search box:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.name("search-query-field"));
    ```

    For an example of locating an element by its `name`, see [Log in to a website](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#advanced-login).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="locate-by-xpath"
    title="Locate by XPath"
  >
    For more complex page structures, you can use XPath to locate the target element:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath("//input[@placeholder = 'search-query-field']"));
    ```

    XPath selectors can break when your website's structure changes. For tips on building good XPath selectors, see [Optimizing XPath selectors](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/optimize-xpath-selectors/). For an example of locating an element by its xpath, see [Search a website](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#advanced-search).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      To quickly find the XPath for a particular element, use your browser's developer tools. For example, in Chrome:

      1. In Chrome, navigate to the target website.
      2. Right-click the target element, then select **Inspect element**.
      3. From the Developer Tools panel that opens automatically, look for the highlighted target element.
      4. Right-click the target element, then select **Copy XPath**.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Interact with elements [#interacting-elements]

Because a scripted monitor drives a real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser, scripted monitors can interact with page elements in the same way a user would. For example, the monitor can click a link, enter text in a search box, etc. For a list of available actions, see [ActionSequence: Link multiple actions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/synthetics-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-050#actionsequence).

First, [locate the page element](#locating-elements), then call an interaction function:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="clicking-elements"
    title="Click page elements"
  >
    To click on a link or other page element, locate the element and call the `click()` function:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText("Configuration Panel")).click();
    ```

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.className("config-panel-02")).click();
    ```

    For an example of clicking a located element, see [Navigate to a link](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#advanced-navigate).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can control the mouse in other ways with the `doubleClick()`, `dragAndDrop()`, `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`, and `mouseMove` functions.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="entering-text"
    title="Enter text"
  >
    To enter text in a field, locate the field and call the `sendKeys()` function:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.name("search-query-field")).sendKeys("EXAMPLE USER NAME");
    ```

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.id("search-q-box")).sendKeys("EXAMPLE USER NAME");
    ```

    Some fields may have default text in them. [Clear](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/synthetics-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-050#webElement-clear) these fields before sending text to them:

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.name("search-query-field")).clear();
    ```

    ```
    $browser.findElement($driver.By.id("search-q-box")).clear();
    ```

    For an example of entering text in a field, see [Search a website](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#advanced-search).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can add modifier keys (such as `ALT` and `SHIFT`) with the `keyDown()` and `keyUp()` functions.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Waiting and timeouts [#waiting-elements]

Large page elements, such as images or complex dynamic content, can take a long time to load. This can cause your script to fail when the monitor attempts to interact with or locate an element that hasn't been loaded yet.

To avoid these issues, set wait conditions that will pause the script until the specified page element is present, or [sequence actions manually](#sequence). For a list of conditions, see [Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetics-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-050/#until).

<Callout variant="important">
  After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="wait-page-title"
    title="Wait for page title"
  >
    Instruct the monitor to wait for the page title to match a certain value. This ensures that the browser has at least received some data from the target page. To wait for page title, specify an expected title and a timeout value in milliseconds:

    ```
    //Call the wait function
    $browser.wait(function() {
    //Tell the monitor to get the page title, then run a function on that title.
      return $browser.getTitle().then(function(title) {
    //Specify the expected page title.
        return title === "Your Page Title Here";
        });
    //If the condition is not satisfied within a timeout of 1000 milliseconds (1 second), proceed anyway.
    }, 1000);
    ```

    For an example of waiting for page title, see [Wait for a page to load](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#wait-for-title).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="wait-page-element"
    title="Wait for a specific element"
  >
    Instruct the monitor to wait for a page element to be present. This is useful when an element your script depends on takes a long time to load, or simply to ensure that a page element is present before your script clicks on it.

    Use any of the [locate functions](#locating-elements) with the wait function below. Use your desired function instead of the `$driver.By.linkText` function used below:

    ```
    //Tell the monitor to wait up to 7,500 milliseconds (7.5 seconds) for a link whose text is `Your Link Text Here`.
    $browser.waitForAndFindElement($driver.By.linkText("Your Link Text Here"), 7500);
    ```

    For an example of waiting for a specific page element to load, see [Wait for a page element](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-browser-examples#wait-for-element).

    <Callout variant="important">
      `waitForAndFindElement()` will fail to find an element if it's entirely behind another element or if it has a size of 0. It will still find elements with 0 opacity.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Log script results [#logging]

You can also manually log monitor results to the [script log](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#viewing-logs). Use logging to troubleshoot a script: to discover which step of your script is failing, include a log function along with each key step in your script.

<Callout variant="important">
  The maximum log length is 50,000 bytes. Script logs larger than 50,000 bytes are truncated.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="log-static"
    title="Log static text"
  >
    To log a line of static text, call `console.log()`:

    ```
    //Send `Hello world.` to the console log.
    console.log('Hello world.');
    ```

    This results in [the output](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#viewing-logs):

    ```
    // ----------------------------------- Console log
    Hello world.
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="pass-a-variable"
    title="Pass a variable to the log function"
  >
    In addition to [logging static text](#log-static), you can also pass variables to `console.log()`:

    ```
    //Declare the variable `WEBSITE_URL`
    var assert = require('assert'),
      WEBSITE_URL = 'https://my-website.com/';

    console.log('Hello world.');
    //Load the website specified in `WEBSITE_URL`
    $browser.get(WEBSITE_URL);
    //Log our success to the console
    console.log('Success for', WEBSITE_URL);
    ```

    [Look for these results](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results#viewing-logs):

    ```
    // ----------------------------------- Console log
    Hello world.
    Success for https://my-website.com/
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Unblock analytics services [#unblock-service]

Synthetics blocks [popular analytics services'](https://nr-synthetics-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blacklists/blacklist.hosts) scripts from running by default. You can allow scripts to run for a specified service(s). This allows the service's scripts to run and collect data like it would for a real user.

```
//Allow Google Analytics scripts to run
$browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostnameArr: ['google-analytics.com']);

//Visit https://my-website.com
$browser.get('https://my-website.com');
```

## Customize the user agent [#customize-user-agent]

You can customize the scripted browser's user agent to ensure any browser-specific fixes in your app are working properly, or to bypass a security mechanism in order to filter an internal site.

```
//Simulate Internet Explorer 10.6
$browser.addHeader('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.6; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; InfoPath.2; SLCC1; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) 3gpp-gba UNTRUSTED/1.0');

//Visit http://httpbin.org/user-agent
$browser.get('http://httpbin.org/user-agent');
```

<Callout variant="important">
  This only spoofs the user-agent HTTP header for the request to the server. It does not change the value of `navigator.userAgent`.
</Callout>

## Import optional modules [#importing]

You can also import many popular Node.js modules to enhance your test suite, automate the insertion of test data, and simplify complex functions. For more information, see [Importing Node.js modules](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/importing-nodejs-modules).
