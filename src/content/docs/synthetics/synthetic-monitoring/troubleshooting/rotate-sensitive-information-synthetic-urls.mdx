## Problem

You have a synthetic monitor that contains sensitive information (like passwords or usernames) in a URL or script.

## Solution

### Replace URLs in monitors

If you use synthetic monitors that check URLs and you've placed credentials or other sensitive information in URLs, you may want to change those credentials periodically. To do so, edit your synthetic script to edit or remove the information, and ensure you rotate the credentials that were previously placed in the URL. For detailed instructions on adding and editing monitors, see [Add and edit monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/).

### Rotate plaintext credentials in scripts

When creating [scripted monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/introduction-scripted-browser-monitors/), you’re able to write your own scripts for the actions the monitor will make. 

If you've included any sensitive information in plaintext within the scripts, you should rotate your credentials: 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. Select **Settings > Script** to edit your monitor script.

    />

3. Rotate or edit any plaintext credentials. Wherever possible, replace plaintext with [secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests/).
