You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)-based private minions that accept and execute [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/types-synthetics-monitors) against your [private locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations).

The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode.

## General private minion features [#enhancements]

Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features:

* Easy to [install](#install), [start](#start), and [update](#install)
* Runs on:
  * Linux
  * [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
  * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
* Enhanced [security](#security) and support for [non-root](#run-as-non-root) user execution
* Ability to leverage a Docker container as a [sandbox](#cpm-sandboxing) environment
* Customizable monitor check timeout
* Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types

## Kubernetes-specific features [#kubernetes-enhancements]

Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment:

* Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes
* Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket
* Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters
* Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd
* Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs
* Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management
* Observability offered via the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer

## System requirements and compatibility [#system-requirements]

To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment.

## Private location key

Before launching CPMs, you must have a [private location key](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations#create-location). Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location.

To find the key for existing private location:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**.
2. In the **Private locations** index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to.
3. Note the key associated with the private location with the key <Icon name="fe-key"/>
   icon.

## Sandboxing and Docker dependencies [#sandboxing-and-docker-deps]

Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="docker-dependencies"
    title={<><img src={dockimport} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Docker dependencies</>}
  >
    The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner.

    The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the [synthetic monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors) running on the private location the minion container is associated with.

    There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that:

    * Your writable and executable directory is mounted at `/tmp`. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own `/tmp` to make things easy.
    * Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at `/var/run/docker.sock` or `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration#environment-variables). For more information, see Docker's [Daemon socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option).

      <Callout variant="caution">
        Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend **not running multiple CPMs on the same host** to avoid resource contention.
      </Callout>

      For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see [Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root](#run-non-root).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Install and update CPM versions [#install]

Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the [Quay.io](https://quay.io) repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to [quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion](https://quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion?tab=tags) for a list of all the releases.

CPM images are also hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Go to [hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags) for a list of all the releases.

Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either `quay.io` or `docker.io` will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The "runner" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See [Docker environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration/#docker-env-config) and [Kubernetes environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration/#kubernetes-env-config) for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint.

## Start the CPM [#start]

To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions.

    title={<><img src={dockimport} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/> Docker start procedure</>}
  >
    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Ensure you've enabled [Docker dependencies](#sandboxing-and-docker-deps) for sandboxing and [installed](#install-update) CPM on your system.
    3. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for `/tmp` and `/var/run/docker.sock` in the following examples to match your system.

       * Linux/macOS:

         ```
         docker run \
             --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \
             -e "MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY" \
             -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \
             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
             -d \
             --restart unless-stopped \
             quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest
         ```
       * Windows:

         ```
         docker run ^
             --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^
             -e "MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY" ^
             -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^
             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^
             -d ^
             --restart unless-stopped ^
             quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest
         ```

       View the logs for your minion container:

       ```
       docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
       ```

       When a message similar to `Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL` appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location.

    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster:

       ```
       kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```
    3. Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo.

       * If you are copying the charts for the first time:

         ```
         helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
         ```
       * If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest:

         ```
         helm repo update

    4. Install the CPM with the following Helm command:

       * For a fresh installation of the CPM:

         ```
         helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
       * To update an existing CPM installation:

         helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
    5. Check if the minion pod is up and running:

       ```
       kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods
       ```

       Once the `status` attribute of each pod is shown as `running`, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location.

## Stop or delete the CPM [#stop]

On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker `stop` procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes `delete` procedure to stop the CPM from running.

    You can [stop a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/) either by the container name, or the container ID.

    * Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows:

      ```
      docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
        docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
      ```
    * Container ID stop for Linux/macOS:

      In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit `docker rm $CONTAINER_ID`.

      ```
      CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME)
        docker stop $CONTAINER_ID
        docker rm $CONTAINER_ID
      ```
    * Container ID stop for Windows:

      In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit `docker rm $CONTAINER_ID`.

    1. Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete:

       ```
       helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```
    2. Delete the minion pod:

       ```
       helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME
       ```
    3. Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster:

       ```
       kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```

## Show help and examples [#help]

Use these options as applicable:

* To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the `show help` command.

* To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command:

  ```
  docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help
  ```

* To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see [Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-maintenance-monitoring).

* For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm `show` commands can be used to view the `chart.yaml` and the `values.yaml`, respectively:

  ```
  helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion
  ```

  ```
  helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion
  ```

## Show license information [#licensing]

To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the `LICENSE` command.

Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher:

```
docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE
```

Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the [our licenses documentation](/docs/licenses/new-relic-products/new-relic-synthetics/new-relic-synthetics-licenses).

## Configure CPM [#configuration]

You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see [CPM configuration](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration).

## Networks

For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/).

A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like `--network` and `--dns` passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers.

When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).

Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon.

If this happens, you may see `INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31` entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run `docker network prune`.

## Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root [#security]

By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with `root` user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed.

In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the [environment variable](#environment-variables) `MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR` (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or `MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR` (CPM version up to v3.0.2).

To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="run-non-root"
    title={<><img src={dockimport} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Run as non-root user for Docker</>}
  >
    For more information, see Docker's official documentation about [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/) and [AppArmor security profiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/).

    If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is `my_user`.

    1. Ensure that `my_user` can use the Docker engine on the host:

       Verify that `my_user` [belongs to the `"docker"` system group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). Scoped root access to the `docker.sock` is still needed to create bridge networks.

       OR

       Enable the [Docker TCP socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#examples), and pass the `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](#environemnt-variables) to CPM.
    2. Verify that `my_user` has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the `chmod` command.
    3. Get the `uid` of `my_user` for use in the run command: `id -u my_user`.

       Once these conditions are met, use the option `"-u <uid>:<gid>"` when launching CPM:

       ```
       docker run ... -u 1002 ...
       ```

       OR

       ```
       docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ...
       ```

## Docker image repository

A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the [quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository](https://quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion?tab=tags).

        CPMs without Internet access
      </td>

      <td>
        A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the [environment variables](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration#environment-variables) named `MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED` for a Docker container system environment or `synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled` for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the `"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net"` domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions.

      <td>
        This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of "inheritance" or a "hierarchy" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/) level.
