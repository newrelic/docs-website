In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of synthetics job managers or private minions (legacy). Synthetics job managers and minions (legacy) are containerized application that receive and manage jobs set up through the synthetics UI.

A private location can contain any number of synthetics job managers or private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site).

## What you need [#requirements]

To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Compatibility for...
      </th>

      <th>
        Requirements
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="compatibility-check-budget">
      <td>
        Check budget
      </td>

      <td>
        Checks from a private location count against [your budget](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Synthetics horde endpoint
      </td>

      <td>
        For US-based accounts: `https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/`

        For [EU-based](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center#partner-hierarchy) accounts: `https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="compatibility-outbound-network">
      <td>
        Outbound network access
      </td>

      <td>
        The synthetics job manager or minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must [configure proxy access](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-manage-private-minions#proxy).

        Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command:

        ```sh
        curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="account-access">
      <td>
        Account access and permissions
      </td>

      <td>
        If a private location is set up by an account with [child accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure), it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account.

## Create a private location [#create-location]

Before [installing synthetics job managers](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) or [installing private minions (legacy)](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms), you need to create a private location.

To create a new private location:

<img
  title="Click the Create private location button"
  alt="screenshot-manage-private-locations.png"
  src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-full_find-private-location-button.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**</DNT>: Use the <DNT>**Private Locations**</DNT> page to create, edit, and delete private locations.
</figcaption>

1. Ensure you meet the [requirements](#requirements), including [account access requirements](#account-access).

2. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**</DNT>. Then select <Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   <DNT>**Create private location**</DNT>.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     The private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor.
   </Callout>

3. Type a location name.

4. Optional: Configure these additional settings:

   * <DNT>**Description**</DNT>: Describe your private location for other account users.
   * <DNT>**Share this location:**</DNT> Select this option to share the location with other accounts in your organization.
      
        <Callout variant="tip">
          Sharing this location makes it visible to all accounts in your organization, allowing them to use it for running their synthetic monitors.
        </Callout>

   * <DNT>**[Verified script execution](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/verified-script-execution-private-locations)**</DNT>: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location.

5. Select <DNT>**Create**</DNT>.

After creating the location, synthetic monitoring lists your <DNT>**Private location key**</DNT> in the <DNT>My location</DNT> tab so you can [install a private minion](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms#install-update).

<img
  title="Add private location to a synthetic monitor"
  alt="screenshot-manage-private-locations.png"
  src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-full_private-location-page.webp"
/>

## Ping monitor checks [#checks]

Each synthetics job manager or minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, [add additional minions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms#install-update). The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on:

* Your network performance
* The complexity of your scripts
* The hardware configuration for the private minion

## Add jobs to the location queue [#add-jobs]

To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to [add or edit a monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#adding-monitors), and select your location from the <DNT>**Private locations**</DNT> list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that [monitor's settings](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#editing-monitors).

## Manage private locations [#manage-location]

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you can't access this feature, check the [Factors affecting access to features and data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
</Callout>

Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual synthetics job managers or minions (legacy). You can also [install new synthetics job managers](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) or [minions (legacy)](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms#install-update), and clear the job queue if it backs up.

To access these tools, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**</DNT>. Then follow the steps:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="clear-job-queue"
    title="Clear the job queue"
  >
    Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon, and select <DNT>**Clear queue**</DNT>.

    This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="change-location"
    title="Change location"
  >
    Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon, and select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="view-status"
    title="View status"
  >
    To view the status of an individual synthetics job manager or minion, select the parent location's name from the list.

    The green [health status indicator](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) identifies active synthetics job managers or minions.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="view-key"
    title="View private location key"

    Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon, and select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="unshare-location"
    title="Unshare a private location"
  >
  If a location is shared and used by other accounts in your organization to run synthetic monitors, you cannot unshare the private location until you remove the private location from the monitors.

    To unshare a private location, follow these steps:
    1. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon, and select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.
    2. Uncheck the <DNT>**Share this location**</DNT> box.
    3. Click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="delete-location"
    title="Delete a location"
  >
    Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon for the location, and select <DNT>**Delete**</DNT>.

    This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="enable-disable-vse"
    title="Enable or disable verified script execution"
  >
    To enable or disable [verified script execution](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/verified-script-execution-private-locations/):

    * Synthetics job managers: Verified script execution is not supported yet
    * CPM: You need to pass the [MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration#environment-variables) variable to the minion. Then, at the <DNT>**Private locations**</DNT> tab, click on <DNT>**Edit**</DNT> and, in the menu, enable the <DNT>**Verified script execution**</DNT> option.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

    Private locations use a private location key. This token allows the private location job manager (or private minion) to pull jobs to be run and report the result back to New Relic platform.

    If these keys are compromised they can't be rotated, so if they're compromised you should disable that key and deploy a new private location:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Create a new private location:

        1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics/private-location-list)**</DNT>. Then click <DNT>**Create private location**</DNT>.
        2. Enter the private location name. 
        3. (Optional) Provide a description, check the <DNT>**Share this location**</DNT> box, and check <DNT>**Enable verified script execution**</DNT>. 
        4. Click <DNT>**Generate key**</DNT> to create the new private location.

           <img
             title="Screenshot of the screen for generating private locations"
             alt="Screenshot of the screen for generating private locations"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop_generate-private-location-key.webp"
           />

        5. Update your job managers or private minions with the new private location. The <DNT>**Configure and deploy**</DNT> section includes sample code:

           <img
             title="Screenshot of the configure/deploy instructions for private locations"
             alt="Screenshot of the configure/deploy instructions for private locations"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop_configure-deploy-private-locations.webp"
           />
      </Step>

      <Step>
        Migrate monitors to the new private location. Follow these steps for each monitor you want to migrate:

        1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics)**</DNT>. Click the ellipsis icon <DNT>**...**</DNT> to the right of your monitor and select <DNT>**Monitor settings**</DNT>.

           <img
             title="How to find and edit monitor settings in synthetic"
             alt="How to find and edit monitor settings in synthetic"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop-monitor-settings.webp"
           />

        2. In the <DNT>**Select locations**</DNT> tab, disable the old location and enable the new location. Then save the monitor.

           <img
             title="Screenshot demonstrating how to swap private locations when rotating private location   keys"
             alt="Screenshot demonstrating how to swap private locations when rotating private location keys"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop_edit-monitor-settings-rotate-private-location.webp"
           />
      </Step>

      <Step>
        Once you've migrated all the monitors running on the old location, delete the old location:

        1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics/private-location-list)**</DNT>.

        2. Find the old location. You can filter by location name or ID in the filter box.

        3. Click the ellipsis icon <DNT>**...**</DNT> to the right, then select <DNT>**Edit**</DNT>.

           <img
             title="Screenshot of how to edit the key for a private location when rotating keys"
             alt="Screenshot of how to edit the key for a private location when rotating keys"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop_edit-private-location-rotate.webp"
           />

        4. Click the trash icon and confirm to delete the private location.

           <img
             title="Screenshot of delete confirmation key for private location"
             alt="Screenshot of delete confirmation key for private location"
             src="/images/synthetic_screenshot-crop_delete-private-location.webp"
           />
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    If you used secure credentials in any of the monitors you migrated, you should also [rotate those credentials](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests/#rotate-secure-credentials).
