To prevent others from using your private minions to assign [scripted browsers](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers) or [API tests](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-api-tests), add verified script execution. Then, any changes to your minions will require a passphrase that is known only to you.

The private locations list in New Relic's UI includes a **VSE** column. A lock <Icon name="fe-lock"/>
icon indicates that verified script execution has been set up for that location.

## Passphrase security [#pass-phrase-security]

Be sure to safeguard your private minion's passphrase. No other users on your account can view it, and it is never stored in New Relic's collector.

This restriction includes New Relic support personnel. Because our collector never stores your passphrase, our support team cannot recover or reset your passphrase for you. If you forget your passphrase, you will need to change it in the [minion **Overview** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions#configure), and then update each monitor assigned to that private location.

## Enable verified script execution [#cpm]

To enable verified script execution for containerized private minions, do the following. Be sure to record your passphrase in a secure place.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location)**. Select the private location's ellipses icon, and click **Edit**. Enable verified script execution, then save.
2. Set the passphrase in your Docker or Kubernetes environment:

   * **Docker:** Add the `MINION_VSE_PASSWORD` environment variable to the Docker `run` command used to start your private minion:

     ```
     docker run \
       --name <var>YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME</var> \
       -e "MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var>" \
       -e "MINION_VSE_PASSWORD=<var>YOUR_PASSPHRASE</var>"
       -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
       -d \
       --restart unless-stopped \
       quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest
     ```
   * **Kubernetes:** Set the `synthetics.minionVsePassphrase` value in the Helm `install` or `upgrade` command:

     ```
     helm install <var>YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME</var>/synthetics-minion \
        -n <var>YOUR_NAMESPACE</var>
        --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var> \
        --set synthetics.minionVsePassphrase=<var>YOUR_PASSPHRASE</var>
     ```
3. From the Synthetics UI, select a monitor assigned to that location. Then select **Settings > General**.
4. From the list of private locations, select your location, type your passphrase, and save. Be sure to record your passphrase in a secure place.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each monitor you want to assign to your location.

## Change your passphrase [#changing-pass-phrase]

To change your passphrase, do the following. Be sure to record your passphrase in a secure place.

1. Update the passphrase in your Docker or Kubernetes environment:

   * **Docker:** Stop your current minion. Then use the Docker `run` command to start a new minion with your updated `MINION_VSE_PASSWORD` environment variable:

     ```
     docker run \
       --name <var>YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME</var> \
       -e "MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var>" \
       -e "MINION_VSE_PASSWORD=<var>YOUR_PASSPHRASE</var>"
       -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
       -d \
       --restart unless-stopped \
       quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest
     ```
   * **Kubernetes:** Use the Helm `upgrade` command to set your updated `synthetics.minionVsePassphrase` value:

     ```
     helm upgrade <var>YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME</var>/synthetics-minion \
        -n <var>YOUR_NAMESPACE</var>
        --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var> \
        --set synthetics.minionVsePassphrase=<var>YOUR_PASSPHRASE</var>
     ```
2. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > (assigned monitor) > Settings > General**.
3. From the list of private locations, select your location, type your new passphrase, and save.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each monitor assigned to your location.

## Disable verified script execution [#disabling]

To disable verified script execution for containerized private minions:

1. Remove the passphrase in your Docker or Kubernetes environment:

   * **Docker:** Stop your current minion container. Then use the Docker `run` command to start a new minion without the `MINION_VSE_PASSWORD` environment variable:

     ```
     docker run \
       --name <var>YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME</var> \
       -e "MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var>" \
       -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
       -d \
       --restart unless-stopped \
       quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest
     ```
   * **Kubernetes:** Use the Helm `upgrade` command without the `--set synthetics.minionVsePassphrase` value:

     ```
     helm upgrade <var>YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME</var>/synthetics-minion \
        -n <var>YOUR_NAMESPACE</var>
        --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=<var>YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY</var> \
     ```
2. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location)**. Clear the **Enable verified script execution** checkbox, then save.

## Other (legacy) [#enabling]

If you are not using containerized private minions, do the following to enable verified script execution. Be sure to record your passphrase in a secure place.

1. In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `https://MINION_IP_ADDRESS` (for example, `https://1.2.3.4`).
2. Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon, then select **Advanced settings (optional)**.
3. Select the **Verified script execution** checkbox. Type a passphrase, then save. Record your passphrase in a secure place.
4. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location)**. Select the private location's ellipses icon, and click **Edit**. Enable verified script execution, then save.
5. From the Synthetics UI, select a monitor assigned to that location. Then select **Settings > General**.
6. From the list of private locations, select your location, type your passphrase, and save.
7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each monitor you want to assign to your location.

To change your passphrase or disable verified script execution, follow the same basic process to go to your minion's IP address and update its **Advanced settings**. Then go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) to complete the process.
