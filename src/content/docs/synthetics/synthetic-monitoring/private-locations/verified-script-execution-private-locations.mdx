Verified script execution allows you to secure your private minions, so that no one can assign [scripted browsers](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers) or [API tests](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-api-tests) to your minions without entering a pass phrase.

## Passphrase security [#pass-phrase-security]

Your private minion's passphrase is known only to you, and it is never stored in New Relic's collector. This restriction includes other users on your account and New Relic admins.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Because New Relic never stores your passphrase, New Relic Support cannot recover or reset your passphrase for you. If you forget your passphrase, you will need to change it in the [minion **Overview** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions#configure), and then update each monitor assigned to that private location.
</Callout>

## Enable verified script execution [#enabling]

To enable verified script execution, you must enter a passphrase in the [minion **Overview** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions#configure), enable verified script execution for the associated private location, and enter the passphrase at each monitor assigned to that location:

1. In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS` (for example, `http://1.2.3.4`).
2. Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon, then select **Advanced settings (optional)**.
3. Select the **Verified script execution** checkbox. Type a passphrase and record that passphrase in a secure place. Select **Save configuration**.
4. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location)**. Select the ellipses icon and click **Edit**. Then select the **Enable verified script execution** checkbox. Save.
5. From the Synthetics UI, select a monitor assigned to that location. Then select **Settings > General**.
6. From the list of **Private locations**, select your location and type your passphrase. Select **Save changes**.
7. Repeat steps **5** and **6** for each monitor you want to assign to your location.

The **Private locations** index includes a **VSE** column. A lock <Icon name="fe-lock"/>
icon indicates that verified script execution has been set up for that location.

## Change your passphrase [#changing-pass-phrase]

To change your passphrase, enter the new pass phrase in the [minion **Overview** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions#configure). Then update the passphrase in the settings for each monitor assigned to that location.

1. In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS` (for example, `http://1.2.3.4`).
2. Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon, and then select **Advanced settings (optional)**.
3. Type a passphrase and record that passphrase in a secure place. Select **Save configuration**.
4. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > (assigned monitor) > Settings > General**.
5. From the list of **Private locations**, select your location and type your new passphrase. Select **Save changes**.
6. Repeat steps **4** and **5** for each monitor assigned to your location.

## Disable verified script execution [#disabling]

To disable verified script execution, you must disable the feature in the [minion **Overview** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions#configure), and then turn it off in your private location settings.

1. In your web browser, navigate to the minion **Overview** page at `http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS` (for example, `http://1.2.3.4`).
2. Select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon, then select **Advanced settings (optional)**.
3. Clear the **Verified script execution** checkbox, and select **Save configuration**.
4. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location)**. Clear the **Enable verified script execution** checkbox, and select **Save**.
