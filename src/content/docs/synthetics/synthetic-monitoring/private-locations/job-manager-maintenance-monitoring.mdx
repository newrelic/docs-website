After [installing your synthetics job manager](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways:

* Check if the synthetics job manager is healthy and working with the [synthetics job manager status endpoint](#sjm-status).
* See if a private location is under-provisioned and [needs more synthetics job managers](#more-jobmanagers).
* Review your [Docker logs](#monitor-docker-logs), [Podman logs](#monitor-podman-logs), [Kubernetes logs](#monitor-docker-logs) or [OpenShift logs](#review-openshift-logs).

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also get notified of monitor failures with [New Relic's alerts](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitors/using-monitors/alerts-synthetic-monitoring).
</Callout>

## Check synthetics job manager status using HTTP [#sjm-status]

Connecting to a running synthetics job manager using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes port `8080`. You can check the synthetics job manager with the following endpoints:

* `:8080/status/check`: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. `HTTP 200` means the status is healthy.

## Check if your private location requires more synthetics job managers [#more-jobmanagers]

If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more synthetics job managers available to execute the monitor checks. In Kubernetes, this could be addressed with more ping runtime replicas and higher parallelism settings for API and browser runtimes.

To learn how to verify this, see [Does my private location need more synthetics job managers?](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/monitor-private-locations/#more-minions)

## Review logs [#monitor-docker-logs]

You can monitor your minion's health by looking at synthetics job manager container logs.

## Enable debug logs [#monitor-docker-debug-logs]

If you experience issues with your synthetics job manager, you can enable debug logs to help troubleshoot issues.

The default level of logging is set to only inform the user of key information and actionable errors. If this is insufficient, you can enable a more verbose logging by using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

<Callout variant="important">
  Be careful increasing the log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`. Higher log levels will record more data—that can help you debug, but also increases the risk of capturing sensitive data and storing sensitive data outside of your approved locations. To ensure data privacy and security, you should limit the types of information New Relic collects.

## Retrieve Kubernetes debugging information [#retrieve-kubernetes-debugging]

If you experience issues with your synthetics job manager in a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, you can retrieve information about the synthetics job manager pod and the node it is running on to help troubleshoot.

To retrieve information for the synthetics job manager pod:

```shell
kubectl describe pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_POD_NAME
```

To retrieve information for the node the synthetics job manager pod is running on, identify the node, and then:

```shell
kubectl describe node NODE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_POD_NAME
```

## Retrieve OpenShift debugging information [#retrieve-openshift-debugging]

If you experience issues with your synthetics job manager in OpenShift system environment, you can retrieve information about the synthetics job manager pod and the node it is running on to help troubleshoot.

To retrieve information for the synthetics job manager pod:

```shell
oc describe pod -n <your-namespace> Your_JOB_MANAGER_NAME
```

## Monitor synthetics job managers with New Relic Infrastructure [#monitor-via-infrastructure]

[New Relic's infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure) supports [advanced Docker monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure) and [advanced Kubernetes monitoring](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration).

If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the `docker inspect` of the container before it is deleted.
