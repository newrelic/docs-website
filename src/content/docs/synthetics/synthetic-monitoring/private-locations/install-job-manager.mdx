metaDescription: Install New Relic's container based job manager that accepts and runs jobs assigned to your private locations
freshnessValidatedDate: never
---

Our synthetic monitoring job managers are [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)-based resources that accept and execute [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/intro-synthetic-monitoring/#types-of-synthetic-monitors) assigned to [private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations).

The job manager can operate in a Docker container system environment, a Podman container system environment, Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, or an OpenShift container system environment. The job manager auto-detects its environment to select the appropriate operating mode.

## Synthetics job manager features [#enhancements]

Because the synthetics job manager operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, we've simplified [installation](#install), [getting started ](#start), and [updating](#install) your job management and orchestration. It also comes with some additional functionality:

* Compatible with Linux, [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
* Enhanced [security](#security) and support for [non-root](#run-as-non-root) user execution.
* Ability to leverage a Docker container as a [sandbox](#docker-dependencies) environment.

## Kubernetes-specific features [#kubernetes-enhancements]

The job manager introduces some additional Kubernetes-specific functionality:

* Uses Kubernetes CronJob resources to run non-ping monitors
* Doesn't require privileged access to the Docker socket
* Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters
* Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd
* Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs
* Allows configurable job runtime (ping, API, and browser) based resource allocation for optimum resource management
* Observability offered via the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer

## System requirements and compatibility [#system-requirements]

To host synthetics job managers, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment.

## Private location key

Before launching synthetics job managers, you must have a [private location key](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations#create-location). Your synthetics job manager uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location.

To find the key for existing private location:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**</DNT>.
2. In the <DNT>**Private locations**</DNT> index, locate the private location you want your synthetics job manager to be assigned to.
3. Note the key associated with the private location with the key <Icon name="fe-key"/>
   icon.

## Install, update, and configure synthetics job manager [#install]

If you're running more than one Docker or Podman private location containers in the same host, you'll have port conflicts. To avoid this port contention, make sure you do the following when you start setting up job managers:

* Run job managers and CPMs on different hosts.
* Run each job manager on a separate host.
* Run each CPM on a different host.

Synthetics job manager images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Go to [hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags) for a list of all the releases.

Unless you are hosting the images in a local image repository, you need to allow connections to `docker.io` through your firewall so that Docker or Podman can pull the synthetics job manager and synthetics runtime images. When the synthetics job manager starts up, the runtime images are pulled automatically. See [Docker environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#docker-env-config), [Podman environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#podman-env-config), and [Kubernetes environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#kubernetes-env-config) for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint.

    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Set up the a namespace for the synthetics job manager in your Kubernetes cluster:

        ```shell
        kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE
        ```
    3. Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo.

       * If you are copying the charts for the first time:

         ```shell
         helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
         ```
       * If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest:

         ```shell
         helm repo update
         ```
    4. Install synthetics job manager with the following Helm command:

       * For a fresh installation of the synthetics job manager:

         ```
         helm install YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-job-manager -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
       * To update an existing synthetics job manager installation:

         ```shell
         helm upgrade YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-job-manager -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
    5. Check if the synthetics job manager pod is up and running:

       ```shell
       kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods
       ```

       Once the `status` attribute of each pod is shown as `running`, your synthetics job manager is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location.

  >

    Ensure you have the [OpenShift CLI (oc)](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc) installed to run commands via OpenShift cli.

    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Login to your OpenShift project:

        ```shell
        oc project your_namespace
        ```

    3. Create image tag using command:

        ```shell
        oc create imagestream image_streame_name -n your_namespace
        ```

    4. Create `buildConfig.yaml`

        ```dockerfile
        apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
        kind: BuildConfig
        metadata:
          name: synthetics-node-api-runtime-build

                  kind: ImageStreamTag
                  name: <image_stream_name>:latest
        ```
    5. Apply the `BuildConfig`:

        ```shell
        oc create -f buildConfig.yaml
        ```

    6. (Optional) Start the build (If build doesn’t auto starts, run this command):

        ```shell
        oc start-build synthetics-node-api-runtime-build -n your-namespace
        ```

       <Callout variant="important">
        Monitor the build progress using:

        ```shell
        oc logs -f bc/synthetics-node-api-runtime-build -n synthetics
        ```
       </Callout>

    7. Deploy with Helm:

        - Run this command to add the New Relic Helm chart repository to your local Helm configuration, allowing you to easily install the Kubernetess integrations.

          ```shell
          helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
          ```

        - Run below command to run SJM in your private location on OpenShift:

          ```shell
          helm install release_name newrelic/synthetics-job-manager -n your_namespace --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=private_location_key --set image_stream_name.image.repository=image_repo --set image_stream_name.appVersionOverride=tag
          ```
            - **release_name**: any name you want to give to your image.
            - **your_namespace**: as mentionml file.
            - **private_location_key**: unique key corresponding to your private location.
            - **image_stream_name**: as mentioned in builded in buildConfig yaConfig yaml file.
            - **tag**: as mentioned in buildConfig yaml file.
            - **image_repo**:
                - run oc registry info in terminal to fetch registry url.
                - image_repo is a combination of registry url, `your_namespace`, `your_output_image_name` as mentioned in buildConfig yaml file separated by forward slash. registery_url/your_namespace/your_output_image_name
          
          Let us consider the following example:

          ```shell
          helm install synthetics-kevin newrelic/synthetics-job-manager -n synthetics --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=<PRIVATE_LOC_KEY>   --set node-api-runtime.image.repository=default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/synthetics/synthetics-node-api-runtime --set node-api-runtime.appVersionOverride=custom
          ```
    8. Check the synthetics job manager pod is up and running:

          ```shell
          oc get pods -n your-namespace
          ```

## Sandboxing and Dependencies [#sandboxing-and-deps]

Sandboxing and dependencies are applicable to the synthetics job manager in a Docker or Podman container system environment.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="docker-dependencies"
    title={<><img src="/images/synthetic_logo_docker.webp" title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Docker dependencies</>}
  >
    The synthetics job manager runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the synthetics job manager creates a brand new Docker container to run it in using the matching runtime.

    The synthetics job manager container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runtime containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the [synthetic monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors) running on the private location the synthetics job manager container is associated with.

    There is a crucial dependency at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that:

    * Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at `/var/run/docker.sock` or `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#environment-variables). For more information, see Docker's [Daemon socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option).

      <Callout variant="caution">
        Core count on the host determines how many runtime containers the synthetics job manager can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runtime containers, we recommend <DNT>**not running multiple synthetics job managers on the same host**</DNT> to avoid resource contention.
      </Callout>

    The synthetics job manager runs in Podman and is able to leverage Podman as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the synthetics job manager creates a brand new Podman container to run it in using the matching runtime.

    The synthetics job manager container needs to be configured to communicate with the Podman engine in order to spawn additional runtime containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the [synthetic monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors) running on the private location the synthetics job manager container is associated with.

    There is a crucial dependency at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that you have:

    1. Installed the Podman [5.0.0-ce](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.0.0) or higher.
    2. Enabled the Rootless execution:
       * Set up Podman to run containers without requiring root privileges.
         ```
         mkdir -p ~/.config/containers
         touch ~/.config/containers/containers.conf
         vi ~/.config/containers/containers.conf
         ```
       * Edit the `containers.conf` file to configure Podman to use `crun` and `systemd`:
         ```
         [engine]
         runtime = "crun"
         cgroup_manager = "systemd"
         ```
    3. Enabled the cgroups v2 (RHEL Only):
       * Edit the GRUB to enable cgroups v2, this ensures compatibility with modern container runtimes in RHEL.
         ```
         sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="/&systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 /' /etc/default/grub
         sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
         sudo reboot
         ```
    4. Enabled the system-wide delegation to allow `cgroups` delegation for the Podman services.
       ```
       sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/
       echo -e "[Service]\nDelegate=yes" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf > /dev/null
       ```
    5. Set up the user-level `systemd` service:
       * Create directories for the user-level `systemd` services.
         ```
         mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/podman.service.d
         ```
       * Add delegate configuration to the user-level `systemd` service.
         ```
         echo -e "[Service]\nDelegate=yes" > ~/.config/systemd/user/podman.service.d/override.conf
         ```
    6. Enabled and started the Podman socket.
       ```
       systemctl --user enable podman.socket
       systemctl --user start podman.socket
       systemctl --user status podman.socket
       ```
    7. Created and configured the Podman API service:
       * Create a Podman API service, sets up Podman to provide HTTP API access.
         ```
         mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
         touch ~/.config/systemd/user/podman-api.service
         vi ~/.config/systemd/user/podman-api.service
         ```
       * Define the service to expose the Podman's API at port 8000.
         ```

## Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root [#security]

By default, the software running inside a synthetics job manager is executed with `root` user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed.

To run the synthetics job manager as a non-root user, additional steps are required:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="run-non-root"
    title={<><img src="/images/synthetic_logo_docker.webp" title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Run as non-root user for Docker</>}
  >
    For more information, see Docker's official documentation about [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/) and [AppArmor security profiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/).

    If your environment requires you to run the synthetics job manager as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is `my_user`.

    1. Ensure that `my_user` can use the Docker engine on the host:

       Verify that `my_user` [belongs to the `"docker"` system group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). Scoped root access to the `docker.sock` is still needed to create bridge networks.

       OR

       Enable the [Docker TCP socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#examples), and pass the `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](#environemnt-variables) to synthetics job manager.
    2. Verify that `my_user` has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to synthetics job manager. To set these permission, use the `chmod` command.
    3. Get the `uid` of `my_user` for use in the run command: `id -u my_user`.

       Once these conditions are met, use the option `"-u <uid>:<gid>"` when launching synthetics job manager:

       ```shell
       docker run ... -u 1002 ...
       ```

       OR

       ```shell
       docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ...
       ```

    * For a synthetics job manager in the **OpenShift** and **Kubernetes** container orchestration system environment, the following Helm `show` commands can be used to view the `chart.yaml` and the `values.yaml`, respectively:

      ```shell
      helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-job-manager

  <Collapser
    id="network"
    title="Network settings"
  >
    For both Docker and Kubernetes, the synthetics job manager and its runtime containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/).

    A bridge network is created for communication between the synthetics job manager and runtime containers. This means networking command options like `--network` and `--dns` passed to the synthetics job manager container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runtime containers.

    When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).

    In case of Podman, we don't use bridge network for communication between the synthetics job manager and runtime containers instead we use a Podman Pod. All containers in a Podman pod share the same network namespace. This means they share the same IP address within that pod. In this case the although the containers share the same IP, their services are exposed on different ports.

    A single synthetics job manager Docker image serves the **Docker**, **Podman**, **OpenShift**, and **Kubernetes** container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on the Docker Hub. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the [Docker Hub newrelic/synthetics-job-manager repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags).

        Synthetics job managers without Internet access
      </td>

      <td>
        A synthetics job manager can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The synthetics job manager needs to be able to contact the `"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net"` domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions.

      <td>
        To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the [environment variables](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration#environment-variables) named `HORDE_API_PROXY*.`

        Arguments passed at launch

      <td>
        This applies to Docker and Podman container environment only. Arguments passed to the synthetics job manager container at launch do not get passed on to the runtime containers spawned by the synthetics job manager. Docker and Podman has no concept of "inheritance" or a "hierarchy" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from synthetics job manager to the runtime containers. However, in case of Podman arguments passed at the pod level are shared between the synthetics job manager and runtime containers with in the pod. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/) level.
