Our synthetic monitoring job managers are [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)-based resources that accept and execute [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetics-monitors) assigned to [private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations).

The job manager can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The job manager will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode.

## Synthetics job manager features [#enhancements]

Because the synthetics job manager operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, we've simplified [installation](#install), [getting started ](#start), and [updating](#install) your job management and orchestration. It also comes with some additional functionality: 

* Compatible with Linux, [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
* Enhanced [security](#security) and support for [non-root](#run-as-non-root) user execution.
* Ability to leverage a Docker container as a [sandbox](#sandboxing-and-docker-deps) environment.

## Kubernetes-specific features [#kubernetes-enhancements]

The job manager introduces some additional Kubernetes-specific functionality: 

* Uses Kubernetes CronJob resources to run non-ping monitors 
* Doesn't require privileged access to the Docker socket
* Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters
* Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd
* Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs
* Allows configurable job runtime (ping, API, and browser) based resource allocation for optimum resource management
* Observability offered via the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer

## System requirements and compatibility [#system-requirements]

To host synthetics job managers, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment.

## Private location key

Before launching synthetics job managers, you must have a [private location key](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations#create-location). Your synthetics job manager uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location.

To find the key for existing private location:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Private locations](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/private-location-list)**.
2. In the **Private locations** index, locate the private location you want your synthetics job manager to be assigned to.
3. Note the key associated with the private location with the key <Icon name="fe-key"/>
  icon.

## Install, update, and configure synthetics job manager [#install]

Synthetics job manager images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Go to [hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags) for a list of all the releases.

Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, you need to allow connections to `docker.io` through your firewall so Docker can pull the synthetics job manager and synthetics runtime images. When the synthetics job manager starts up, the runtime images are pulled automatically. See [Docker environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#docker-env-config) and [Kubernetes environment configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#kubernetes-env-config) for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint.

For more details on advanced configuration settings, see [synthetics job manager configuration](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration).

  >
    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Ensure you've enabled [Docker dependencies](#sandboxing-and-docker-deps) for sandboxing and [installed](#install-update) synthetics job manager on your system.
    3. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common default `/var/run/docker.sock` in the following examples to match your system.

       * Linux/macOS:

         ```
         docker run \
             --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \
             -e "PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY" \
             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
             -d \
             --restart unless-stopped \
             newrelic/synthetics-job-manager:latest
         ```
       * Windows:

         ```
         docker run ^
             --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^
             -e "PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY" ^
             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^
             -d ^
             --restart unless-stopped ^
             newrelic/synthetics-job-manager:latest
         ```

       View the logs for your minion container:

       ```
       docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
       ```
  </Collapser>

  >
    
    1. Locate your [private location key](#private-location-key).
    2. Set up the a namespace for the synthetics job manager in your Kubernetes cluster:

       ```
       kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```
    3. Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo.

       * If you are copying the charts for the first time:

         ```
         helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
         ```
       * If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest:

         ```
         helm repo update
         ```
    4. Install synthetics job manager with the following Helm command:
       * For a fresh installation of the synthetics job manager:

         ```
         helm install YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-job-manager -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
       * To update an existing synthetics job manager installation:

         ```
         helm upgrade YOUR_JOB_MANAGER_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-job-manager -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY
         ```
    5. Check if the synthetics job manager pod is up and running:

       ```
       kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods
       ```

       Once the `status` attribute of each pod is shown as `running`, your synthetics job manager is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location.

## Stop or delete the synthetics job manager [#stop]

On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker `stop` procedure to stop the synthetics job manager from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes `delete` procedure to stop the synthetics job manager from running.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="docker-stop"
    title={<><img src={syntheticDocker} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Docker stop procedure</>}
  >
    You can [stop a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/) either by the container name, or the container ID.

    * Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows:

      ```
      docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
        docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
      ```
    * Container ID stop for Linux/macOS:

      In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit `docker rm $CONTAINER_ID`.

      ```
      CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME)
        docker stop $CONTAINER_ID
        docker rm $CONTAINER_ID
      ```
    * Container ID stop for Windows:

      In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit `docker rm $CONTAINER_ID`.

      ```
      FOR /F "tokens=*" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID)
        docker stop %CONTAINER_ID%
        docker rm %CONTAINER_ID%

  >
  
    1. Get the JOB_MANAGER_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the synthetics job manager pod you want to delete:

       ```
       helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```
    2. Delete the minion pod:

       ```
       helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE JOB_MANAGER_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME
       ```
    3. Delete the namespace set up for the synthetics job manager in your Kubernetes cluster:

       ```
       kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE
       ```

## Sandboxing and Docker dependencies [#sandboxing-and-docker-deps]

Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the synthetics job manager in a Docker container system environment.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="docker-dependencies"
    title={<><img src={syntheticDocker} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Docker dependencies</>}
  >
    The synthetics job manager runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the synthetics job manager creates a brand new Docker container to run it in using the matching runtime.

    The synthetics job manager container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runtime containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the [synthetic monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors) running on the private location the synthetics job manager container is associated with.

    There is a crucial dependency at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that:

    * Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at `/var/run/docker.sock` or `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration/#environment-variables). For more information, see Docker's [Daemon socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option).

      <Callout variant="caution">
        Core count on the host determines how many runtime containers the synthetics job manager can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runtime containers, we recommend **not running multiple synthetics job managers on the same host** to avoid resource contention.
      </Callout>

      For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see [Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root](#run-non-root).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root [#security]

By default, the software running inside a synthetics job manager is executed with `root` user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed.

To run the synthetics job manager as a non-root user, additional steps are required:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="run-non-root"
    title={<><img src={syntheticDocker} title="Docker icon" alt="Docker icon" style={{ height: '35px', width: '40px' }}/>Run as non-root user for Docker</>}
  >
    For more information, see Docker's official documentation about [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/) and [AppArmor security profiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/).

    If your environment requires you to run the synthetics job manager as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is `my_user`.

    1. Ensure that `my_user` can use the Docker engine on the host:

      Verify that `my_user` [belongs to the `"docker"` system group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). Scoped root access to the `docker.sock` is still needed to create bridge networks.

      OR

      Enable the [Docker TCP socket option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#examples), and pass the `DOCKER_HOST` [environment variable](#environemnt-variables) to synthetics job manager.
    2. Verify that `my_user` has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to synthetics job manager. To set these permission, use the `chmod` command.
    3. Get the `uid` of `my_user` for use in the run command: `id -u my_user`.

      Once these conditions are met, use the option `"-u <uid>:<gid>"` when launching synthetics job manager:

      ```
      docker run ... -u 1002 ...
      ```

      OR

      ```
      docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ...
      ```

  For both Docker and Kubernetes, the synthetics job manager and its runtime containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/).

  A bridge network is created for communication between the synthetics job manager and runtime containers. This means networking command options like `--network` and `--dns` passed to the synthetics job manager container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runtime containers.

  When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).

A single synthetics job manager Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on Docker Hub. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the [Docker Hub newrelic/synthetics-job-manager repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-job-manager/tags).

        Synthetics job managers without Internet access
      </td>

      <td>
        A synthetics job manager can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The synthetics job manager needs to be able to contact the `"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net"` domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions.

        Communicate with synthetics via a proxy
      </td>

      <td>
        To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the [environment variables](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-configuration#environment-variables) named `HORDE_API_PROXY*.`

        Arguments passed at launch
      </td>

      <td>
        This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the synthetics job manager container at launch do not get passed on to the runtime containers spawned by the synthetics job manager. Docker has no concept of "inheritance" or a "hierarchy" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from synthetics job manager to the runtime containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/) level.
