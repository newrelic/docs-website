If you want to receive alert notifications when a synthetic monitor fails, you can configure the alert notification after you have created one. You can configure your monitor's alert condition via the [alerts UI](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To identify which monitors [do not have conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies) assigned to them, review their color-coded health status.

## Add a synthetic monitor to alert policies [#alerts-existing-monitor]

A monitor can be included in multiple alert policies and conditions. You can [view the alert policies and conditions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/view-monitors-alert-policies-conditions) for the selected monitor from the <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> UI.

To add an existing monitor to an alert policy:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Alerts > Alert policies](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/condition-builder/policy-list).**</DNT>
2. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added.
3. Open the policy, then click <DNT>**+ New alert condition**</DNT>.
4. Click <DNT>**Use guided mode**</DNT>.
5. Click <DNT>**Synthetic monitors**</DNT> and then click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
6. Select your synthetic monitor from the list, select the metric to monitor, and then click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
7. Fill out the [remaining settings](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#query-order) and click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.
8. Name your alert condition, set additional optional settings, and click <DNT>**Save condition**</DNT>.

## Existing monitor: Remove from alert policy [#alerts-remove-monitor]

To remove an existing monitor's alert condition from an existing alert policy:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Alerts > Alert policies](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/condition-builder/policy-list).**</DNT>
2. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate and select an alert policy where the monitor has an alert condition that has already been added.
3. Select <DNT>**Delete**</DNT> from the action menu for the alert condition.

## Receive alert notifications on a three-strike basis [#receiving]

Synthetic alert monitors operate on a three-strike basis, registering a failure only after three monitor attempts from a single location return an error. Your [alert policy configuration](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow) and [notification channel settings](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) will determine when you receive notifications for specific monitors and locations.

If you monitor a non-public app and add your selected public minion IPs to your allow list, you may very infrequently receive a false downtime alert. When a synthetic monitoring data center goes down, New Relic may decide to temporarily use an alternate host, which results in the temporary server's IP being blocked by your app.

## Mute (disable) monitor's alert notifications [#mute]

<Callout variant="important">
  The muted monitor status will be removed on [February 29, 2024](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAX8W0000015BHc/endoflife-product-updates-july-2023-september-2023). Please use monitor downtime or muting rules instead.
</Callout>

Use [Monitor Downtimes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/) to stop the execution of synthetic monitors.

Use [Muting Rules](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) to prevent notifications from being sent from alert conditions that include synthetic monitors.
