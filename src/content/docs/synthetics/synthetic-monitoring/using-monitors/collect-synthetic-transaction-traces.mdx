Synthetic transaction traces connect your [synthetic results](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/viewing-monitor-results) to [APM transaction traces](/docs/apm/traces/transaction-traces/transaction-traces). While synthetic results capture browser-side details from each synthetic check, transaction traces capture the activity on your app server. When you connect synthetic monitors to APM, you can view both sides of every synthetic's run.

<Callout variant="important">
  Synthetic monitoring and <InlinePopover type="apm" /> must be on the same account for transaction traces to make these connections.
</Callout>

## Enable synthetic transaction traces [#enabling]

Synthetic transaction traces are enabled by default in the following <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent versions:

* **Java**: 3.14.0 or higher
* **.NET**: 3.10.43.0 or higher
* **Node.js**: 1.16.1 or higher
* **PHP**: 4.18.0.89 or higher
* **Python**: 2.40.0.34 or higher
* **Ruby**: 3.9.7 or higher

## View synthetic transaction traces [#viewing]

To view synthetic transaction traces, create a monitor that checks a website for which you have enabled synthetic transaction traces. Then, from the **Summary** page in the Synthetics UI, click a dot in a location chart to open the result details. Hover over any of the timeline charts to get links to transaction traces.

  With the new Summary view enabled, you can click any data point in location charts to access the waterfall result details.

New Relic collects up to 20 synthetic transaction traces per application each minute. If your app receives more than 20 synthetic checks per minute, not every synthetic result will include a synthetic trace.
