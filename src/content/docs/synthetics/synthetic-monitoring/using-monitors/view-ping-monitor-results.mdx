Synthetic monitoring automatically records all **ping** monitor checks, allowing you to see the load time and response size for every run.

Use the [explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) and the selected ping monitor's **Summary** and **Results** pages to:

* Select a resource to view load timing, response and request headers, and other details.
* Use these details to find problems and diagnose performance issues.

  For information on **simple** or **scripted** monitors, see [View simple or scripted monitor results](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/view-ping-monitor-results).

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**.
2. Sort by **Monitor Type** using the query `monitorType=ping`.
3. To view specific information about a monitor, such as page load time and availability, select a ping monitor to access the selected monitor's **Summary** and **Results** pages.

## Timing details [#viewing-logs]

For some monitor types, the overall monitor check duration will be larger than the individual page request durations. This is because some browser behaviors are not measured individually but still count towards the total check time.

Examples of unmeasured behaviors include:

* JavaScript interactions
* Resource pre-fetching and prioritization
* DNS pre-resolve
* TCP pre-connect
* Page pre-rendering
