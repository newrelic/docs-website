Schedule **monitor downtimes** to specify times that your synthetic [monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#types-monitors) cease alerting, while still preserving your [SLA report metrics](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/pages/synthetics-sla-report-aggregate-monitor-metrics). Monitor downtimes are ideal for:

* Routine maintenance
* Planned outages
* Deployments
* Service interruptions

<Callout variant="important">
  During synthetic monitor downtimes, your selected monitors stop running until their scheduled end time. To temporarily disable alerts without pausing your monitors, [mute them](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications) instead.

## Monitor downtime tips [#tips]

The maximum duration for a monitor downtime is 24 hours. If you need your downtime to last longer than 24 hours, create multiple monitor downtimes or use a recurring downtime.

If the start and end times of a monitor downtime span midnight, the monitor downtime will last until the next day at the end time specified. For example, a start time of 11:30PM and an end time of 5:00AM would start on the day listed and last until 5:00AM the next day.

## Create recurring monitor downtimes [#create-window]

<Callout variant="tip">
  The ability to add, edit, or delete monitor downtimes depends on [your access to features](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
</Callout>

Create recurring monitor downtimes for routine monitor maintenance or regularly scheduled outages. To create a recurring monitor downtime:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Synthetic monitoring >Monitor downtime**.
2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   Create monitor downtime**.
3. Specify a name for the monitor downtime.
4. Select a daily, weekly, or monthly frequency. Choose additional scheduling options, such as day of the week, time of day, and how long the window lasts. 
5. Select the monitors that you would like to be included in the monitor downtime. There is no maximum for the amount of monitors that can be selected.
6. Select **Create**.

## Create a one-time monitor downtime [#one-time]

For spontaneous maintenance or service interruptions, create one-time monitor downtimes that will not reoccur. To create a non-recurring monitor downtime:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Synthetic monitoring >Monitor downtime**.
2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   Create monitor downtime**.
3. Specify a name for the new monitor downtime.
4. Select **once** for the frequency, along with the date and start time for the monitor downtime.
5. Select the monitors to include in the monitor downtime. There is no maximum for the amount of monitors that can be selected.
6. Select **Create**.

## Delete a monitor downtime [#delete]

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are unable to delete a window, check your [permissions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/synthetics-permissions-user-groups).
</Callout>

To delete an existing monitor downtime:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Synthetic monitoring >Monitor downtime**.
2. Locate the monitor downtime to be deleted in the index.
3. Select the ellipsis **<Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
   ** icon, and then **Delete**.

## Edit a monitor downtime [#edit]

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are unable to edit a window, check your [permissions](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/user-roles-synthetic-monitoring/).
</Callout>

To edit an existing monitor downtime:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Synthetic monitoring >Monitor downtime.**
2. Locate the monitor downtime to be edited in the monitor downtime index.
3. Select the ellipsis **<Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
   ** icon for the downtime you want to edit.
4. Edit the name or frequency of the monitor downtime. To remove a monitor from the list of targets, locate the monitor in the list of **Selected targets** and select the remove **<Icon name="fe-x-circle"/>
   ** icon next to the monitor.
5. Once you've finished editing, select **Save**.
