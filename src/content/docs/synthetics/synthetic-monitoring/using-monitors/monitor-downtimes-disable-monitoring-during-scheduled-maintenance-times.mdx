Schedule **monitor downtimes** to specify times that your synthetic [monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#types-monitors) cease alerting, while still preserving your [SLA report metrics](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/pages/synthetics-sla-report-aggregate-monitor-metrics). Monitor downtimes are ideal for:

* Routine maintenance
* Planned outages
* Deployments
* Service interruptions

<Callout variant="important">
  During synthetic monitor downtimes, your selected monitors stop running until their scheduled end time. To temporarily disable alerts without pausing your monitors, [mute them](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/alerting-synthetics#mute) instead.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
  The ability to add, edit, or delete monitor downtimes depends on [your access to features](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).

## Create recurring monitor downtimes [#create-window]

Create recurring monitor downtimes for routine monitor maintenance or regularly scheduled outages. To create a recurring monitor downtime:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > Monitor downtime**.
2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   Create monitor downtime**.
3. Specify a name for the monitor downtime.
4. Select a daily, weekly, or monthly frequency. Choose additional scheduling options, such as day of the week, time of day, and how long the window will last.
5. Select the monitors that you would like to be included in the monitor downtime. There is no maximum for the amount of monitors that can be selected.
6. Select **Create**.

## Create a one-time monitor downtime [#one-time]

For spontaneous maintenance or service interruptions, create one-time monitor downtimes that will not reoccur. To create a non-recurring monitor downtime:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > Monitor downtime**.
2. Select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   Create monitor downtime**.
3. Specify a name for the new monitor downtime.
4. Select **once** for the frequency, along with the date and start time for the monitor downtime.
5. Select the monitors to include in the monitor downtime. There is no maximum for the amount of monitors that can be selected.
6. Select **Create**.

## View downtime monitors [#view]

Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> Synthetics > (select your monitor) > Summary**. When a monitor downtime occurs, it will be visible on your [**Summary** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/pages/synthetics-overview-page-view-monitors-performance) within the **Load time chart** as a yellow vertical line. To see which monitor downtime occurred within the chart, hover over the yellow line to view the monitor downtime name.

You can view additional details in the **Results** and **Resources** sections.
