Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. Monitors can:

* Capture aggregate numbers, including an overview or summary.
* Provide detailed statistics about downtime incidents and page resources.
* Collect custom response codes that detail your monitor performance.

You can create synthetic monitors without installation. To get started:

1. [Create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). 
2. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Create a monitor](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/monitor-create)**, then select the monitor you'd like to create. If it's your first time, we recommend creating a ping or step monitor to start.  

## Create a monitor [#adding-monitors]

Ready to monitor your web apps with one (or several!) of our [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/intro-synthetic-monitoring/#types-of-synthetic-monitors)? The steps below walk you through the process for all our monitors.

    title="Add a ping or simple browser monitor"
  >
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring > Create monitor](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets/monitor-create)**
    2. Click the **Availability** tile for ping monitors or **Page load performance** for simple browser monitors. 
    3. Optional: Set up [alert notifications](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/alerting-synthetics).

Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the [**Monitors** index](/docs/new-relic-one-monitors-index).

You have some additional configuration options for your ping or simple browser monitor. For both monitor types, you can set up:

       * A **validation string** that enables substring monitoring for [response validation](#response-validation).
       * **Custom Headers** that will accompany requests submitted by your monitors.
       * **Verify SSL** to validate the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax:

        ```
        openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null
        ```

        If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail.
        
With only ping monitors, you can choose to set up: 

       * The **Bypass HEAD request** option to skip the default `HEAD` request and use the `GET` verb instead.
       * **Redirect is Failure**, which will categorize the redirect as a failure, rather than following the redirect to the new URL.
       * **Custom Headers** can be added to ping and simple browser monitors. These headers will be added to requests submitted by the monitor.

With only simple browser monitors, you can configure [device emulation](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/device-emulation) settings, including device type and screen orientation.

Wanting to deploy more than a single monitor at a time? We recommend checking out the [NerdGraph API synthetic monitoring tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial). You can automate monitor creation with API calls.

You can also create monitors with our [synthetic monitoring REST API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-via-rest-api). For REST APIs, make a `GET` request to retrieve the configuration details of your chosen synthetic monitor. Once you've retrieved that data, use `POST` to create a "copy" of your chosen monitor.

You must have [Admin privileges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/user-roles-synthetic-monitoring/) in order to delete a monitor.

To delete a monitor:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. Click **General**, then click the delete monitor button.

You can also delete a monitor with our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial) or the [synthetic monitoring REST API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-via-rest-api#delete-monitor).

## Monitor settings [#settings]

When configuring monitors, the following settings are available:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="setting-type"
    title="Type"
  >
    Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's [type](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/types-synthetics-monitors#types-monitors) can't be changed after the monitor is created.

    * **Ping**: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable [timeout](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers#waiting-elements) for this monitor is 60 seconds.
    * **Simple browser**: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each [frequency interval](#setting-frequency), New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable [timeout](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers/#waiting-elements) for this monitor is 60 seconds.
    * **Scripted browser**: [Create a script](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/writing-synthetic-scripts) to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable [timeout](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers#waiting-elements) for this monitor is 180 seconds.
    * **API test**: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see [Write API tests](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/writing-api-tests). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="setting-name"
    title="Monitor name"
  >
    Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (`<` and `>`). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (`&lt;` for `<` and `&gt;` for `>`) in the UI or API.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="setting-location"
    title="Location"
  >
    Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any [private locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations), they will be listed here too. You can use the [Synthetics API `location` endpoint](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-via-rest-api#list-locations) to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account.

    Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each [frequency interval](#setting-frequency). For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="setting-frequency"
    title="Frequency"
  >
    Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each [location](#setting-location). For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of **15 minutes**, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="setting-alerts"
    title="Alerts"
  >
    Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see [Alerting for synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/alerting-synthetics).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="response-validation"
    title="Response Validation (optional)"
  >
    Specify text to search for on the page DOM. When using simple browser or ping [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors/#types-monitors), there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="apdex-t"
    title="Apdex T (optional)"
  >
    Specify the threshold for the **tolerable** response times for your monitor. The default value is 7 seconds (7000ms). For more information, see [Understand SLA report metrics](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/pages/synthetic-monitoring-aggregate-monitor-metrics/#understanding).
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>
