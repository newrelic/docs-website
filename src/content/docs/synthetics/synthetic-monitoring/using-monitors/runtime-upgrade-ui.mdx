Use the synthetics runtime upgrades UI if your monitors use legacy runtimes, including Chrome 72, Node 10, or lower. We recommend you update to our newest runtimes. They have [more features](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/). They also work with browser versions closer to those used by your users.

The synthetics runtime upgrade UI is a central place to view all monitors that use legacy runtimes. It also allows you to update them to the newest runtimes.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Users need the [bulk runtime upgrade permission](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#synthetics) to update runtimes using the UI. This permission allows them to make changes to multiple runtimes at once. Without this permission, users can't apply bulk updates. [All product admin](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) have this permission by default, but you can add it to [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles) to meet your organization's requirements.

[Synthetics private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations/) must have [synthetics job manager](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/) installed to run monitors using the Chrome 100+ or Node 16.10 runtimes.

## Proactive upgrade testing [#proactive]

We will test all synthetic monitors using legacy runtimes against our latest runtimes in a proactive way. This testing:

* It happens once and will only trigger again if someone updates the monitor.
* Is used only to populate the runtime upgrade UI.
* Doesn't [consume synthetic checks](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/monitor-limits/#edition-limits).
* Doesn't populate the results UI for the monitor.
* Doesn't create `SyntheticCheck`, `SyntheticRequest`, or any other job artifacts.

Each upgrade test result will populate the runtime upgrade UI in one of three tabs:

<Collapser
  id="passed"
  title="Passed"
>
  This group of monitors completed successfully when tested in our latest runtimes. We recommend using the [Upgrade all button](#upgrade) to upgrade all of these monitors to the new runtime.
</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="failed"
  title="Failed"
>
  This group of monitors failed when tested in our latest runtimes. This can happen if the monitor is failing in the legacy runtime. Or, it may be due to a script update due to incompatibility between the runtimes. While we have provided as much backward compatibility as possible, there are a few breaking changes.

  We recommend [troubleshooting](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/troubleshooting/runtime-upgrade-troubleshooting/) and [upgrading these monitors individually](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/#runtime-convert). You can do this by changing the runtime dropdown in the monitor configuration. Then, use validate to test the monitor while making script updates.

  <Callout variant="tip">
    We don't recommend the upgrade of all failed monitors.
  </Callout>
</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="blocked"
  title="Blocked"
>
  Since the monitors were incompatible with the latest runtime, testing was impossible. This happens when setting up the monitor for a private location that doesn't yet use the [synthetics job manager](#requirements). Once you install a synthetics job manager, it will trigger the runtime upgrade testing for these monitors. Once testing completes, the monitors will move from the blocked tab to the [passed](#passed) or [failed](#failed) tab.

  You can't force the upgrade of locked monitors from the runtime upgrade UI. This would prevent the monitors from running.
</Collapser>

## Upgrade runtimes [#upgrade]

You can select and upgrade individual monitors from each tab. You can also use the **Upgrade all** button to upgrade all monitors with that status, passed or failed, at once.

Monitors may take up to 10 minutes to start using the new runtime after upgrading using the runtime upgrade UI.

## Programmatic runtime upgrades [#programmaticUpgrade]

Runtime upgrade test results are [available via NerdGraph](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#query-runtime-upgrade-status).

NerdGraph mutations can be used to [update monitor runtimes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#upgrade-monitor-runtime)

## Downgrade runtimes [#downgrade]

Using the monitor settings UI, you can downgrade a specific monitor to legacy runtimes. The runtime upgrade UI doesn't allow you to bulk downgrade monitor runtimes.
