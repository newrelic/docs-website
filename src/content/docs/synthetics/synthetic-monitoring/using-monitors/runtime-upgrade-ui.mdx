If your monitors use legacy runtimes, including Chrome 72, Node 10, or older, we recommend updating to our newest runtimes to take advantage of [additional features](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/) and use browser versions closer to the versions used by your customers. 

The synthetics runtime upgrade UI provides a central location to view all monitors that use legacy runtimes and bulk update those monitors to the newest runtimes.

## Requirements [#requirements]

All users with access to synthetics will be able to view the runtime upgrade UI, but user must be granted the [Monitors -> Bulk runtime upgrade permission](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#synthetics) to use the UI to update runtimes. This permission is granted to the [all product admin](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) by default, but can be added to [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles) to meet your organization's requirements.

[Synthetics private locations](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations/) must have [synthetics job manager](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/) installed to run monitors using the Chrome 100+ or Node 16.10 runtimes. 

## Proactive upgrade testing [#proactive]

All synthetic monitors using legacy runtimes will be proactively tested against our latest runtimes. This testing:

* Occurs once and will only be triggered again if the monitor is updated
* Is used only to populate the runtime upgrade UI
* Does not [consume synthetic checks](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/monitor-limits/#edition-limits)
* Does not populate the Results UI for the monitor
* Does not create SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, or any other job artifacts

Each upgrade test result will populate the runtime upgrade UI in one of three tabs:

<Collapser
  id="passed"
  title="Passed"
>

This group of monitors completed successfully when tested in our latest runtimes. We recommend using the [Upgrade all button](#upgrade) to upgrade all of these monitors to the new runtime.

</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="failed"
  title="Failed"
>

This group of monitors failed when tested in our latest runtimes. This can occur if the monitor is currently failing in the legacy runtime or if a script update is required due to incompatibility between the runtimes. While we have provided as much backward compatibility as possible, there are a few breaking changes. 

We recommend [troubleshooting](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/troubleshooting/runtime-upgrade-troubleshooting/) and [upgrading these monitors individually](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/#runtime-convert). This can be done by changing the runtime dropdown in the monitor configuration and using validate to test the monitor while making script updates.

**Upgrading all failed monitors is not recommended.**

</Collapser>


<Collapser
  id="blocked"
  title="Blocked"
>

This group of monitors could not be tested with the latest runtime. This occurs when the monitor is [configured to use a private location and that private location is not yet using synthetics job manager](#requirements). Runtime upgrade testing for these monitors will be triggered once a synthetics job manager is installed. Once that testing is complete, the monitors will move from the blocked tab to either the [passed](#passed) or [failed](#failed) tab.

Forcing the upgrade of blocked monitors from the runtime upgrade UI is not permitted. Doing so would prevent the monitors from running.

</Collapser>

## Upgrade runtimes [#upgrade]

Individual monitors can be selected and upgraded from each tab or the upgrade all button can be used to upgrade all monitors with that status (passed or failed) at one time.

It may take up to 10 minutes for monitors to start using the new runtime after they have been upgraded using the runtime upgrade UI. 

## Downgrade runtimes [#downgrade]

Monitors can be individually downgraded to legacy runtimes using the monitor settings UI. The runtime upgrade UI does not allow you to bulk downgrade monitor runtimes.
