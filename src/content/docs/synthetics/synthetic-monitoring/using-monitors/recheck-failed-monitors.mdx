You can use synthetic monitoring's rechecks to rerun a failed monitor check. All rechecks begin immediately at a single location. This makes it easy to verify a single failing location or result.

Additionally, all recheck data appears as a standard monitor datapoint and result. This allows you to view monitor checks in context with the overall monitor performance.

## View and recheck failed monitor results [#ui]

Use the <Icon name="fe-rotate-cw"/>
**Run check** buttons appear on monitor result details pages if:

* The result has a `FAILED` status.
* The result occurred in the past 24 hours.
* The monitor has not been edited since the result occurred.

To view a failed monitor's results and recheck it:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)**, then select a monitor.
2. From the monitor's **Failures** page, select a link from the table.

   OR

   From the monitor's [**Results** page](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/view-monitor-results), use the filter or sort options to select a location indicating **Results: Failed**.
3. Review the failed check details, then click <Icon name="fe-rotate-cw"/>
   **Run check**.
4. To view the updated status, click **See results**.

  **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)** (select a monitor) > **Failures** > (select a check failure):** To view details about a failed monitor check, click <Icon name="fe-rotate-cw"/>
  **Run check**.

When you click <Icon name="fe-rotate-cw"/>
**Run check**, New Relic triggers an immediate recheck using the result's location and the monitor's current configuration. Once the job is completed, the button will display the recheck's status (`Success` or `Failure`). To view the recheck **Results** page again, click the button again.

Running a recheck will also log a synthetic audit event that you can [query using NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql). For example:

```
SELECT * from NrAuditEvent 
WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.re_check_job'
```
