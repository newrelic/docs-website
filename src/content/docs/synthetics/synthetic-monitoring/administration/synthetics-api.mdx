We have two options for managing your New Relic synthetic monitors via API: 

* NerdGraph (recommended): this is the primary and recommended way. See [our NerdGraph synthetics tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial).
* REST API: Some customers prefer to use our older REST API. See [Synthetics REST API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api)

For an overview of all our available APIs, see [Intro to APIs](/docs/apis/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apis). If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.
