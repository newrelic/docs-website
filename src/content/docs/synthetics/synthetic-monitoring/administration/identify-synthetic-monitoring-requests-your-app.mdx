[Synthetic monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors) requests include an `X-Abuse-Info` request header field, so you can identify the New Relic synthetic monitoring account and the monitor that sent it. Use that information to:

* Access the monitor results (if you have access to the account).
* Disable the monitor (if you have access to the account).

## Identify the account or monitor [#identify-monitor]

To identify the synthetics account and monitor ID that sent the request, check the `X-Abuse-Info` request header field. For example:

```
X-Abuse-Info: Request sent by a synthetic monitor (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/identify-synthetics-requests-your-app) - monitor id: ${MONITOR_ID_STRING} | account id: ${ACCOUNT_NUMBER}
```

## Access or disable monitor [#enable-disable]

If you have access to the account that the monitor request came from, you can view monitor results or disable the monitor in the New Relic UI:

1. [Identify](#identify-monitor) the account number and monitor ID that sent the request.
2. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Synthetic monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics-nerdlets)** and select a monitor.
3. Click **General** under **Settings**.
4. Click the **Monitor** toggle to set it to **Disabled**.
