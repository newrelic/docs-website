New Relic uses public minions to execute your [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors). These minions are deployed in different data centers around the globe and are in charge of running your monitors.

Because of this, ensure your firewall allows synthetics network requests. Minion IP addresses are publicly available in JSON format, so you can easily read and parse them.

<Callout variant="important">
  Please ensure your allow list or related configurations include all ranges in the [IP range lists](#dynamic-ip-addresses) as requests could be sent from either environment. 
</Callout>

**Optional steps**:

* You can automate your rules for your allow list based on these files.
* You can identify synthetic monitor requests using [our standard headers](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/administration/identify-synthetics-requests-your-app) or by adding a custom header to your [ping / simple browser monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/#simple), [scripted API monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/write-synthetic-api-tests/#request-options), or [scripted browser monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/synthetic-scripted-browser-reference-monitor-versions-chrome-100#structure).

## IP addresses are not personal data [#not-personal-data]

Minions are deployed on servers, and the agents are activated using non-personal credentials. IP addresses associated with minions running on servers are not personal data under data protection and privacy laws. For more information, see the [Synthetic's security documentation](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/security-new-relic-synthetics).

## Daily JSON listings for IP addresses [#dynamic-ip-addresses]

IP addresses for released locations are subject to change. If a change is needed, we'll attempt to proactively notify customers prior to any changes via e-mail. You can also check the [Support Forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com/) for updates. The IP ranges listed are reserved for use by New Relic and cannot be used by anyone else.

Monitors using legacy runtimes, which include scripted browser monitors using Chrome 72 or lower, scripted API monitors using Node 10 or lower, step monitors, broken link monitors, and certificate check monitors utilize /32 IP ranges.

Monitors using [new runtimes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/), which include all ping and simple browser monitors, scripted browser monitors using Chrome 100, and scripted API monitors using Node 16.10 will use larger IP ranges.

<Callout variant="important">
  All legacy runtime monitors will be migrated from smaller /32 IP ranges to the larger IP ranges listed for each public location starting on January 31, 2023. The larger IP ranges have been in use since October 2022 for all existing ping, simple browser, and monitors using newer runtimes. No impact is expected from this change.

## Public minion locations and location labels [#location]

The following table cross-references the synthetic's public minion locations with their location labels. You can [query](/docs/query-your-data) the `location` and `locationLabel` attributes from the [SyntheticCheck](/docs/insights/explore-data/attributes/synthetics-default-attributes-insights#syntheticcheck-table) and [SyntheticRequest](/docs/insights/explore-data/attributes/synthetics-default-attributes-insights#syntheticrequest-table) events.

Using NerdGraph? You don't need the `AWS_` prefix, as shown in the [NerdGraph synthetics docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#location-field).
