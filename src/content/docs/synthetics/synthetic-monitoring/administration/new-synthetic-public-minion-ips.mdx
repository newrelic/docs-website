metaDescription: 'New runtime capabilities for synthetic monitoring may require you update your firewall allow list to accept network requests from new IP address ranges'
---

Additional [source IP address ranges](#us_new_ip) will be added on October 3, 2022 to support the continued growth of synthetics. As a result, you may need to reconfigure your firewall's allow list, bot detection software, and other related applications to accept network requests from additional IP address ranges. Please ensure your configurations include these [new IP ranges](#us_new_ip) in addition to the IP and IP range JSON listings in our [synthetic monitor public minion IP documentation](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/synthetic-public-minion-ips/)

## New IP address ranges for public minions [#us_new_ip]

Additional IP address ranges will be added on October 3, 2022. These ranges cover both US and EU data centers. These are in addition to the existing [IP range JSON listing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/synthetic-public-minion-ips/#dynamic-ip-addresses). The JSON list will be updated to include these additional IP ranges before they are used.
