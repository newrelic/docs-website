If you're a [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), you theoretically have full access to all New Relic features, but whether you can use all those features depends on what role you're assigned within your New Relic organization.

Permissions-related details depend on whether a New Relic user is on our newer user model or our original [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models).

## Users on our newer user model [#new-pricing]

For details on how New Relic permissions work, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#groups). To see the granular synthetics-related capabilities, see [Capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-capabilities/#synthetics).

## Users on original user model [#original-pricing]

For users on our original user model, here are some details: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="default-access"
    title="Original user model - default access"
  >

* [Admins](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#roles) have full access to all synthetic monitoring features on an account.
* [Users](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) have access to all synthetic monitoring features except [secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers) and the ability to delete monitors, monitor downtime, and private locations.
* [Restricted Users](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#roles) on accounts with original product-based pricing have view-only access to all synthetic monitoring features except:

  * [Secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers)
  * Private locations (although they can query a limited amount of data via NRQL)

  This means that users with this role do not have access to all create, edit, and delete capabilities for synthetic monitoring features (as well as view capability for secure credentials) until they are given a role with the appropriate capabilities.

To get started, follow [standard procedures to create a custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-roles-permissions#create/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-roles-permissions#create). You can add **View** and **Edit** capabilities to any role for the following:

* [Monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors)
* [Monitor scripts](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-synthetics-api-tests)
* [Private locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations)
* [Monitor downtimes](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times)
* [Secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/secure-credentials-store-credentials-information-scripted-browsers)
