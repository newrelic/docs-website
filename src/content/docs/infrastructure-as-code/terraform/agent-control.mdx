[New Relic Agent Control](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview) with Terraform makes the large-scale monitoring with New Relic even easier, especially when dealing with multiple Kubernetes clusters. With Terraform and Helm, you can set up New Relic Agent Control in a specified, repeatable, and scalable way across your entire Kubernetes infrastructure. 

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]
Before using this integration in Terraform, ensure you have the following:

- **Helm 3:** Helm version 3 must be installed on your machine. For installation instructions, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).
- **New Relic license key:** You'll need a New Relic license key to report telemetry to your New Relic account.
- **New Relic user key:** You'll need your [New Relic user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) if you haven't already pulled your `clientID` key and secret.
- **User permissions:** Your New Relic user has the auth domain manager and org product admin roles.
- **New Relic OrgId:** The New Relic `OrgId` will identify which organization you are getting your client ID key and secret from.
- **Kubernetes cluster name:** Have the name of your Kubernetes cluster ready, as it will be referenced during the installation process.
<Callout variant="tip">
  When setting up a new cluster with Terraform, make sure to use the same cluster name during the installation of agent control.
</Callout>
- **Helm provider for Terraform:** Include the [Helm provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs) in your Terraform script for the installation to work.
- **Terraform:** Make sure you have [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) installed on your machine.

## Compatibility [#compatibility]

To find out which Kubernetes versions are compatible with this solution, refer to the [compatibility](/docs/new-relic-control/agent-control/overview/#compatibility) section in the overview.

## Install [#installation]

If you don't have your `clientId` and `clientSecret`, fetch them using the following [NerdGraph](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) API: 

```sh
  curl -X POST \
      https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'x-api-key: [INSERT_USER_API_KEY]' \
      --data-raw '{"query": "mutation SICreate { systemIdentityCreate(name: \"User Key for Agent Control\" organizationId: \"[INSERT_YOUR_ORG_ID]\") { clientId clientSecret } }"}' \
      --compressed
```

In the command, replace the placeholder values with your `organizationId` and user key. This returns the required credentials that you'll use in your configuration file.

### Step 1

Create a directory for your project and place your `main.tf` file inside it. Confirm that you have added the [Helm provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs) to your Terraform file.

### Step 2

Configure your Terraform script with a Helm release that uses New Relic's charts for Agent Control. See the sample script below:

```hcl
provider "helm" {
 kubernetes {
   config_paths = [
       "~/.kube/config"
   ]
 }
}


resource "helm_release" "newrelic" {
   name = "agent-control"
   repository = "https://newrelic.github.io/helm-charts/"
   chart = "agent-control"
   namespace = "newrelic"
   create_namespace = "true"


   values = [
       file("./values-newrelic.yaml")
   ]
}
```

Note that the Terraform script references a `values-newrelic.yaml` file. This is the New Relic Agent Control configuration file that will be used for setting up Agent Control. It does not need to be in the same directory as the Terraform script. You can reference it from any location by providing the correct path in the `file()` function within the values attribute of the `helm_release` resource.

Or, if you place the `values-newrelic.yaml` file directly in the Terraform project directory, the `main.tf` script will automatically reference it.

Here is an example of a basic `values-newrelic.yaml` file with no additional configuration included:

```yaml
global:
 cluster: [YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME]
 licenseKey: [YOUR_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY]


agent-control-deployment:
 identityClientId: [YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID]
 identityClientSecret: [YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET]
 config:
   fleet_control:
   # optional
     fleet_id: [YOUR_FLEET_ENTITY_GUID]
     auth:
       organizationId: [ORG_ID]
   agentControl:
     content:
       log:
         level: trace
```

To explore all available configuration settings, refer to [`values-newrelic.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/agent-control/values.yaml).


### Step 3

Initialize and review the Terraform script:

  ```shell
      terraform init
  ```

  ```shell
      terraform plan
  ```

### Step 4

Apply your changes:

  ```shell
      terraform apply
  ```

### Step 5

Check to make sure the agent pods get built out correctly using Kube Control:

  ```shell
      kubectl get pods -n newrelic
  ```

## Configuration [#configuration]

In `values-newrelic.yaml`, you can configure the installation of multiple monitoring agents. This example shows the options available, including New Relic's infrastructure agent, Fluent Bit logs agent, OpenTelemetry collector agent, and [New Relic Pipeline Control](/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/overview) gateway agent:

```yaml
agent-control-deployment:
  identityClientId: [YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID]
  identityClientSecret: [YOUR_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET]
  config:
    subAgents:
      infrastructure:
        type: newrelic/com.newrelic.infrastructure:0.1.0
        content:
          chart_version: "*"  
          chart_values:
            newrelic-infrastructure:
              enableProcessMetrics: true
      logs:
        type: newrelic/io.fluentbit:0.1.0
        content:
          # Ref: `https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging`
          # Recommended: check and define an explicit chart version (latest stable)
          chart_version: "*"
            chart_values:
              newrelic-logging:
                sendMetrics: true
      agent-operator:
        type: com.newrelic.k8s_agent_operator:0.1.0
        content:
          chart_version: "*"
      open-telemetry:
        type: newrelic/io.opentelemetry.collector:0.1.0
        content:
            # Ref: `https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector/values.yaml`
            # Recommended: check and define an explicit chart version (latest stable)
            chart_version: "*"
              chart_values:
                nr-k8s-otel-collector:
                  receivers.filelog.enabled: false
      gateway:
        type: newrelic/com.newrelic.pipeline_control_gateway:0.1.0

          chart_values:
            gateway:
              autoscaling:
                minReplicas: 2
                maxReplicas: 10
                targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
```

## Uninstall [#uninstall]

<Callout variant="important">
    Removing a Helm release resource from your Terraform configuration is a destructive action. After you run `terraform apply` following this change, Terraform will uninstall and destroy the related resources in your Kubernetes cluster. This can result in the loss of data and configurations tied to the resources managed by that Helm release. Before proceeding, make sure you fully understand the potential impact on your environment:
    - Review all dependencies and services that might be affected.
    - Consider backing up any persistent data or configurations linked to the release.
    - Confirm that removing this release is necessary and fits your infrastructure management strategy.
    Always exercise caution when making significant changes to your infrastructure, and ensure you have proper rollback procedures in place in case something goes wrong.
</Callout>

- Run `terraform plan`: After removing the Helm release resource block from your configuration, run the `terraform plan` command. This allows you to review the changes Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. Carefully examine the plan output to ensure that only the intended resources are marked for deletion. This step is essential to verify that no unintended deletions or changes will occur.
- Run `terraform apply`: If the terraform plan results align with your expectations, proceed by running the `terraform apply` command. This will implement the planned changes, effectively removing the specified Helm release from your environment. Confirm the execution when prompted to complete the uninstallation process.
