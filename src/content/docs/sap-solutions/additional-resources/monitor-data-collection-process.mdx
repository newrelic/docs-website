## Runtime status and transmission log

From the **Data Provider Registry** (transaction `/NEWR/REGISTRY`), you can check the <img src="/images/runtimestatus.webp" class="inline" style={{height: "40px", width: "120px"}} alt="RuntimeStatus icon" title="RuntimeStatus" /> and <img src="/images/transmissionlog.webp" class="inline" style={{height: "40px", width: "120px"}} alt="transmissionlog" title="Transmissionlog.webp" /> for each data provider. The transmission log shows the status and time of each transmission.

## Check job status and spool

1. Use transaction `SM37` to check the status of scheduled jobs. Enter `/NEWR/*` in the **ABAP Program Name** field and click **Execute**.
2. Pay attention to the execution duration; an abnormally long time indicates a potential problem.
3. Check for overlapping jobs and adjust the schedule as needed. The job spool provides the outcome for each data provider.

## Check application log

Data collection processes are logged in the application log (transaction SLG1). Query with the Application Log Object `/NEWR/DP`.

## SAP data collection monitoring dashboard

Data collection metrics are also sent to New Relic for self-monitoring. Use the out-of-the-box [**SAP Data Collection Monitoring**]() dashboard to monitor the data collection processes for each data provider.
