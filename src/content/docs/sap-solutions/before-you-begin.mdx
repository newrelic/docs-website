Before you start using New Relic Monitoring for your SAP solutions, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

  - **New Relic Account ID**: Obtain your [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id) to identify your New Relic account.
  - **License Key**: Secure a New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> needed for authentication and data access.
  - **Data Center Region**: [Decide on your preferred data center location (US or EU)](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/) and configure your account accordingly.
  - **SAP System Requirements**: Confirm that your SAP systems meet the required software component release levels specified by New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions. For details on available data providers by system type, see the [Data Providers Reference](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/data-providers-reference).
  - **Monitoring BTP Accounts**: If monitoring BTP accounts, ensure one of the following:
    - CloudALM account configured for BTP monitoring
    - Process Integration Runtime service subscription (required for integration monitoring)

    <Callout variant="important">
        You may need approval or configuration assistance from your security or network teams. Complete these steps before installation and review the [Checklist for installation readiness](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/pre-installation-checklist/#checklist-for-installation-readiness).

## Monitored systems [#monitored-systems]

Our agentless architecture uses **RFC connections** to retrieve data. To ensure secure connections, you must create an SAP system user with a specific authorization profile for these connections.

- Verify the required software versions:
    - SAP_BASIS: Release 740 or above
    - Kernel: Release 753 Patch 602 or above
    - ST-PI: Release 740 SP 16 or above
- [Upload the authorization role](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#upload-authorization-role) `NEWR_DATA_PROVIDER`.
- [Create a system user](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#create-rfc-user-id) with the uploaded role for RFC connections.
- If you're monitoring a **HANA database**, create a **HANA database user NRAGENT** with **Catalog Read** and **Monitoring** access using the following SQL commands:

        ```sql
          CREATE ROLE NR_AGENT_ROLE;
          GRANT CATALOG READ TO NR_AGENT_ROLE;
          GRANT MONITORING TO NR_AGENT_ROLE;
        ```

        ```sql
          CREATE USER NRAGENT PASSWORD 'Xxxxxxxx' NO FORCE_FIRST_PASSWORD_CHANGE;
          GRANT NR_AGENT_ROLE TO NRAGENT;
        ```

- Collect the **HANA server host** and **tenant DB port** for SQL connection.
- For other databases, activate the standard **CCMS database KPIs** by running the ABAP program `RSDBKPIMON`. 

## Central monitoring system [#central-monitoring-system]

On the central monitoring system, confirm the following component versions are installed. For versions not listed, contact your New Relic Account Executive for a supplementary package.

- Adjust proxy server policies for accessing New Relic if required. Ensure proxy settings are configured:
  - Server domain name/IP address and port.
  - Proxy access credentials, if authentication is necessary.

- Modify firewall policies to allow HTTPS traffic to New Relic if blocked.
    <Callout variant="tip">
      These connections can be set in the **Central Monitoring System** using **SAP Transaction SM59** and tested. Refer to the [Set HTTP Destination to New Relic Cloud](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#set-http-destination-to-new-relic-cloud) for more details.
    </Callout>

- For each monitored system specified, use transaction `SM59` and the remote system ID to create **RFC Destination** and test connections. Refer to the [Create RFC destinations for monitored systems](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#create-rfc-for-monitored-systems) for more details.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Ensure the RFC user has the `/NEWR/DATA_PROVIDER` role assigned.
    </Callout>

- Ensure the following for monitoring remote HANA databases:
  - The central monitoring system should have access to the HANA Server and tenant DB port.
  - If your central monitoring system is not an `S4HANA` system, ensure one of the following components is installed:
    - HANA Client v2.0 (version needs to be compatible with the HANA DB)
    - HANA Client Lib file:
        - `libSQLDBCHDB.so` (Linux)
        - `libSQLDBCHDB.dll` (Windows)
        - The library should be located in the SAP Kernel folder and owned by the SID Admin ID (e.g., sd1adm).
  - For each remote HANA database, use transaction `SAP DBACOCKPIT` to create a DB Connection. Refer to [Create DB connection](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#create-database-connection) for details.

## Monitor BTP account

To monitor a BTP account, you need either a CloudALM instance set up to monitor the BTP account, or a subscription to the Process Integration Runtime service (applicable only to integration monitoring). Service keys are required for connection authentication. For more information, see [How to retrieve the service keys](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/obtain-service-key/process-integration-runtime).

Service keys are also used to create [External HTTP destinations](/docs/sap-solutions/additional-resources/additional-configuration/#create-authentication-endpoint) and serve as the API host for API data providers.
