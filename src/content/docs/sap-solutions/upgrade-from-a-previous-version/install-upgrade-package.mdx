## Backup and update configuration

  <Callout variant="tip">
     Save any modified data provider configurations or custom data providers to a configuration template to prevent overwriting during the upgrade. Ensure that the templates are saved before copying the new template from client 000, even if the V3.0 ABAP Add-on is not installed.
  </Callout>
