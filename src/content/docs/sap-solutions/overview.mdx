New Relic monitoring for SAP solutions (NRM4SAP) is an intelligent observability product that provides a *single pane of glass* view into your entire digital landscape, including SAP and non-SAP systems. Its agentless architecture gives you complete visibility into critical SAP systems like **S/4HANA**, **ECC**, **RISE**, **BTP**, and **FIORI**.

## Key Capabilities

### Agentless architecture

NRM4SAP's industry-unique, agentless architecture is fast, lightweight, and native to SAP. The SAP-certified add-on is installed on a central SAP server, which connects to other systems using secure RFC connections. This design minimizes the risk of exposing your data and simplifies installation to just one step.

### Comprehensive data collection

NRM4SAP collects telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces, or M.E.L.T) from across your SAP ecosystem. This includes performance data, business process metrics, and transactions. By providing an end-to-end observability view, it helps reduce the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) issues.

### Multi-layered observability

NRM4SAP provides comprehensive coverage from the business application layer down to the backend database. This tiered approach allows you to focus on different aspects of your systems and business processes.

- **End-to-end**: Provides automated baselining and alerting for business KPIs and process bottlenecks across systems like PI/PO, APIs, and BTP.
- **Business Processes**: Offers a real-time, end-to-end view of critical business processes such as Order to Cash and Procure-to-Pay.

The bottom three layers in the diagram below represent standard out-of-the-box capabilities:

- **Infra and cloud**: Includes standard out-of-the-box monitoring for SIDs, application server instances, databases, and hosts. This layer features an agentless, Basis-friendly, and SAP-certified ABAP add-on.
- **Applications**: Provides visibility into processes and transactions across SAP ABAP, SAP Java, and non-SAP systems. This includes transactions, IDOCs, RFCs, queues, and background jobs.
- **Experience**: Enables you to drill down into application and technical layers like Fiori and BTP to quickly identify root causes using distributed traces.
