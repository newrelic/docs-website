New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions captures SAP telemetry data—Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces (M.E.L.T)—and sends it to the New Relic One Platform for analysis and visualization.

## Central Monitoring System vs. Monitored Systems

SAP systems that provide telemetry data are known as Monitored Systems. The Central System is the SAP system where NRM4SAP is installed; it collects, transforms, and transmits telemetry data. Typically, you install NRM4SAP on a single SAP system, such as SAP Solution Manager (SolMon). It utilizes standard SAP data sources like ST_PI, CCMS, and the performance database, removing the need for additional agent installations on monitored systems.

## Data Flow Architecture

Data is efficiently managed by using RFC calls to pull SAP telemetry data into the Central System. The data is then processed through the ABAP Enterprise Connector and securely transmitted to the New Relic One TDP Platform via HTTPS.

This architecture ensures streamlined data handling and enhances visibility into SAP system performance, providing engineers with critical insights for effective monitoring and management.
