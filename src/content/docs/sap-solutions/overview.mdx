New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions (NRM4SAP) delivers intelligent observability with a single pane of glass view across your entire digital landscape, including both SAP and non-SAP systems. Its unique, agentless architecture offers complete visibility into critical SAP systems such as **S/4HANA**, **ECC**, **RISE**, **BTP**, and **FIORI**.

## Key capabilities

### Agentless architecture

NRM4SAP features an industry-leading, agentless architecture that's fast, lightweight, and native to SAP. Installed as a SAP-certified add-on on a central SAP server, it connects securely to other systems via RFC connections. This architecture minimizes data exposure risks and simplifies installation to a single step.

### Comprehensive data collection

NRM4SAP gathers telemetry data—metrics, events, logs, and traces (M.E.L.T)—from across your SAP ecosystem. It captures performance data, business process metrics, and transactions, providing an end-to-end observability view to reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) issues.

### Multi-layered observability

NRM4SAP covers multiple layers from the business application down to the backend database, allowing focused insights into various aspects of your systems and processes.

- **End-to-end**: Offers automated baselining and alerting for business KPIs and process bottlenecks across systems like PI/PO, APIs, and BTP.
- **Business processes**: Provides real-time, end-to-end visibility of critical processes such as Order to Cash and Procure-to-Pay.
- **Infrastructure and cloud**: Features standard monitoring for SIDs, application server instances, databases, and hosts, with an agentless, basis-friendly SAP-certified ABAP add-on.
- **Applications**: Ensures visibility into processes and transactions across SAP ABAP, SAP Java, and non-SAP systems, including transactions, IDOCs, RFCs, queues, and background jobs.
- **Experience**: Allows drill-down into application and technical layers like Fiori and BTP, quickly identifying root causes using distributed traces.

## Usecase

SAP systems are vital for large enterprises, serving as the backbone for core business processes such as financials, logistics, material management, warehousing, sales, and distribution. As an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, SAP is the preferred choice for many large corporations, making SAP monitoring essential for maintaining operational observability in these environments. Large enterprises require this integration to ensure seamless operation of their backend systems, such as order processing, production management, and logistics, which are all handled by SAP. Integrating SAP monitoring is a crucial point for sales interactions with large companies, as it enables comprehensive oversight of business processes.

### Integration and Issue Resolution

Monitoring SAP systems within an organization's infrastructure is non-negotiable, as SAP supports essential business operations. It functions as the backbone that manages everything from e-commerce order processing to warehouse organization. Therefore, comprehensive SAP monitoring is indispensable for maintaining the health and performance of business processes.

### Post-Installation and Next Steps

Upon completing the installation, customers gain immediate access to out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts. These tools are ready to use from day one, providing the following benefits:

- **Management insight**: Management gains centralized visibility into the health and performance of their SAP systems integrated with other IT systems, reducing reliance on SAP admins for updates.

- **Custom monitoring capabilities**: Customers can address specific use cases by monitoring particular business processes or integrations, such as e-commerce order processing. With the data collected, they can develop custom dashboards and visualizations.

- **Expanded alerting options**: By adding crucial alerts, administrators can be promptly notified of service interruptions, ensuring timely responses to maintain service continuity.

This integration supports businesses in optimizing their operations and enhances the visibility and management capabilities of their SAP systems.
