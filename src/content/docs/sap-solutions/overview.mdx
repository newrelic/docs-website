New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions captures SAP telemetry data—Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces (M.E.L.T)—and sends it to the New Relic One Platform for analysis and visualization.

## Central Monitoring System vs. Monitored Systems

SAP systems that provide telemetry data are known as Monitored Systems. The Central System is the SAP system where NRM4SAP is installed; it collects, transforms, and transmits telemetry data. Install NRM4SAP on a single SAP system (typically SAP Solution Manager, also known as SolMon). It utilizes standard SAP data sources like ST_PI, CCMS, and the performance database, removing the need for additional agent installations on monitored systems.

## Data Flow Architecture

Data is efficiently managed by using RFC calls to pull SAP telemetry data into the Central System. The data is then processed through the ABAP Enterprise Connector and securely transmitted to the New Relic One TDP Platform via HTTPS.

This architecture ensures streamlined data handling and enhances visibility into SAP system performance, providing engineers with critical insights for effective monitoring and management.

## Use cases

SAP systems are vital for large enterprises, serving as the backbone for essential business processes including financials, logistics, material management, warehousing, sales, and distribution. Utilizing New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions (NRM4SAP), enterprises can achieve comprehensive visibility into these SAP-driven operations to ensure they function seamlessly.

### Integration and issue resolution

Integrating NRM4SAP into an organization's infrastructure is crucial for monitoring SAP systems that support key business operations like e-commerce order processing and warehouse management. This integration offers the following:

**Comprehensive Monitoring**: NRM4SAP provides robust observability, ensuring SAP systems operate efficiently and facilitating the detection and resolution of potential issues before they impact business processes.

### Post-installation and next steps

After installation, customers can immediately leverage out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts provided by NRM4SAP, yielding several advantages:

- **Enhanced Management Insight**: Centralized dashboards offer visibility into the health and performance of SAP systems alongside other IT systems, streamlining management oversight and reducing reliance on administrative checks.

- **Custom Monitoring Opportunities**: Customers can tailor monitoring to specific business needs, such as tracking integration points within order processing workflows. Custom dashboards and visualizations can be developed using collected telemetry data.

- **Proactive Alerting**: By setting crucial alerts, administrators can be immediately warned of service disruptions, enabling them to maintain continuity and promptly address any issues.

NRM4SAP empowers businesses to optimize their SAP operations, enhancing visibility and facilitating effective management of their SAP ecosystem.
