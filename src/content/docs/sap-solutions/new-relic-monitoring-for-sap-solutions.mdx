New Relic monitoring for SAP solutions (NRM4SAP) is an intelligent observability product. It connects legacy and AI-powered cloud SAP solutions for complete visibility. Its agentless architecture collects, transforms, and provides out-of-the-box centralized dashboards for telemetry data from SAP systems such as **S/4HANA**, **ECC**, **RISE**, **BTP**, and **FIORI**.

  NRM4SAP provides a single "pane of glass" view not only for different SAP systems but also for non-SAP systems across the entire digital landscape. Highly informative out-of-the-box dashboards and AI-enabled automated alerting mechanisms help reduce the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).

NRM4SAP offers comprehensive coverage from the business application layer through the front end to the backend database layer. The top two layers are advanced and can be enabled through quick and easy configurations. They focus on end-to-end alerting across different systems and monitoring business processes:

- **End-to-End**: Provides automated baselining and alerting of business KPIs and process bottlenecks across systems like PI/PO, APIs, Java, web services, and BTP.

- **Business Processes**: Offers a real-time, end-to-end view of critical business processes such as Order to Cash, Procure-to-Pay, supply chain, Plan to Produce, warehousing, finance, HR, and payroll.

The bottom three layers in the diagram below represent standard out-of-the-box capabilities:

- **Infra and Cloud**: Includes SIDs, application server instances, databases, hosts, HTTP servers, and logs. This layer features agentless, Basis-friendly, SAP-certified ABAP instrumentation.

- **Applications**: Provides visibility into processes and transactions across SAP ABAP, SAP Java, and non-SAP systems. Examples include transactions, IDOCs, RFCs, queues, background jobs, programs, traces, and transports.

- **Experience**: Enables drill-down into application and technical layers like Fiori and BTP apps to quickly identify and resolve root causes using distributed traces. This is achieved with New Relic's browser and Java agents.
