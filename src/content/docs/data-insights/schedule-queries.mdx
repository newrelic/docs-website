As a New Relic user, you may find yourself repeatedly running the same log queries to monitor critical information, track trends, or identify recurring issues. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to oversight, hindering proactive problem resolution and operational efficiency.

Schedule queries solves this problem by automating your NRQL queries directly from the logs UI. You can define recurring schedules, specify output formats, and deliver results to email destinations, so you'll receive timely updates without manual intervention.

<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## What you can do

With schedule queries, you can:

- **Automate recurring queries**: Set up log queries to run automatically on hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedules.
- **Receive formatted results**: Get query results delivered as CSV or JSON attachments via email.
- **Set conditional delivery**: Choose to receive notifications every time a query runs or only when results are found.
- **Manage multiple schedules**: Create, edit, delete, and monitor all your scheduled queries from a centralized management interface.
- **Use flexible query options**: While accessed from the logs UI, you can schedule any NRQL query across different data types.

## Pricing

**Schedule queries** is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when scheduled queries are executed.

## Prerequisites

To use schedule queries, you need:

- A New Relic account with [Workflow Automation capabilities](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows)
- Pro or Enterprise [pricing tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/) (not available on Free or Basic plans)
- Appropriate permissions to create and manage workflow automations

## Access schedule queries

You can create scheduled queries directly from the logs UI:

<Steps>
<Step>
Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/logs)**.
</Step>
<Step>
Create or modify your NRQL query in the logs interface.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Schedule search** option from either:
   - The three-dot menu in the query bar
   - The clock icon in the logs interface
</Step>
</Steps>

## Create a scheduled query

<Steps>
<Step>

### Define your query

When you initiate the scheduling workflow, your current NRQL query is automatically pre-populated. You can:

- Edit the query as needed
- Use autocomplete functionality for query building
- Preview results by running the query to validate it works correctly
- Use any NRQL query (not limited to log data)

**Name your scheduled query** with a descriptive title for easy identification.

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure notifications

Set up how you want to receive results:

**Choose a destination:**
- Select an existing email destination from your alerts configuration
- Or add a new destination by entering email addresses

**Customize the email:**
- **Subject**: Defaults to your search name plus the date
- **Body**: Add custom text and use variables like `{{Search_name}}`

**Select output format:**
- **CSV**: Results delivered as a CSV attachment
- **JSON**: Results delivered as a JSON attachment
- **Search link**: Include a permalink back to the exact query in New Relic

</Step>
<Step>

### Set your schedule

Choose from scheduling options:

<Tabs>
  <TabsBar>
    <TabsBarItem id="simple">Simple schedules</TabsBarItem>
    <TabsBarItem id="cron">Cron expressions</TabsBarItem>
  </TabsBar>
  <TabsPages>
    <TabsPageItem id="simple">
    **Simple scheduling options:**
    - **Hourly**: Runs every hour from your specified start time
    - **Daily**: Runs every day at your specified time
    - **Weekly**: Runs weekly on your chosen day and time
    - **Monthly**: Runs monthly on your specified date and time

    For each option, set:
    - Start time and date
    - Time zone (uses your New Relic account timezone by default)
    </TabsPageItem>
    <TabsPageItem id="cron">
    **Custom cron expressions:**

    For advanced scheduling, use cron format with five fields:
    ```
    * * * * *
    │ │ │ │ │
    │ │ │ │ └── Day of week (0-7, Sunday = 0 or 7)
    │ │ │ └──── Month (1-12)
    │ │ └────── Day of month (1-31)
    │ └──────── Hour (0-23)
    └────────── Minute (0-59)
    ```

    Examples:
    - `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9:00 AM
    - `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9:00 AM
    - `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes

    The interface shows your cron expression in plain English for validation.
    </TabsPageItem>
  </TabsPages>
</Tabs>

**Set delivery conditions:**
- **Send every time**: Receive notifications regardless of results
- **Send only when results found**: Only get notifications when the query returns data (results > 0)

</Step>
<Step>

### Review and create

Review all your configuration details including:
- Query and schedule settings
- Email subject, body, and output format
- Delivery conditions

Click **Create scheduled search** to activate your automation.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Manage scheduled queries

Access your scheduled queries management interface at **[one.newrelic.com > Administration > Scheduled searches](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal)**. From here you can:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="view-schedules" title="View all scheduled queries">

The management interface displays:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>**Column**</th>
      <th>**Description**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>The descriptive name you gave your scheduled query</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Additional details about the query purpose</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Destination type</td>
      <td>Shows "Email" for current deliveries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Schedule</td>
      <td>Frequency and timing of the query execution</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Shows "Scheduled" for active queries or "Draft" for incomplete setups</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Last run</td>
      <td>Timestamp of the most recent execution</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

</Collapser>

<Collapser id="edit-schedules" title="Edit scheduled queries">

To modify an existing scheduled query:

1. Click the **Edit** option for your desired query
2. Update any configuration including:
   - Query name and NRQL
   - Schedule frequency and timing
   - Email destinations and formatting
   - Delivery conditions
3. Save your changes

**Note**: If you originally created a schedule using simple options (like "Daily"), and you edit it, the interface will maintain that simple format rather than converting to cron expressions.

</Collapser>

<Collapser id="manage-schedules" title="Other management actions">

**Duplicate a schedule**: Copy an existing configuration to create similar scheduled queries quickly.

**Run immediately**: Trigger a scheduled query to execute right away, outside its regular schedule.

**Pause/Enable**: Temporarily stop a scheduled query without deleting the configuration. You can re-enable paused queries anytime.

**Delete**: Permanently remove a scheduled query you no longer need.
