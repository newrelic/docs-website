As a New Relic user, you may find yourself repeatedly running the same log queries to monitor systems, track trends, or identify recurring issues. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to oversight, especially when you need to check critical information regularly. Without automated, recurring queries, you risk missing critical events or experiencing delays in obtaining important information.

Schedule NRQL queries solves this problem by letting you automate any NRQL query on a recurring schedule and deliver results to your email. You can set up queries to run hourly, daily, weekly, or on custom schedules, so you'll receive timely updates on critical data without manual intervention.

<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!
  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## What you can do

With scheduled NRQL queries, you can:

* **Automate routine monitoring**: Set up recurring queries to monitor log patterns, system performance, or any data in New Relic.
* **Schedule any NRQL query**: While you create schedules from the logs UI, you can schedule queries for logs, metrics, events, or any data type using NRQL.
* **Choose flexible schedules**: Set queries to run using cron expressions for maximum flexibility.
* **Receive results via email**: Get query results delivered as CSV attachments or JSON format.
* **Manage all schedules centrally**: View, edit, delete, pause, and manually trigger all your scheduled queries from the administration UI.
* **Set delivery conditions**: Choose to receive emails every time a query runs or only when results are found.

## Pricing

**Schedule NRQL queries** is an Advanced Compute Product feature offered as an [add-on](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/add-on-billing) or as a part of the Compute pricing model. Advanced [CCUs](/docs/licenses/license-information/product-definitions/new-relic-one-pricing-definitions/#compute-capacity-unit) are consumed when scheduled queries execute and process results.

## Prerequisites

Before you can schedule NRQL queries, make sure you have:

* **Workflow automation capabilities**: You need permissions to create and manage workflow automations, which power scheduled queries.
* **Account access**: You must have access to the New Relic account where you want to schedule queries.
* **Data access**: You need permissions to query the specific data types (logs, metrics, events) that your scheduled query will access.

## Access scheduled queries

You can access scheduled queries in two ways:

1. **From logs UI**: When viewing log data, click the three-dot menu or clock icon to schedule your current query.
2. **From administration**: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Administration > Scheduled searches](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/scheduled-searches/list)** to manage all your scheduled queries.

## Create a scheduled query

### From the logs UI

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/logs)**.
2. Create or refine your NRQL query in the logs interface.
3. Click the three-dot menu or clock icon, then select **Schedule search**.
4. Follow the configuration steps below.

### From the administration UI

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Administration > Scheduled searches](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/scheduled-searches/list)**.
2. Click **Schedule search**.
3. Follow the configuration steps below.

### Configure your scheduled query

#### Step 1: Define your query

1. **Name your search**: Enter a descriptive name for your scheduled query.
2. **Write your NRQL query**:
   * If you came from the logs UI, your query is pre-populated
   * You can edit the query or write a completely new one
   * The query can target any data type (logs, metrics, events, custom data)
   * Use the same autocomplete functionality available in other query interfaces
3. **Test your query**: Click **Run query** to preview results and validate that your query works correctly.

#### Step 2: Set up notifications

1. **Choose a destination**:
   * **Select existing destination**: Choose from email destinations you've already set up for alerts
   * **Add new destination**: Enter one or more email addresses to receive results

2. **Customize the email**:
   * **Subject**: Default is your search name plus the date, but you can customize it
   * **Body**: Add custom text and variables like `{{Search_name}}`

3. **Choose what to include**:
   * **CSV**: Receive query results as a CSV attachment (available in preview)
   * **JSON**: Receive results in JSON format (available in preview)
   * **Search link**: Include a permalink back to the exact query in New Relic (planned for GA)
   * **Inline table**: View results directly in the email (planned for GA)

#### Step 3: Configure schedule

1. **Choose schedule type**: Currently, only **Cron expression** is available (hourly, daily, and weekly options coming soon).

2. **Set your cron expression**:
   * Enter a cron expression using the standard format: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`
   * Below your expression, you'll see a plain English translation (for example, "Every Sunday at 9:00 PM")

3. **Set delivery conditions**:
   * **Send every time**: Receive an email each time the query runs, regardless of results
   * **Send only when results found**: Only receive emails when your query returns data

4. **Review and create**: Review all your settings and click **Create scheduled search**.

## Manage scheduled queries

Access your scheduled queries management page at **[one.newrelic.com > Administration > Scheduled searches](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/scheduled-searches/list)**.

From this page, you can:

* **View all searches**: See a list of all your scheduled queries with details like name, schedule, destination, and last run time.
* **Edit searches**: Click **Edit** to modify any aspect of a scheduled query.
* **Delete searches**: Permanently remove scheduled queries you no longer need.
* **Duplicate searches**: Create copies of existing searches to use as templates.
* **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily disable a scheduled query without deleting it.
* **Manual trigger**: Run a scheduled query immediately outside of its regular schedule.
