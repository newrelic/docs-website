## New Relic Teams

New Relic Teams lets you connect the entities you're monitoring to the Teams who own them. When you can easily see who owns an entity, you can speed up troubleshooting, enhance team collaboration, and improve your operational efficiency.

By assigning the different parts of your system to the teams who maintain them, you can find the right team for any service, host, or other entity.

## How can you use Teams across New Relic?

You can leverage New Relic Teams in a variety of places across the platform. This means Teams is available when you need it to contact owners of specific entities. Here are some examples of how you can leverage the power of Teams:

<Collapser
        id="incidents"
        title="During an incident"
      >

When you're looking at the Issues page in Alerts > Issues and Activity, you can find the Team information in the Impacted entities section.
</Collapser>

<Collapser
        id="platform"
        title="While navigating the platform"
      >

You can always find the team ownership information in the header of an entity page.
</Collapser>
