This API deletes all the workflow definition versions with the specified name.

In order to delete a definition, there must be no schedules using the definition. If the definition is currently used by a schedule, deleting the definition will fail and return an error accordingly.

All running workflow runs will continue to completion even if the definition is deleted.

## Example

```graphql
  mutation {
    workflowAutomationDeleteWorkflowDefinition(
      definition: {name: "my-workflow"}
      scope: {id: "12345678", type: ACCOUNT}
    ) {
      definition {
        name
      }
    }
  }
```
