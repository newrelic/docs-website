This API gets and returns a list of all workflow definition outlines under the given scope. Note, the inner workflow definition yaml is not available with this query. A workflow definition yaml is only returned using a GetWorkflowDefinition query `/{actor/account(:id)/workflowAutomation/workflow(:name, :version)`

## Example

```graphql
{
  actor {
    account(id: 11933347) {
      workflowAutomation {
        workflows(cursor: "xyz123") {
          results {
            definition {
              name
              scope {
                id
                type
              }
              version
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
