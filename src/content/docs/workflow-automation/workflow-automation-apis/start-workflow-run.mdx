This API starts a workflow run for a specified workflow definition.

Number of concurrent workflow runs, and number of steps executed in a given run is defined at [Workflow System Limits](/docs/workflow-automation/limitations-and-faq/workflow-limits).

## Example

Use the [Query Builder](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql?state=b8f3b3a9-8d3e-c03e-5da4-34b98a57ff8f) to create and edit a workflow. See [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer).


```graphql
mutation {
  workflowAutomationStartWorkflowRun(
    scope: {id: "12345678", type: ACCOUNT}
    definition: {name: "my-workflow"}
    workflowInputs: [
      {key: "foo", value: "bar"},
      {key: "fruit", value: "apple"}
      ]
    options: {logLevel: DEBUG}
  ) {
    runId
  }
}
```

## logLevel option

The `logLevel` option controls the amount of logging information generated during workflow execution.

**Available values:**
- `NONE` (default): No log outputs will be generated.
- `INFO`: Outputs step level information.
- `DEBUG`: Adds attribute to the step started logs with all the action step inputs.
