This API triggers a signal to an existing running workflow. This can be used to send callback and be evaluated by the workflow to go to different next steps.

Parameters can be passed it along with the signal.

## Example [#example]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title="Given the workflow definition below and a workflow already running">
    ```yaml
      name: signalDemo

      steps:
        - name: waitStep
          type: wait
          seconds: 300
          signals:
            - name: approve
              next: signalHandler
            - name: cancel
              next: signalHandler

        - name: NoSignalReceived
          type: action
          action: newrelic.ingest.sendLogs
          version: 1
          inputs:
            logs:
              - message: "no signals received"
          next: end

        - name: signalHandler
          type: action
          action: newrelic.ingest.sendLogs
          version: 1
          inputs:
            logs:
              - message: "signal '${{ .steps.waitStep.outputs.signalName }}' was received with: '${{ .steps.waitStep.outputs.signalInputs | tostring }}'"
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

After starting this workflow, this runId is returned upon start `107e6df2-aa17-41bc-8065-bfa46bde810b`

The workflow can then be signaled with this mutation

```graphql
mutation {
  workflowAutomationSignalWorkflowRun(
    accountId: 11933347
    runId: "107e6df2-aa17-41bc-8065-bfa46bde810b"
    signalName: "approve"
    signalInputs: [
      {key: "foo", value: "bar"}
    ]
  ) {
    runId
  }
}
```

The following can be observed in the Logs if the workflow was started with the `options: {logLevel: DEBUG}`
