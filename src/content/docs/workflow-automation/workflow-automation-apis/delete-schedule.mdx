Deletes the schedule of a workflow definition. Note, this doesn’t stop any currently executing workflow run (use the StopWorkflowRun mutation).

## Example [#example]

Use the [Query Builder](https://one.newrelic.com/nerdgraph-graphiql?state=fc314f67-101e-a54a-169a-191d1fd41fd) to create and edit a workflow. See [NerdGraph API explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer).

  ```graphql
      mutation {
        workflowAutomationDeleteSchedule(
          accountId: 11933347
          schedule: {id: "1a71d299-82c2-4b4d-9803-b14523e3a9e7"}
        ) {
          scheduleId
        }
      }
  ```

### Error Example

In case the `schedule.id` is not found, the following structure is returned.

  ```graphql
    {
        "data": {
            "workflowAutomationDeleteSchedule": null
        },
        "errors": [{
            "message": "Could not find schedule with ID MTE2NDk5MDB8TkdFUHxXT1JLRkxPV19TQ0hFRFVMRXwwMTk5MGUzYi04NzAyLTc2M2QtOWUzMy01ZTU1ZThmZTYzYjkl",
            "path": ["workflowAutomationDeleteSchedule"]
        }]
    }
  ```
