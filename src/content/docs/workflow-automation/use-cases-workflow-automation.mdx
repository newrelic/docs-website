Get more out of Workflow Automation by exploring practical use cases that demonstrate how to automate tasks and processes effectively. These examples illustrate how Workflow Automation can enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and improve incident response times.

## Automate AWS lambda function rollback

You can automate the rollback of AWS lambda function deployments to ensure service continuity and minimize downtime. If you're a DevOps engineer managing the `node-lambda` REST API demo application, you need to address failures swiftly in AWS Lambda functions that disrupt critical endpoints like `base_url/inventory/2`. This automation process immediately rolls back the function to a stable version upon detection of a failure.

When New Relic detects a failure in the `node-lambda` function via an alert, it activates a predefined workflow. This workflow automatically reverts the Lambda function to a previous stable version without manual input. Notifications are then communicated to the team via platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.

To set up this automation:

- Set up a synthetic monitor in New Relic that consistently assesses the health of the `base_url/inventory/2` endpoint.
- [Configure New Relic alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) that trigger the rollback workflow upon detecting failures.
- Develop an automated workflow that:
  - Responds to alerts using AWS SDK or CLI to perform rollbacks utilizing Lambda versions and aliases.
  - Sends notifications to team communication channels.
- Ensure appropriate IAM permissions are configured to facilitate interaction with AWS Lambda.

## Automate EC2 instance CPU alert response

Automating responses to high CPU usage alerts on AWS EC2 instances ensures consistent application performance with minimum manual intervention. When CPU usage surpasses 40% for more than five minutes, rapid action is needed to prevent application performance issues. This automation process alerts a designated Slack channel about high CPU usage and requests approval to resize the instance, monitoring for a "thumbs up" as approval.

Upon receiving approval, AWS Systems Manager Automation increases the instance type to enhance CPU capacity, followed by notifying the Slack channel once resizing is successful. If resizing isn't possible, the automation restarts the EC2 instance and notifies the team accordingly. In cases where no approval is received within an hour, the process escalates to higher support to ensure prompt resolution.

To implement this automation:

- Integrate [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/aws-cloudwatch/) with New Relic to monitor EC2 CPU metrics continuously.
- [Configure New Relic alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) a response workflow for CPU usages exceeding the specified threshold.
- Develop an automated workflow that:
  - Connects to Slack via API to post alerts and request approval, while monitoring reactions and providing notifications upon completing each action.
  - Starts an escalation process if no approval occurs within the expected timeframe.
  - Utilizes AWS Systems Manager Automation for resizing the EC2 instance upon received approval.
  - Restarts the instance if resizing is not feasible, following [AWS documentation for restarting EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-aws-restartec2instance.html).
- Set IAM permissions to enable workflow operations with AWS Systems Manager and EC2.

## HTTP Actions in Workflow Automation for Observability Tools

HTTP actions in workflow automation enhance the integration of monitoring systems with external services, streamlining incident response and data management. Hereâ€™s what you can achieve:

**Incident response and alerting**

Automatically create incidents and assign them to on-call engineers by triggering HTTP requests to external ticketing systems like Jira, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty when alerts fire. This ensures proper escalation workflows without manual intervention.

**Data integration and enrichment**

Use HTTP actions to pull contextual data from external APIs during alert processing. Fetch deployment information from CI/CD systems, retrieve configuration details from CMDBs, or gather business context from internal APIs to enrich alert notifications with relevant details.

**Notification and communication**

Send rich notifications to collaboration platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or custom webhooks. Include formatted messages with charts, runbook links, and action buttons for immediate response.

**Automated remediation**

Trigger automated fixes by calling infrastructure APIs. Examples include scaling services through cloud provider APIs, restarting failed containers via orchestration platforms, or triggering failover mechanisms in load balancers.

**Metrics and data export**

Push observability data to external analytics platforms, data lakes, or business intelligence tools. This enables correlation with business metrics and supports compliance reporting requirements.

**Custom integration points**

Use HTTP actions as universal connectors for proprietary systems. Integrate with internal tools, legacy systems, or specialized monitoring solutions that lack native integrations.

**Workflow orchestration**

Chain multiple HTTP calls to create complex workflows. Check system status across multiple services, gather approval from different teams, or coordinate maintenance windows across various platforms.

The flexibility of HTTP actions makes them essential for creating comprehensive, automated observability workflows that span your entire technology stack and organizational processes.
