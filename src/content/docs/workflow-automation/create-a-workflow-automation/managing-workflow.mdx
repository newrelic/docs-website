<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The [Workflow Automation dashboard](https://onenr.io/0gR7XE8LXjo) provides a central location to view, manage, and monitor all workflows in your account. Use the dashboard to edit configurations, track version history, manage execution schedules, and troubleshoot failures.

## Common tasks

Quick access to workflow management operations:

- **[View workflows](#view-workflows)** - Access dashboard and filter workflows
- **[Edit a workflow](#edit-a-workflow)** - Update configuration or settings
- **[Manage versions](#manage-versions)** - Understand automatic versioning and pin versions for scheduling
- **[Duplicate a workflow](#duplicate-a-workflow)** - Copy workflows when adapting templates
- **[Delete a workflow](#delete-a-workflow)** - Remove workflows permanently

## Before you begin

Before managing workflows, ensure you have:
- An active New Relic account with Workflow Automation access.
- At least one workflow in your account (from a template or custom-built).
- Edit and delete permissions for workflows.

**New to workflows?** Start with [Use a template](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template) or [Create your own workflow](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own) to build your first workflow.

## View workflows [#view-workflows]

The workflow dashboard displays all workflows in your account with key information to help you manage them.

### Access the dashboard

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. The dashboard displays all workflows with the following information:
   - **Name**: Workflow identifier you assigned during creation
   - **Description**: Purpose or function of the workflow
   - **Status**: Current state (Active, Inactive, Failed)
   - **Version**: Current version number for tracking changes
   - **Last run**: Timestamp of most recent execution
   - **Created by**: User who created the workflow

### Filter and search workflows

Use the search and filter options to locate specific workflows:

  - **Search bar**: Enter workflow name or description keywords
  - **Status filter**: Show only Active, Inactive, or Failed workflows
  - **Sort options**: Order by name, last run time, or creation date

## Edit a workflow [#edit-a-workflow]

Update workflow name, description, or configuration. Access workflow management options through the more options menu (three vertical dots) next to each workflow name.

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Select your workflow from the list.
3. Update the workflow details:
   - **Name**: Change the workflow identifier
   - **Description**: Modify the workflow purpose description
   - **Configuration**: Adjust input parameters, actions, or logic
4. Click **Save**

## Manage versions [#manage-versions]

Workflow automation automatically creates a new version every time you update a workflow definition. All previous versions remain available for reference.

### Version pinning for scheduling

When you schedule a workflow, you must pin it to a specific version. This requirement ensures that scheduled executions continue to run the same tested version even when you update the workflow definition.

**Start and schedule workflows support version pinning:**
  - When scheduling a workflow, specify which version to run
  - When manually starting a workflow run, select which version to execute
  - Existing schedules continue using their pinned version until you update them

This allows you to:
  - Update workflows without affecting running schedules
  - Test new versions manually before updating schedules
  - Maintain stability for production workflows

## Duplicate a workflow [#duplicate-a-workflow]

Duplicate workflows when you need to adapt a template or existing workflow for a different purpose while keeping the original intact.

1. Go to **All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Locate the workflow you want to duplicate
3. Click the ellipsis (three vertical dots)
4. Select **Duplicate**
5. The system creates a copy with "(Copy)" appended to the name
6. Rename and customize the duplicated workflow for your needs

**Common duplication scenarios:**
  - Adapting a workflow template for your specific use case
  - Creating a workflow for a different team with similar requirements
  - Experimenting with significant changes while preserving the original

<Callout variant="important">
  **Avoid unnecessary duplication:** Don't duplicate workflows for version control or rollback purposes - the system automatically creates versions when you update workflows. Excessive duplication can cause you to hit workflow limits. See [Manage versions](#manage-versions) for information about automatic versioning.
</Callout>

## Delete a workflow [#delete-a-workflow]

Remove workflows you no longer need.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Locate the workflow you want to delete
3. Click the more options menu (three vertical dots)
4. Select **Delete**
5. Confirm the deletion in the dialog box

<Callout variant="caution">
  Deleting a workflow removes all versions and execution history. This action cannot be undone. If you might need the workflow later, consider deactivating it instead of deleting it.
</Callout>

**What gets deleted:**
  - All versions of the workflow
  - All execution history and logs
  - All scheduled runs associated with the workflow

**Before deleting, verify:**
  - No critical automations depend on this workflow
  - You have a backup copy if you might need it later
  - All scheduled runs are identified and accounted for
