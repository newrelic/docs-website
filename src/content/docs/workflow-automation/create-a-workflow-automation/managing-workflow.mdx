<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The [Workflow Automation dashboard](https://onenr.io/0gR7XE8LXjo) provides a central location to view, manage, and monitor all workflows in your account. Use the dashboard to edit configurations, duplicate workflows for different environments, track execution history, and troubleshoot failures.

## Common tasks

Quick access to workflow management operations:

- **[View workflows](#view-workflows)** - Access dashboard and filter workflows
- **[Edit a workflow](#edit-a-workflow)** - Update configuration or settings
- **[Manage versions](#manage-versions)** - Track changes and restore previous versions
- **[Duplicate a workflow](#duplicate-a-workflow)** - Copy workflows for different environments
- **[Monitor workflow runs](#monitor-runs)** - View execution history and logs
- **[Delete a workflow](#delete-a-workflow)** - Remove workflows permanently

## Before you begin

Before managing workflows, ensure you have:
- An active New Relic account with Workflow Automation access.
- At least one workflow in your account (from a template or custom-built).
- Edit and delete permissions for workflows.

**New to workflows?** Start with [Use a template](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template) or [Create your own workflow](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own) to build your first workflow.

## View workflows [#view-workflows]

The workflow dashboard displays all workflows in your account with key information to help you manage them.

### Access the dashboard

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. The dashboard displays all workflows with the following information:
   - **Name**: Workflow identifier you assigned during creation
   - **Description**: Purpose or function of the workflow
   - **Status**: Current state (Active, Inactive, Failed)
   - **Version**: Current version number for tracking changes
   - **Last run**: Timestamp of most recent execution
   - **Created by**: User who created the workflow

### Filter and search workflows

Use the search and filter options to locate specific workflows:

- **Search bar**: Enter workflow name or description keywords
- **Status filter**: Show only Active, Inactive, or Failed workflows
- **Sort options**: Order by name, last run time, or creation date

## Edit a workflow [#edit-a-workflow]

Update workflow name, description, or configuration. Access workflow management options through the more options menu (three vertical dots) next to each workflow name.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Locate your workflow in the list
3. Click the more options menu (three vertical dots)
4. Select **Edit**
5. Update the workflow details:
   - **Name**: Change the workflow identifier
   - **Description**: Modify the workflow purpose description
   - **Configuration**: Adjust input parameters, actions, or logic
6. Click **Save**

**What happens when you edit:**
- New changes create a new version of the workflow
- Previous version remains available in version history
- Active scheduled runs continue using the version they were scheduled with until you update the schedule

<Callout variant="important">
  **Version control:** Editing a workflow creates a new version but doesn't automatically update scheduled runs. Update your scheduled runs separately if you want them to use the new version.
</Callout>

## Manage versions [#manage-versions]

Track changes and revert to previous configurations using version history.

### View version history

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Select the workflow to view its details
3. Click the **Version history** tab
4. View all versions with timestamps and change descriptions

### Restore a previous version

1. In the version history, select the version you want to restore
2. Click **Restore this version**
3. Confirm the restoration

**Why version history matters:**
- Roll back to a working version if changes cause issues
- Compare configurations across versions
- Audit workflow changes over time
- Understand when and why changes were made

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Version best practice:** Before making major changes to a production workflow, duplicate it first. This gives you an instant rollback option without navigating version history.
</Callout>

## Duplicate a workflow [#duplicate-a-workflow]

Create a copy of an existing workflow to adapt for different environments or use cases.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Locate the workflow you want to duplicate
3. Click the more options menu (three vertical dots)
4. Select **Duplicate**
5. The system creates a copy with "(Copy)" appended to the name
6. Rename and customize the duplicated workflow for your needs

**When to duplicate:**
- Create environment-specific versions (development, staging, production)
- Test modifications without affecting the original workflow
- Adapt a template for different teams or use cases
- Create a backup before making significant changes

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Best practice:** After duplicating, immediately rename the workflow and update the description to reflect its specific purpose or environment.
</Callout>

## Delete a workflow [#delete-a-workflow]

Remove workflows you no longer need.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Locate the workflow you want to delete
3. Click the more options menu (three vertical dots)
4. Select **Delete**
5. Confirm the deletion in the dialog box

<Callout variant="caution">
  Deleting a workflow removes all versions and execution history. This action cannot be undone. If you might need the workflow later, consider deactivating it instead of deleting it.
</Callout>

**What gets deleted:**
- All versions of the workflow
- All execution history and logs
- All scheduled runs associated with the workflow

**Before deleting, verify:**
- No critical automations depend on this workflow
- You have a backup copy if you might need it later
- All scheduled runs are identified and accounted for

## Monitor workflow runs [#monitor-runs]

Track workflow executions to verify they complete successfully and troubleshoot failures.

### View run history

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
2. Select the workflow to view its runs
3. Click the **Run history** tab
4. The system displays all executions with:
   - **Start time**: When the workflow execution began
   - **Duration**: How long the workflow took to complete
   - **Status**: Success, Failed, or In Progress
   - **Triggered by**: Manual, scheduled, or alert-triggered

### View execution logs

Access detailed logs to understand what happened during each workflow run:

1. In the run history, click on a specific run
2. Click **View logs**
3. The logs display:
   - Each action executed in sequence
   - Input and output values for each step
   - Error messages if any steps failed
   - Timestamp for each operation

**What logs help you understand:**
- Which step in the workflow failed
- What data was passed between actions
- How long each action took to execute
- Whether conditional logic executed as expected
