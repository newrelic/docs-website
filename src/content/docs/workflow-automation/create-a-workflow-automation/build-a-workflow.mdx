<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

The workflow automation feature in New Relic enables you to build complex workflows for the tools and services you use. It allows you to automate tasks, integrate with third-party services, and respond to events within your New Relic account.

You can create or edit workflows from the [Workflow Automation page](https://onenr.io/0gR7XE8LXjo). This page provides comprehensive information about all workflows created in your account, including the workflow name, description, status, and version number.

There are two ways to create a Workflow Automation:

* [Use a template]():
* [Create your own](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own):

Using this page, you can also **Run** an existing workflow, **Delete** a workflow, or **Duplicate** an existing one by clicking the ellipsis icon next to the workflow name.
