<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Templates provide pre-configured workflows for common scenarios—sending reports to Slack, rolling back deployments, resizing EC2 instances, and more. Deploy in minutes, then customize to match your team's process.

## Why use templates?

  - **Get started faster**: Deploy working automations in minutes
  - **Follow best practices**: Use proven patterns and error handling
  - **Learn by example**: See how actions connect and data flows
  - **Reduce errors**: Start with tested configurations

## Before you begin

Most templates need credentials and integrations:

  - **AWS templates**: [AWS credentials](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/set-up-aws-credentials) with permissions (EC2, API Gateway, Systems Manager, or SQS).
  - **Slack notifications**: Slack app with bot token and channel access.
  - **All templates**: New Relic account and entity GUIDs (unique identifiers for monitored resources).

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Don't have credentials yet?** Browse templates first. Set up credentials before deploying.
</Callout>

## Deploy a template

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Find the right template

    Browse the [template library](#workflow-automation-templates). Each shows what it does, when to use it, requirements, and how it works.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Deploy and configure

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Workflow Automation**
    2. Select **Use a Template**
    3. Choose your template
    4. Fill in inputs (credentials, entity GUIDs, queries, channels)
    5. Select **Deploy**

    Your workflow is now active.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Test and verify

    Test before production use:

    1. Trigger manually (see [Start workflows on demand](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/start-schedule#on-demand))
    2. Monitor execution in run history
    3. Check outputs (Slack messages, AWS changes, logs)
    4. Review errors, adjust configuration

    <Callout variant="important">
      **Test in non-production first.** Some templates change infrastructure. Validate before production use.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your template

Modify workflows after deployment:

  - **Add conditional logic**: Skip steps based on conditions
  - **Chain templates**: Use outputs as inputs for other workflows
  - **Adjust notifications**: Change formats, recipients, channels
  - **Add custom actions**: Include HTTP requests or data transformations

See [Create your own workflow](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own) for details.

## Troubleshooting templates

If your workflow fails or doesn't behave as expected:

1. **Check run history**: Go to **Workflow Automation > [Your Workflow] > Run History** to see execution logs and error messages
2. **Review common issues**: See [Troubleshooting Workflow Automation](/docs/workflow-automation/troubleshooting) for solutions to:
   - AWS credential and permission errors
   - Slack integration problems
   - Entity GUID issues
   - NRQL query failures
   - Workflow timeouts
   - Template-specific troubleshooting

<Callout variant="important">
  **Test templates safely**: Always test in non-production environments first. Infrastructure-changing templates (EC2, API Gateway) can impact availability if misconfigured.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>

  <Collapser
    id="send-report-to-slack"
    title="Send report to Slack"
  >

    **What it does:**

    Queries New Relic data with NRQL (New Relic Query Language), formats results as CSV, and posts to Slack.

    **When to use it:**

    Automate regular reports: daily performance summaries, weekly error rates, hourly transaction volumes, or custom metrics.

    **What you'll need:**

    - **Slack**: Bot token with channel post permissions
    - **New Relic**: Account access and valid NRQL query

    **How it works:**

    1. Runs your NRQL query
    2. Converts results to CSV
    3. Posts to Slack
    4. Logs status
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="api-gateway-rollback"
    title="API gateway rollback"
  >
    **What it does:**

    Detects deployment issues and rolls back AWS API Gateway to the previous configuration—after getting team approval.

    **When to use it:**

    Revert bad deployments that spike errors, break integrations, or cause incidents. Safety net for high-risk changes.

    **What you'll need:**

    - **AWS**: API Gateway and Systems Manager permissions
    - **Slack**: App for notifications and approval
    - **New Relic**: API Gateway entity GUID

    **How it works:**

    1. Fetches deployment history
    2. Correlates with current issue
    3. Requests Slack approval
    4. Executes rollback if approved
    5. Notifies team and cleans up

    <Callout variant="important">
      **Manual approval required.** Won't rollback without team approval via Slack reactions.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ec2-instance-management"
    title="EC2 instance management"
  >
    **What it does:**

    Automatically resizes EC2 instances when CPU or resources spike.

    **When to use it:**

    Handle CPU spikes during traffic surges, scale instances hitting limits, manage unpredictable load patterns.

    **What you'll need:**

    - **AWS**: EC2 and Systems Manager permissions
    - **Slack**: App for notifications and approval
    - **New Relic**: Alert condition monitoring EC2, [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/aws-cloudwatch/), [EC2 monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ec2-monitoring-integration/#activate)

    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Use CloudWatch Metric Streams.** Provides complete AWS metrics coverage, including custom namespaces.
    </Callout>

    **How it works:**

    1. Gets alert and identifies instance
    2. Requests Slack approval
    3. Creates automation document
    4. Stops, modifies, and starts instance
    5. Updates progress and cleans up
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="json-parsing"
    title="JSON parsing"
  >
    **What it does:**

    Fetches JSON from external status pages, parses component health, logs to New Relic.

    **When to use it:**

    Monitor third-party dependencies (payment processors, auth providers, data services), correlate outages with your issues, create unified dashboards.

    **What you'll need:**

    - **API access**: Public status endpoint returning JSON
    - **New Relic**: Account for logging

    **How it works:**

    1. Fetches JSON from endpoint
    2. Parses component health
    3. Categorizes operational status
    4. Logs to New Relic with filters

    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Schedule every 5-15 minutes** to build historical view of third-party reliability.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="deployment-rollback"
    title="Deployment rollback"
  >
    **What it does:**

    Monitors application health after deployment, sends notifications when issues arise.

    **When to use it:**

    Watch new releases post-deployment, detect production-only issues, trigger rollback workflows on health degradation.

    **What you'll need:**

    - **New Relic**: Entity GUID for monitoring
    - **Notifications** (choose one or both): AWS SQS permissions or HTTP webhook endpoint

    **How it works:**

    1. Monitors health every 1-5 minutes
    2. Evaluates alert severity
    3. Sends notifications (SQS/webhook) when degraded
    4. Logs all health checks
    5. Continues until stopped or recovered

    <Callout variant="tip">
      **Use with [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction)** to correlate issues with deployments.
