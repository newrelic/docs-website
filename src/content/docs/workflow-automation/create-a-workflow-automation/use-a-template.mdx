    **Purpose:** Create a workflow automation using the starter template to fetch the current time from a public API and log it in your New Relic account.

    **Prerequisites:**

    - Access to [worldtimeapi.org](https://worldtimeapi.org/) to fetch the current time.
    - New Relic ingest credentials for logging data.

    **Key steps:**

    - Use [**getCurrentTime**](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/#http.get) to retrive the current time from the HTTP endpoint.
    - Log the current time using [**LogTime**](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/#newrelic.ingest.sendEvents).

      For customization:
      - View the YAML code with **`</>`**
      - Add actions using the **`+`** icon
      - Implement conditional steps using the **`Switch`** action.
