<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Workflow Automation helps you streamline repetitive tasks and incident responses so your DevOps, Security, and Developer teams can focus on what matters most. Connect New Relic with your existing tools to automate processes, manage communications, and handle approvals—all without writing code. Use workflow automation to:

  - Respond to alerts automatically with predefined actions
  - Integrate with tools like Slack, AWS, Jira, and ServiceNow
  - Send enriched notifications with New Relic data to the right teams
  - Make intelligent decisions with branching logic and conditions

## What you can do with Workflow Automation [#capabilities]

### Create and manage workflows

Design, manage, and run workflows directly in New Relic—no coding required. Start with pre-built templates or combine individual actions to build custom workflows that fit your needs.

### Start workflows on-demand or on schedule

Trigger workflows manually or schedule them using the GraphQL API. To start a workflow:
  1. Provide the workflow name
  2. Specify a version (or use the latest version)
  3. Include the required input parameters
  4. Call the [StartWorkflowRun](/docs/workflow-automation/workflow-automation-apis/start-workflow-run) API

<Callout variant="important">
  You can't schedule workflows through the user interface. Use the API to schedule workflows.
</Callout>

### Add logic and conditions

Build intelligent workflows with branching logic, loops, and conditional statements:

  - **Conditional actions**: If an NRQL query detects an error, send a Slack notification. Otherwise, move to the next step.
  - **Loops**: Check the health of each AWS EC2 instance in your environment and take action based on the status.

### Include approval steps

Add human checkpoints to your workflows when decisions need review:

  - **Approval gates**: Pause workflows and require approval before proceeding with critical actions
  - **External triggers**: Resume workflows based on events from external systems

## What you can automate [#use-cases]

See how teams use Workflow Automation to solve real operational challenges:

### Automate AWS Lambda function rollback

When a Lambda function deployment fails and disrupts critical API endpoints, automatically roll back to the last stable version. New Relic detects the failure through synthetic monitoring, triggers a workflow that reverts the function using Lambda versions and aliases, and notifies your team through Slack or Microsoft Teams—all without manual intervention.

**Benefits**: Minimize downtime, ensure service continuity, and respond to failures in seconds instead of minutes.

### Respond to high EC2 CPU usage with approvals

When CPU usage exceeds your threshold, automatically alert your team in Slack and request approval to resize the instance. After approval, AWS Systems Manager scales the instance to increase capacity. If resizing isn't possible, the workflow restarts the instance. Without approval within an hour, the workflow escalates to senior support.

**Benefits**: Maintain application performance, include human oversight for infrastructure changes, and automate escalation paths.

### Integrate any tool with HTTP actions

Use HTTP actions to connect New Relic with any service or API:

- **Incident management**: Create tickets in Jira, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty when alerts fire
- **Data enrichment**: Pull deployment details from CI/CD systems or configuration data from CMDBs
- **Notifications**: Send rich messages to Slack or Microsoft Teams with charts and action buttons
- **Automated remediation**: Scale services, restart containers, or trigger failovers through infrastructure APIs
- **Data export**: Push observability data to analytics platforms or data lakes
- **Custom integrations**: Connect with internal tools, legacy systems, or specialized monitoring solutions

**Benefits**: Extend New Relic's capabilities to your entire technology stack without building custom integrations.
