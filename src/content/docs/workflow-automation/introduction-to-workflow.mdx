<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Workflow Automation connects New Relic with your existing tools to automate incident response, infrastructure management, and operational tasks—without writing code. Build workflows that respond to alerts, integrate with AWS and Slack, manage approvals, and execute complex automation logic.

## Key benefits

- **Faster incident response**: Automatically resize EC2 instances, roll back deployments, or restart services when alerts fire—no manual intervention required
- **Connect your tools**: Integrate New Relic with AWS, Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and any HTTP API to send enriched alert data where your team works
- **Add approval gates**: Include human oversight in critical workflows—request team confirmation before scaling production infrastructure or executing rollbacks
- **Handle complexity**: Use conditional logic, loops, and data transformations to automate your unique operational processes

      Deploy pre-configured workflows for common scenarios—sending reports to Slack, rolling back deployments, resizing EC2 instances, and more.

        1. Browse [available templates](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template)
        2. Select a template that matches your use case
        3. Configure inputs (credentials, entity GUIDs, queries)
        4. Deploy and test
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="custom">
      Build workflows from scratch using the drag-and-drop interface. Chain actions, add conditional logic, and integrate with your tools.

        1. Review the [EC2 auto-resize example](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own)
        2. Understand workflow patterns (switches, loops, approvals)
        3. Browse available [actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/actions-catalog)
        4. Build incrementally and test each step
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="setup">
      Configure credentials and notification channels so workflows can interact with external services.

      **AWS workflows**: [Set up AWS credentials](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/set-up-aws-credentials) (IAM roles, users, or session tokens)

      **Notifications**: [Create destinations](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/create-destinations) (Slack, email, webhooks)
