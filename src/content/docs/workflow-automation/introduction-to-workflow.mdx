Workflow Automation automates incident response and infrastructure management without code. Build workflows that respond to alerts, integrate with tools like AWS and Slack, and execute operational tasks automatically.

## Requirements

To use Workflow Automation, you need:

- A New Relic account
- Advanced Compute (aCCU) pricing plan

<Callout variant="important">
  Workflow Automation and secrets management are included with Advanced Compute (aCCU). If you're unsure whether you have aCCU, check your [account settings](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/plan-info/home) or contact your account representative.
</Callout>

## Key benefits

- **Faster incident response**: Automatically resize EC2 instances, roll back deployments, or restart services when alerts fire—no manual intervention required.
- **Connect your tools**: Integrate New Relic with AWS, Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and any HTTP API to send enriched alert data where your team works.
- **Add approval gates**: Include human oversight in critical workflows—request team confirmation before scaling production infrastructure or executing rollbacks.
- **Handle complexity**: Use conditional logic, loops, and data transformations to automate your unique operational processes.

  <TabsPages>
    <TabsPageItem id="templates">
      Deploy pre-configured workflows for common scenarios—sending reports to Slack, rolling back deployments, resizing EC2 instances, and more.

        1. Browse [available templates](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template).
        2. Select a template that matches your use case.
        3. Configure inputs (credentials, entity GUIDs, queries).
        4. Deploy and test.
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="custom">
      Build workflows from scratch using the drag-and-drop interface. Chain actions, add conditional logic, and integrate with your tools.

        1. Review the [EC2 auto-resize example](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own).
        2. Understand workflow patterns (switches, loops, approvals).
        3. Browse available [actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/actions-catalog).
        4. Build incrementally and test each step.
    </TabsPageItem>

    <TabsPageItem id="setup">
      Configure credentials and notification channels so workflows can interact with external services.

      **AWS workflows**: [Set up AWS credentials](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/set-up-aws-credentials) (IAM roles, users, or session tokens).

      **Notifications**: [Create destinations](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/create-destinations) (Slack, email, webhooks).
    </TabsPageItem>
  </TabsPages>
</Tabs>

## Trigger workflows

You can start workflows in three ways:

- **From alerts**: Automatically start workflows when alert conditions are breached
- **On demand**: Manually trigger workflows via API when needed
- **On schedule**: Run workflows automatically at specific times using cron expressions

For alert-triggered workflows, see [Send notifications from workflows](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/create-destinations#trigger-from-alerts).
