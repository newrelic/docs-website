<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Workflow Automation in the New Relic platform streamlines and automates your processes, enabling teams such as DevOps, Security, and Developers to concentrate on critical tasks and enhance system performance.

By automating routine tasks and incident responses, Workflow Automation allows you to integrate with other tools to manage processes, communications, and approvals efficiently. You can customize notifications to receive alerts about issues at the right time and place, ensuring the right information reaches the appropriate person or team. Additionally, you can enrich your notifications with detailed insights from New Relic.

## Workflow Automation capabilities [#capabilities]

Workflow Automation in New Relic offers several capabilities to enhance your processes:

- **Create workflows**: Design, manage, and execute workflows directly within New Relic without coding. Utilize templates or actions to craft custom workflows.

- **Start workflows**: Initiate workflows either on-demand or on a schedule using the `graphql` API. To start a workflow:
  - Provide the workflow name.
  - Optionally specify a version or use the latest one.
  - Include the necessary inputs for the workflow.
  - Use the [StartWorkflowRun](/docs/workflow-automation/workflow-automation-apis/start-workflow-run) API to trigger the workflow.

  Scheduling workflows through the user interface is not supported.

- **Use variables and conditions**: Incorporate decision-making into your workflows with branching logic, loops, and other controls. For example:
  - Set conditions to trigger different actions. If an NRQL query shows an error, send a Slack message; otherwise, proceed to the next step.
  - Use loops to repeat actions, such as checking the health of each AWS EC2 instance in your environment and taking specific actions.

- **Add human interaction**: Integrate steps that require human decisions before proceeding. This ensures critical decisions are made by the appropriate individuals. For example:
  - Add an approval step to review and approve parts of the workflow.
  - Pause workflows and resume them based on external events.
