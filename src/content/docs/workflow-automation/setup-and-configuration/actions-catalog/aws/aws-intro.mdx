<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

This section provides a comprehensive reference for AWS actions available in the workflow automation actions catalog. These actions enable you to integrate various AWS services into your workflow definitions, allowing you to automate operational tasks, manage cloud resources, and build sophisticated automation workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before using AWS actions in workflow automation, ensure you have:

  * An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
  * AWS credentials configured (IAM user credentials, IAM role ARN, or session credentials).
  * The necessary IAM permissions for the specific AWS services you plan to use.

See [Set up AWS credentials](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/set-up-aws-credentials/) for detailed information on how to create IAM users and IAM roles, and set up static and session AWS credentials for integration with workflow automation AWS actions.

## Available AWS actions by service

The following AWS services are available in the workflow automation actions catalog:

### [Lambda actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/lambda)

Manage and invoke AWS Lambda functions:
- **aws.lambda.invoke** - Invoke a Lambda function synchronously or asynchronously
- **aws.lambda.updateFunctionConfiguration** - Update Lambda function configuration
- **aws.lambda.getFunction** - Retrieve Lambda function details
- **aws.lambda.listAliases** - List aliases for a Lambda function

### [EC2 actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/ec2)

Manage Amazon EC2 instances and resources:
- **aws.ec2.deleteSnapshot** - Delete an EC2 snapshot
- **aws.ec2.rebootInstances** - Reboot EC2 instances
- **aws.ec2.startInstances** - Start stopped EC2 instances
- **aws.ec2.terminateInstances** - Terminate EC2 instances
- **aws.ec2.runInstances** - Launch new EC2 instances

### [Systems Manager actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/systemsmanager)

Automate operational tasks with AWS Systems Manager:
- **aws.systemsmanager.writeDocument** - Create a Systems Manager document
- **aws.systemsmanager.deleteDocument** - Delete a Systems Manager document
- **aws.systemsmanager.startAutomation** - Start a Systems Manager automation
- **aws.systemsmanager.waitForAutomationStatus** - Wait for automation completion

### [Execute API action](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/execute)

Execute any AWS API operation:
- **aws.execute.api** - Execute any AWS API for supported services

This flexible action allows you to call any AWS service API, making it possible to integrate services that don't have dedicated actions yet.

### [CloudWatch actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/cloudwatch)

Interact with CloudWatch Logs:
- **aws.cloudwatch.getLogEvents** - Retrieve log events from CloudWatch Logs
- **aws.cloudwatch.putLogEvents** - Send log events to CloudWatch Logs

### [S3 actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/s3)

Manage objects in Amazon S3:
- **aws.s3.listObjectsV2** - List objects in an S3 bucket
- **aws.s3.getObject** - Retrieve an object from S3
- **aws.s3.putObject** - Upload an object to S3
- **aws.s3.deleteObject** - Delete an object from S3

### [SNS actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/sns)

Send notifications via Amazon SNS:
- **aws.sns.publish** - Publish a message to an SNS topic

### [SQS actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/aws/sqs)

Send messages to Amazon SQS queues:
- **aws.sqs.sendMessage** - Send a message to an SQS queue

## Authentication methods

AWS actions support multiple authentication methods:

1. **IAM Role ARN** (Recommended) - Assumes an IAM role for temporary credentials
2. **IAM User Credentials** - Uses static access key and secret access key
3. **Session Credentials** - Uses temporary credentials with access key, secret key, and session token

All AWS actions accept the following credential parameters:
- `awsRoleArn` (Optional) - ARN of an IAM role to assume
- `awsAccessKeyId` (Optional) - AWS access key ID
- `awsSecretAccessKey` (Optional) - AWS secret access key
- `awsSessionToken` (Optional) - AWS session token for temporary credentials

<Callout variant="important">
  When multiple credential types are provided, the IAM role (`awsRoleArn`) takes precedence over access key credentials.
</Callout>

## Common patterns and best practices

### Security best practices

1. **Use IAM roles when possible** - IAM roles provide temporary credentials and are more secure than static access keys
2. **Apply least privilege** - Grant only the minimum permissions required for your workflow
3. **Store credentials securely** - Use workflow secrets to store sensitive credentials
4. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Follow AWS security best practices for credential rotation

### Error handling

All AWS actions return standardized outputs:
- `success` - Boolean indicating operation success
- `response` - The AWS API response (when successful)
- `errorMessage` - Error details (when unsuccessful)

Use these outputs to implement error handling in your workflows:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: invoke_lambda
    type: action
    action: aws.lambda.invoke
    version: '1'
    inputs:
      awsRoleArn: ${{ .workflowInputs.arnRole }}
      region: us-east-1
      functionName: my-function
    next:
      success: process_result
      failure: handle_error
```

### Using selectors

Many AWS actions support selectors to extract specific values from API responses:

```yaml
inputs:
  selectors:
    - name: instanceId
      expression: .response.Instances[0].InstanceId
    - name: success
      expression: .success
```

This allows you to use specific values from complex API responses in subsequent workflow steps.
