<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

This page covers two ways Workflow Automation integrates with notifications:

1. **Send notifications from workflows**: Use Slack, PagerDuty, email, or webhook actions within your workflows to notify teams when workflows complete, fail, or require approval.
2. **Trigger workflows from alerts**: Configure Workflow Automation as a destination in New Relic alerts to automatically start workflows when alert conditions are breached.

<Callout variant="important">
  **Two different concepts:**
    - **Outbound notifications**: Your workflow sends messages to Slack/PagerDuty using actions like `slack.chat.postMessage`
    - **Inbound triggers**: New Relic alerts trigger your workflow to run, passing `issueId` automatically
</Callout>

## Send notifications from workflows [#send-from-workflows]

Use these notification channels to alert your team from within your workflows. Select the right channel for your use case:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
                **Channel**

            <th>

## Before you begin

Before configuring notifications, ensure you have:

  - A workflow created in your account (from [template](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template) or [custom-built](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own)).
  - Credentials for your notification channel (Slack bot token, PagerDuty API key, etc.).
  - Credentials stored in [secrets manager](/docs/workflow-automation/limitations-and-faq/workflow-best-practices/#secure-credentials).

<Callout variant="tip">
  **For sending notifications from workflows**: Use the actions catalog to add notification actions (like `slack.chat.postMessage`) directly in your workflow steps. See [Slack actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/slack/slack-chat) and [PagerDuty actions](/docs/workflow-automation/setup-and-configuration/actions-catalog/pagerduty/pagerduty-incident).
</Callout>

## Trigger workflows from alerts [#trigger-from-alerts]

Configure Workflow Automation as a destination in New Relic alerts to automatically start workflows when alert conditions are breached. When triggered by an alert, workflows automatically receive `issueId` and `accountId` as inputs.

  1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Destinations**, and select **Workflow Automation**.
  2. To configure the **Workflow Automation**, enter the required information, such as the **Workflow Automation destination name** (a unique name for the** Workflow Automation**) and the **API Key**.
  3. Click **Save destination**.

      <img
        title="How to add a destination"
        alt="Image of the Workflow Automation destination page."
        src="/images/add-a-destination.webp"
      />

## Create an alert notification workflow [#create-the-notification-workflow]

After setting up **Workflow Automation** as a destination, create an alert notification workflow to define which alerts trigger your workflows.

<Callout variant="important">
  The steps below are for configuring **alert notification workflows** (part of New Relic Alerts), not **Workflow Automation**. Alert notification workflows route issues to destinations, including the **Workflow Automation** destination you configured above. For complete documentation on alert workflows, see [Incident workflows](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows).
</Callout>

  1. Go to **Alerts > Notification Workflows**, and select **+ Add a workflow**.
  2. To configure your notification workflow, on the Configure your notification workflow page, provide the required information:
      - Enter a unique name that you will recognize.
      - Select the **Tag**, **Policy**, and **Priority** attributes from their respective dropdowns in the **Basic** filter option to receive notifications about an incident, or opt for the **Advanced** filter option to choose **Attributes**, **Operators**, and **Values** for more detailed incident notifications.
      - Click **Additional settings** to enrich your data by building [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) to gather related data from across your New Relic platform. For enrichment examples, see [Workflow data enrichment](/docs/alerts/get-notified/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples).
  3. To specify notification destinations, in the **Notify** section, choose the **Workflow Automation** destination you created in the previous step.
  4. (Optional) You can also add other destinations like [Slack](/docs/alerts/get-notified/notification-integrations/#slack) to receive notifications alongside triggering the workflow:
      1. Select the **Slack destination** from the drop-down list.
      2. Choose the **Channel** from the drop-down list and check the **Receive notification updates on the channel** checkbox.
      3. Optionally, add a custom message in the **Custom Details** section.
      <Callout variant="tip">
        We recommend sending a test notification using **Send test notification**.
      </Callout>
      4. Select **Save message**.
  5. Select **Activate workflow**.

        alt="Image of how to configure a workflow"
        src="/images/configure-workflow.gif"
      />

## What data is passed to Workflow Automation [#data-passed]

When an alert triggers your Workflow Automation:

  - **`issueId`**: Automatically passed to your workflow. Your workflow must accept this as an input parameter. As documented in [Create your own workflow](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own), the `issueId` is "provided automatically when the workflow runs from an alert."
  - **`accountId`**: Your New Relic account ID. Your workflow must accept this as a required input parameter.

Your Workflow Automation definition must declare these inputs. For example:

  ```yaml
    workflowInputs:
      accountId:
        type: Int
      issueId:
        type: String
  ```

<Callout variant="important">
  Inputs without a `defaultValue` are required and must be provided when the workflow is triggered. You can then use `issueId` to query alert details using the NerdGraph API within your workflow.
