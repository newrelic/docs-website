<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Workflows can send notifications to your team via Slack, PagerDuty, email, or custom webhooks. Use notifications to alert teams when workflows complete, fail, or require approval.

## Choose your notification channel

Select the right channel for your use case:

| **Channel** | **Best for** | **Setup complexity** | **Features** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Slack** | Team collaboration, approvals | Easy - requires bot token | Rich messages, reactions, threads |
| **PagerDuty** | Incident management, on-call | Easy - requires API key | Escalation policies, incident tracking |
| **Email** | Formal notifications, reports | Easy - SMTP configuration | Attachments, HTML formatting |
| **Webhooks** | Custom integrations | Medium - requires endpoint | Flexible payload, any system |

## Before you begin

Before configuring notifications, ensure you have:
- A workflow created in your account (from [template](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template) or [custom-built](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own)).
- Credentials for your notification channel (Slack bot token, PagerDuty API key, etc.).
- Credentials stored in [secrets manager](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management/).

## Setup a destination [#set-the-destination]

1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Destinations**, and select **Workflow Automation**.
2. To configure the Workflow Automation, enter the required information, such as the **Workflow Automation destination name** (a unique name for the Workflow Automation) and the **API Key**.
3. Click **Save destination**.

## Create a notification workflow [#create-the-notification-workflow]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Notification Workflows**, and select **+ Add a workflow**.
2. To configure your notification workflow, on the Configure your notification workflow page, provide the required information:
    - Enter a unique name that you will recognize.
    - Select the **Tag**, **Policy**, and **Priority** attributes from their respective dropdowns in the **Basic** filter option to receive notifications about an incident, or opt for the **Advanced** filter option to choose **Attributes**, **Operators**, and **Values** for more detailed incident notifications.
    - Click **Additional settings** to enrich your data by building [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) to gather related data from across your New Relic platform. For enrichment examples, see [Workflow data enrichment](/docs/alerts/get-notified/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples).
3. To specify notification destinations, in the **Notify** section, choose one or more [**Destination**](/docs/alerts/get-notified/destinations).
4. Here's an example: to send notifications to a [Slack](/docs/alerts/get-notified/notification-integrations/#slack) group, select **Slack** as the destination type.
    1. Select the **Slack destination** from the drop-down list.
    2. Choose the **Channel** from the drop-down list and check the **Receive notification updates on the channel** checkbox.
    3. Optionally, add a custom message in the **Custom Details** section.

      We recommend sending a test notification using **Send test notification**.
    </Callout>
    4. Select **Save message**.
5. To test the workflow automation, select **Test workflow**. This uses existing data from your account to verify the configuration and sends a sample notification to ensure it reaches the Slack group.
6. Select **Activate workflow**.
