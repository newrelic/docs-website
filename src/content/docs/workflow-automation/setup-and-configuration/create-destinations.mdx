<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

To effectively build Workflow Automation for a specific condition or event, you need to set up a destination and create a notification workflow:

* **Destination**: This is the endpoint where your Workflow Automation will send notifications.
* **Notification Workflow**: This defines the actions to be taken when the specified condition or event occurs.

For more details, refer to [Destinations](/docs/alerts/get-notified/destinations).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup/) for a New Relic account.

## Setup a destination [#set-the-destination]

1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Destinations**, and select **Workflow Automation**.
2. To configure the Workflow Automation, enter the required information, such as the **Workflow Automation destination name** (a unique name for the Workflow Automation) and the **API Key**.
3. Click **Save destination**.

## Create a notification workflow [#create-the-notification-workflow]

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Notification Workflows**, and select **+ Add a workflow**.
2. To configure your notification workflow, on the Configure your notification workflow page, provide the required information:
    - Enter a unique name that you will recognize.
    - Select the **Tag**, **Policy**, and **Priority** attributes from their respective dropdowns in the **Basic** filter option to receive notifications about an incident, or opt for the **Advanced** filter option to choose **Attributes**, **Operators**, and **Values** for more detailed incident notifications.
    - Click **Additional settings** to enrich your data by building [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) to gather related data from across your New Relic platform. For enrichment examples, see [Workflow data enrichment](/docs/alerts/get-notified/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples).
3. To specify notification destinations, in the **Notify** section, choose one or more [**Destination**](/docs/alerts/get-notified/destinations).
4. Here's an example: to send notifications to a [Slack](/docs/alerts/get-notified/notification-integrations/#slack) group, select **Slack** as the destination type.
    1. Select the **Slack destination** from the drop-down list.
    2. Choose the **Channel** from the drop-down list and check the **Receive notification updates on the channel** checkbox.
    3. Optionally, add a custom message in the **Custom Details** section.
    <Callout variant="tip">
      We recommend sending a test notification using **Send test notification**.
    </Callout>
    4. Select **Save message**.
5. To test the workflow automation, select **Test workflow**. This uses existing data from your account to verify the configuration and sends a sample notification to ensure it reaches the slack group.
6. Select **Activate workflow**.
