<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Workflows can send notifications to your team via Slack, PagerDuty, email, or custom webhooks. Use notifications to alert teams when workflows complete, fail, or require approval.

## Choose your notification channel

Select the right channel for your use case:

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
                **Channel**

            <th>

## Before you begin

Before configuring notifications, ensure you have:

  - A workflow created in your account (from [template](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/use-a-template) or [custom-built](/docs/workflow-automation/create-a-workflow-automation/create-your-own)).
  - Credentials for your notification channel (Slack bot token, PagerDuty API key, etc.).
  - Credentials stored in [secrets manager](/docs/workflow-automation/limitations-and-faq/workflow-best-practices/#use-secrets-manager).

## Setup a destination [#set-the-destination]

  1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Destinations**, and select **Workflow Automation**.
  2. To configure the Workflow Automation, enter the required information, such as the **Workflow Automation destination name** (a unique name for the Workflow Automation) and the **API Key**.
  3. Click **Save destination**.

        title="How to add a destination"
        alt="Image of the Workflow Automation destination page."
        src="/images/add-a-destination.webp"
      />

## Create a notification workflow [#create-the-notification-workflow]

  1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts > Notification Workflows**, and select **+ Add a workflow**.
  2. To configure your notification workflow, on the Configure your notification workflow page, provide the required information:
      - Enter a unique name that you will recognize.
      - Select the **Tag**, **Policy**, and **Priority** attributes from their respective dropdowns in the **Basic** filter option to receive notifications about an incident, or opt for the **Advanced** filter option to choose **Attributes**, **Operators**, and **Values** for more detailed incident notifications.
      - Click **Additional settings** to enrich your data by building [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/get-notified/incident-workflows/#enrichments) to gather related data from across your New Relic platform. For enrichment examples, see [Workflow data enrichment](/docs/alerts/get-notified/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples).
  3. To specify notification destinations, in the **Notify** section, choose one or more [**Destination**](/docs/alerts/get-notified/destinations).
  4. Here's an example: to send notifications to a [Slack](/docs/alerts/get-notified/notification-integrations/#slack) group, select **Slack** as the destination type.
      1. Select the **Slack destination** from the drop-down list.
      2. Choose the **Channel** from the drop-down list and check the **Receive notification updates on the channel** checkbox.
      3. Optionally, add a custom message in the **Custom Details** section.
      <Callout variant="tip">
        We recommend sending a test notification using **Send test notification**.
      </Callout>
      4. Select **Save message**.
  5. To test the workflow automation, select **Test workflow**. This uses existing data from your account to verify the configuration and sends a sample notification to ensure it reaches the Slack group.
  6. Select **Activate workflow**.
