Streaming Video & Ads monitoring measures quality of experience (QoE) metrics as end users stream content across video players, devices, operating systems, and networks.

## What you can monitor

### Video performance metrics

* **Rebuffering ratio**: Track the proportion of playback time spent buffering
* **Video attempts**: Monitor total number of video playback attempts
* **Average bitrate**: Measure streaming quality in Mb/s
* **Average start time**: Track initial video load performance in milliseconds
* **Average watch time**: Monitor average viewing duration per session
* **Video start failure**: Identify failed video initialization attempts

### Viewer insights

* **Concurrent viewers by platform**: Track viewer counts across platforms over time
* **Video engagement**: View geographic distribution of viewers worldwide
* **User sessions**: Monitor individual user sessions with error tracking

### Quality metrics

* **Exits before video start**: Track viewers who leave before playback begins
* **High start time**: Identify slow video initialization
* **Start failures**: Monitor failed playback attempts
* **Playback failures**: Track errors during video playback

Monitor streaming performance data to troubleshoot viewer-visible problems and optimize content delivery.

* **Monitor across all platforms**: View streaming performance data for Browser, Android, iOS, and Roku applications in a unified dashboard or drill down into individual platform metrics
* **View geographic engagement**: Track concurrent viewers by platform and visualize video engagement across global regions to understand audience distribution
* **Troubleshoot with user sessions**: Access individual user session details with error counts to diagnose specific playback failures, high start times, and buffering issues
* **Identify quality issues**: Quickly identify and resolve streaming problems using quality metrics dashboards
