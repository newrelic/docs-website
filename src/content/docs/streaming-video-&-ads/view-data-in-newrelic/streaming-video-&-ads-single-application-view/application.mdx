## Overview

Application settings provides configuration for your streaming video & ads monitoring for a specific application. Configure QoE (Quality of Experience) scoring, select which KPIs to display, set quality thresholds, and choose which metric charts appear on your application's summary, video overview, and ad overview pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This document covers settings for a single application. Settings at this level apply only to this specific streaming application.

  For account-level settings that apply across all platforms, see [Application settings (All platforms)](/docs/streaming-video-&amp;-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&amp;-ads-all-platform-view/application).

### About application settings

Application settings is located within a specific entity under **Settings > Application** and contains four main configuration sections:

1. **QoE health index scores status** - Set status level thresholds (Good/Warning/Critical) that determine color indicators on the QoE health index card
2. **Key performance indicators (KPI) display** - Select which KPI cards appear on summary, video overview, and ad overview pages
3. **Key performance indicators (KPIs) threshold** - Define quality thresholds that determine a "Good" vs "Impacted" viewing session
4. **Quality metric charts** - Choose which trend charts appear in the video quality metrics and ad quality metrics sections

### What is QoE score

QoE (Quality of Experience) score provides a single percentage representing overall streaming health for this application. A session is "Good" only if it meets ALL quality thresholds; failing any single threshold makes it "Impacted."

Formula: `QoE health index = (Number of Good view sessions / Total number of attempts) × 100`

### Who should read this

- **Application developers**: Configure quality standards and KPI displays specific to your application's characteristics
- **Product managers**: Set application-specific quality thresholds to assess if your app meets quality targets
- **Support teams**: Troubleshoot issues using the QoE health index and selected KPIs
- **Operations engineers**: Monitor application-specific quality metrics

## Configure QoE health index status levels

Set three status levels with color-coded indicators to show streaming health at a glance. These thresholds determine when the QoE health index card displays as green (Good), yellow (Warning), or red (Critical).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">
        Status level
      </th>
      <th>
        Recommended threshold
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Good** (Green)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score &gt; 80%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Warning** (Yellow)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score 60 - 80%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Critical** (Red)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score &lt; 60%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**To configure**:
1. Enter your desired percentages
2. Click **Save**

These thresholds apply only to this application. The QoE health index card on this application's summary page will display with the corresponding color.

**To configure**:
1. Check the boxes for KPIs you want to display
2. Click **Save**

## Configure quality thresholds

Define what constitutes a "Good" viewing session for this application. A session must meet ALL thresholds to be classified as "Good." Failing even one threshold makes it "Impacted."

These thresholds apply to the QoE health index calculation for this application.

### Video failure threshold

Choose whether a "Good" session can contain failure events:
- Must not contain any failure events (recommended)
- Can contain failure events

### Startup time threshold (seconds)

Maximum acceptable time for the first frame to display.
- Standard range: 2 - 5 seconds
- Recommended: < 5 seconds

### Rebuffering ratio threshold (%)

Maximum acceptable rebuffering as a percentage of total playback time.
- Standard range: 0.25 - 1.0%
- Recommended: < 0.4%
- Enter value in decimals (e.g., 0.4 for 0.4%)

### Rebuffering time threshold (seconds)

Maximum acceptable total rebuffering time during a session.
- Standard range: 15 - 30 seconds
- Recommended: < 2 seconds

### Average bitrate thresholds by device type

Configure minimum acceptable bitrate for each device type.

## Use cases by role

### As an application developer

Configure quality standards specific to your application. Set thresholds based on your application's content type, audience expectations, and target devices. Adjust over time as you optimize your application.

### As a product manager

Monitor whether the application meets its quality targets. Compare metrics before and after releasing updates. Filter by appVersion to assess if new releases improved quality.

### As a support team member

Use the QoE health index to investigate user-reported problems. View impacted sessions to understand specific issues. Track whether issues are resolved after deploying fixes.

### As an operations engineer

Monitor application-specific QoE health index. Use dimensions (like region or ISP) to identify which areas experience issues. View selected metric charts to understand quality trends.

## Data access via NerdGraph API

Access QoE health index and related metrics programmatically via the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph). Available metrics include QoE health index percentage, count of "Good" and "Impacted" views, and QoE score filtered by attributes like device type, region, or ISP.
