## Errors list view [#list-view]

Begin by examining the page loads errors chart for a quick overview of any unusual spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general.

Match any trends you observe on the top 5 errors chart with alerts that happened at the same time.

* <DNT>**Dynamic grouping:**</DNT> By default, error occurrences are grouped according to the error message. You can modify the grouping criteria using any attribute, select up to five attributes simultaneously.

* <DNT>**Filtering:**</DNT> Numerous New Relic customers implement [custom attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/collect-custom-attributes/#enabling-custom). Filtering on a specific custom attribute can be a quick way to cut through the noise of all error occurrences.

## Errors details view [#details-view]

On this page, you can dive deep into a specific error group: Perhaps you've identified a specific group of hosts that is causing an error spike. The detailed view provides in-context details.

From the detailed view, you can cycle through specific errors using the toggle in the upper right to navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, or any instance between.

At the top of the details page, you can inspect the <DNT>**Filtered**</DNT> and <DNT>**Grouped By**</DNT> fields to see how the information was filtered and grouped. You may receive a permalink of a specific occurrence. It's important to know the filters and group-by selections to understand the context of the occurrence.

### Occurrences tab [#error-group-occurrences]

The <DNT>**Occurrences**</DNT> tab includes not only error frequency, occurrence details, and stack traces, it also includes triage information and related distributed traces.

### Triage section [#triage-card]

The triage section links the specific error occurrence you're viewing to a [system-created error group](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#groups) that has a unique fingerprint. Why does that matter? That unique fingerprint  enables you to triage an error group using a [status](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#status) update or [assignment](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#assign). The system-created error groups are the ones you find on the <DNT>**Triage**</DNT> tab. For more info on how they are generated, see [How error groups work](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#how-groups-work).
