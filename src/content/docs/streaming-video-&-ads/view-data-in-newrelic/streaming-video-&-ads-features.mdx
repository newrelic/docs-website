You may have hundreds of several applications serving video content across different platforms, and require monitoring video and ad playback in all the applications. To help manage this complexity, New Relic enables you to view video and ad playback telemetry data from an individual application or across all applications on various platforms:

* [All platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-all-platform-view/overview): View video and ad playback telemetry data from all applications where the video agent has been instrumented.
* [Individual platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-single-application-view/overview): View video and ad playback telemetry data from a specific application/platform where the video agent has been installed.
