## Overview

New Relic Streaming Video & Ads monitoring provides comprehensive visibility into video and ad playback performance across your streaming infrastructure. Whether you have a single application or hundreds of applications serving video content across different platforms, you need to monitor video and ad playback quality, user engagement, and streaming performance.

### Choosing the right view for your needs

To help manage the complexity of monitoring multiple streaming applications, New Relic enables you to view video and ad playback telemetry data from an individual application or across all applications on various platforms:

* [All platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-all-platform-view/overview): View video and ad playback telemetry data from all applications where the Streaming Video & Ads agent has been instrumented. Use this when you need to compare performance across multiple applications or monitor overall streaming health.
* [Individual platform view](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-single-application-view/overview): View video and ad playback telemetry data from a specific application where the Streaming Video & Ads agent has been installed. Use this when you need to deep dive into a specific application's performance or troubleshoot platform-specific issues.
