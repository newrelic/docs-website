## Overview

Application settings provides centralized configuration for your streaming video & ads monitoring across all platforms. Configure QoE (Quality of Experience) scoring, select which KPIs to display, set quality thresholds, and choose which metric charts appear on your video overview and ad overview pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This document covers settings for all platforms. Settings at this level apply across all your streaming entities.

  For entity-specific settings, see [Application settings (Single application)](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/view-data-in-newrelic/streaming-video-&-ads-single-application-view/application).

### About application settings

Application settings is located in **Settings > Application** and contains four main configuration sections:

1. **QoE health index scores status** - Set status level thresholds (Good/Warning/Critical) that determine color indicators on the QoE health index card
2. **Key performance indicators (KPI) display** - Select which KPI cards appear on video overview and ad overview pages
3. **Key performance indicators (KPIs) threshold** - Define quality thresholds that determine a "Good" vs "Impacted" viewing session
4. **Quality metric charts** - Choose which trend charts appear in the video quality metrics and ad quality metrics sections

### What is QoE score

QoE (Quality of Experience) score provides a single percentage representing overall streaming health across all platforms. A session is "Good" only if it meets ALL quality thresholds; failing any single threshold makes it "Impacted."

Formula: `QoE health index = (Number of Good view sessions / Total number of attempts) × 100`

### Who should read this

- **Administrators**: Configure quality standards, thresholds, and KPI displays that apply across all streaming applications at the account level
- **Business analysts and executives**: Use the QoE health index as a single metric to report on overall video business health
- **Product managers**: Assess if product changes meet quality standards across all platforms
- **Operations engineers**: Monitor and troubleshoot streaming performance across all platforms

## Configure QoE health index status levels

Set three status levels with color-coded indicators to show streaming health at a glance. These thresholds determine when the QoE health index card displays as green (Good), yellow (Warning), or red (Critical).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">
        Status level
      </th>
      <th>
        Recommended threshold
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Good** (Green)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score greater than 80%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Warning** (Yellow)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score 60 - 80%
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Critical** (Red)
      </td>
      <td>
        Score less than 60%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**To configure**:
1. Enter your desired percentages
2. Click **Save**

These thresholds apply to all streaming platforms. The QoE health index card on video overview will display with the corresponding color.

## Select KPIs to display

Choose which KPI cards appear on video overview and ad overview pages across all platforms.

**Available video overview KPIs**:
- Rebuffering ratio
- Video attempts
- Avg. bitrate
- Avg. start time
- Avg. watch time
- Video start failure
- Video playback failure

**Available ad overview KPIs**:
- Ad rebuffering ratio
- Ad attempts
- Avg. ad bitrate
- Avg. ad start time
- Avg. ad watch time
- Ad start failure
- Ad playback failure

**To configure**:
1. Check the boxes for KPIs you want to display
2. Click **Save**

## Configure quality thresholds

Define what constitutes a "Good" viewing session. A session must meet ALL thresholds to be classified as "Good." Failing even one threshold makes it "Impacted."

These thresholds apply to the QoE health index calculation for all platforms.

### Video failure threshold

Choose whether a "Good" session can contain failure events:
- Must not contain any failure events (recommended)
- Can contain failure events

### Startup time threshold (seconds)

Maximum acceptable time for the first frame to display.
- Standard range: 2 - 5 seconds
- Recommended: less than 5 seconds

### Rebuffering ratio threshold (%)

Maximum acceptable rebuffering as a percentage of total playback time.
- Standard range: 0.25 - 1.0%
- Recommended: less than 0.4%
- Enter value in decimals (e.g., 0.4 for 0.4%)

### Rebuffering time threshold (seconds)

Maximum acceptable total rebuffering time during a session.
- Standard range: 15 - 30 seconds
- Recommended: less than 2 seconds

### Average bitrate thresholds by device type

Configure minimum acceptable bitrate for each device type.

## Use cases by role

### As an administrator

Configure quality standards that apply across all streaming applications. Set thresholds based on your content type, audience expectations, and network conditions. Select which KPIs and charts to display based on team needs.

### As a business analyst or executive

Use the QoE health index percentage as a single metric to report on video business health to leadership. Monitor whether the score meets business targets across all platforms.

### As a product manager

Monitor QoE score before and after product launches or app updates across all platforms. Filter by platform or appVersion to see if changes improved or degraded QoE. Use dimensions (like region or ISP) to identify if specific areas are affected.

### As an operations engineer

Monitor QoE health index in real-time during live broadcasts. If score drops suddenly, use dimensions to identify which platforms or regions are impacted. View impacted sessions to see specific failure patterns.

## Data access via NerdGraph API

Access QoE health index and related metrics programmatically via the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph). Available metrics include QoE health index percentage, count of "Good" and "Impacted" views, and QoE score filtered by attributes like device type, region, or ISP.
