## Overview

The QoE (Quality of Experience) Score provides a comprehensive metric to assess service quality and user satisfaction for streaming video content. This feature allows you to define quality thresholds, configure KPI (Key Performance Indicator) settings, and view real-time quality scorecards across all monitored streaming applications.

The QoE Score feature includes:

- QoE Score configuration page for setting thresholds and quality parameters
- KPI settings page for enabling or disabling specific metrics
- QoE scorecards displayed alongside KPI cards on the Video Overview page
- Customizable columns in User Sessions screen with QoE-related metrics
- QoE Score as a dimension option in the Video Overview page

## Prerequisites

Before using the QoE Score feature, ensure you have the following:

### Agent Requirements

Your streaming video monitoring agent must be installed and instrumented on one or more of the following platforms:

- **Browser**: Beta release available
- **Android**: Agent in review
- **iOS**: Development in progress
- **Roku**: Development in progress

### User Permissions

Only users with the following roles can update QoE settings at the account level:

- **All_Product_Admin**: Full access to configure QoE settings
- **Standard_User**: Can update QoE configurations and KPI settings

By default, all other users have read-only access to QoE configurations and can view QoE scorecards.

### Data Retention

The data retention for Media Streaming is currently set to 30 days, which applies to QoE score data.

## View the QoE Score page

To view the QoE Score metrics on the Video Overview page, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Streaming Video & Ads > Video Overview**</DNT>.

The Video Overview page displays the QoE Health Index card alongside other KPI cards, providing a comprehensive view of your streaming video quality and user experience.

## Understanding QoE Health Index

The **QoE Health Index** card displays a percentage score that represents the overall quality of experience for your streaming video content. This score is calculated based on the configured thresholds and quality parameters set by administrators.

- **Green card**: Indicates good overall quality (typically above 90%)
- **Percentage value**: Shows the current QoE score
- **Trend indicator**: Arrow and percentage showing the change from the previous time period
- **Trend line**: Visual representation of QoE score changes over the selected time range

The QoE Health Index provides a quick at-a-glance assessment of whether your video streaming service is meeting quality expectations.

## QoE KPI Cards

The Video Overview page displays multiple KPI cards that provide detailed metrics related to Quality of Experience. These cards are customizable through the KPI settings page.

## Using filters

The Video Overview page includes a filter bar at the top that allows you to narrow down the data displayed across all QoE and KPI cards.

You can filter by:
- **platform**: Device type (Browser, Android, iOS, Roku)
- **title**: Content title
- **appVersion**: Application version
- **isp**: Internet Service Provider

To apply filters:
1. Click on any filter dropdown in the filter bar
2. Select "All" to view all data, or choose specific values
3. Click the **+** icon to add additional custom filters

All KPI cards and metrics will update automatically based on your filter selections.

## Video quality metrics

The **Video quality metrics** section displays detailed trend charts for key quality indicators. By default, 4 metrics are selected and displayed:

- **Total plays**: Trend of total video plays over time
