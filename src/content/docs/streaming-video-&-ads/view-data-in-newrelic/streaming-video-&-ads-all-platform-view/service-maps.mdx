The Entity Relationship feature establishes connections between your Browser or Mobile entities and Media Streaming entities. When video content plays within your web or mobile application, you can track data flow to the media player entity, enabling visibility into cross-platform streaming performance.

Use this feature to:
  - Monitor video playback performance across your applications
  - Identify performance bottlenecks in video delivery pipelines
  - Analyze user engagement with embedded video content
  - Track dependencies between application services and media streaming infrastructure
  - Troubleshoot issues affecting video playback quality

This feature provides:
  - Real-time visualization of entity relationships in service maps
  - Data correlation between application and media streaming telemetry
  - Enhanced observability for cross-platform video delivery
  - Improved troubleshooting capabilities for streaming issues
  - Consolidated monitoring of user video consumption patterns

## Prerequisites

Before establishing entity relationships, ensure you have:
- An active Browser or Mobile monitoring entity
- An active Media Streaming monitoring entity
- Parent app ID configured in your media streaming instrumentation

## Configure Streaming Media & Ads with browser/mobile

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Configure parent application id

      1. In your media streaming application code, implement the parent app ID parameter
      2. Pass the Browser or Mobile entity's application ID as the parent app ID when initializing the media streaming entity
      3. Ensure the parent app ID matches exactly with the source entity's ID
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Entity creation

      1. Navigate to New Relic and create/verify your Browser entity is active
      2. Create your Media Streaming entity in Streaming Video & Ads
      3. Confirm both entities are reporting data successfully
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Establish relationship

      1. Deploy your application with the parent app ID configuration
      2. Generate user activity that flows from browser/mobile to media streaming
      3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the relationship to be established automatically
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Verification

      1. In Browser entity:
        - Navigate to your Browser entity
        - Check the **[Dependencies](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/explore-downstream-dependencies-new-relic-one/)** section
        - Verify the media streaming entity appears as a connected service
      2. In Service maps for Streaming Video & Ads:
        - Navigate to your Media Streaming entity
        - Verify the parent relationship is visible in service maps
        - Access the [Service Map](docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/service-maps/) view
        - Confirm both entities are displayed with connection lines
        - Use the query `FROM Relationship SELECT * where targetEntityGuid = '<media_streaming_entity_guid>'` to verify the relationship type shows as **connects_to**
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Monitoring & analysis
      - Use Service Maps to visualize the complete user journey
      - Monitor dependency health and performance metrics
      - Cross-reference data between related entities for comprehensive analysis
  </Step>
