The Entity Relationship feature for Streaming Video & Ads enables customers to establish and visualize connections between their Browser/Mobile entities and Media Streaming entities. This feature allows users to track how video content flows from their web applications (like BBC News) to media players, providing visibility into cross-platform user journeys and media consumption patterns.

A customer is entitled to use a Browser entity and is also entitled to use Media Streaming. When video content plays within the browser entity, a media entity
  is created.

  To see the relationship between these two entities:
  - When a video plays in the browser entity, data flows to the media player entity
  - The parent app ID (browser or mobile entity app ID) establishes this relationship
  - The relationship type displays as "connects to"

  Multiple browser or mobile entities can send data to the same media player entity.

    Primary Scenarios:

  1. News/Media Websites: Track users moving from news articles to embedded video content (e.g., BBC News website â†’ BBC News Media Player)
  2. E-commerce Platforms: Monitor product page visits that lead to promotional video views
  3. Educational Platforms: Correlate course page navigation with video lesson consumption
  4. Multi-platform Applications: Understand user journey across web, mobile, and media streaming touchpoints

  Target Users:

  - DevOps teams monitoring application performance
  - Product managers analyzing user engagement flows
  - Site reliability engineers tracking service dependencies

## Key Benefits:
  - Visualize relationships between browser/mobile apps and media streaming entities
  - Track user flow from web applications to video content
  - Monitor dependencies and service connections through service maps
  - Establish data correlation using parent application IDs

## Prerequisites

  - Account Requirements:
    - Active New Relic Browser monitoring subscription
    - Active New Relic Streaming Video & Ads monitoring subscription
    - Both entities must be under the same New Relic account

  - Technical Requirements:
    - Browser or Mobile entity already configured and sending data
    - Media Streaming entity set up and operational
    - Application instrumentation that can pass parent application IDs

  - Access Permissions:
    - Read/write access to both Browser and Streaming Video & Ads entities
    - Service map viewing permissions

## Configure Streaming Media & Ads with browser/mobile

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Configure Parent Application ID

      1. In your media streaming application code, implement the parent app ID parameter
      2. Pass the Browser or Mobile entity's application ID as the parent app ID when initializing the media streaming entity
      3. Ensure the parent app ID matches exactly with the source entity's ID
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Entity Creation

  1. Navigate to New Relic and create/verify your Browser entity is active
  2. Create your Media Streaming entity in Streaming Video & Ads
  3. Confirm both entities are reporting data successfully

  ### Step 3: Establish Relationship

  1. Deploy your application with the parent app ID configuration
  2. Generate user activity that flows from browser/mobile to media streaming
  3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the relationship to be established automatically

  Step 4: Verification

  1. In Browser Entity:
    - Navigate to your Browser entity
    - Check the "Dependencies" section
    - Verify the media streaming entity appears as a connected service
  2. In Service Maps:
    - Access the Service Map view
    - Confirm both entities are displayed with connection lines
    - Relationship type should show as "connects to"
  3. In Streaming Video & Ads:
    - Navigate to your Media Streaming entity
    - Verify the parent relationship is visible in service maps

  Step 5: Monitoring & Analysis

  - Use Service Maps to visualize the complete user journey
  - Monitor dependency health and performance metrics
  - Cross-reference data between related entities for comprehensive analysis
