<Callout variant="tip">
This guide is for one-time migration from pre-version 3.xx to version 3.xx. If you're already on version 3.xx and need to update to a newer version, follow the standard update procedures for your platform.
</Callout>

To make migrating from earlier versions as easy as possible, we have developed a compatibility layer that translates most of the configuration options to their new counterparts. This compatibility layer is temporary and will be removed in the future. We encourage you to read this guide carefully and migrate the configuration under human supervision.

## Migration to Version 3.xx

To experience the new curated view, you must migrate to version 3.xx of the media agent.

### Dual Event Type Complications

There is a chance that after migration, some of your end-users may not have opted for the app upgrade, or very few have. During this interim period, you could experience dual event types, which can be complicated. To manage this:

* Gather all the query and action mappings.
* Inform your end-users that during this interim period, they may see data in multiple events and how they are related.

This applies to the mobile agent. For the browser, it will be upgraded automatically.
</Callout>

### Viewing Data Post-Migration

After migration, if you want to see data for the past month, we recommend that you use any custom dashboard or query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pageAction
```

<Callout variant="important">
With named event definitions, they lose the dashboard capability for querying the old data.
</Callout>

### Event Definition Mapping

Event type mapping between old and new versions is customer-specific based on your implementation. To ensure a smooth transition and maintain data integrity, contact New Relic customer support for a customized migration plan.

We recommend you carefully follow this guide and ensure that all configurations are migrated under supervision. The compatibility layer is a temporary solution, and it is important to transition to the new configuration as soon as possible.
