Install the video agent by including a JavaScript code snippet in your application.

## Before you begin

Complete the [common installation steps](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/browser/get-started-with-browser#install) first (Steps 1-5: Access platform → Select Browser → Select video player).

## Place JavaScript snippet in frontend code [#install-snippet]

1. Provide a name to your application and click **Save and Continue**.

2. Install the latest release from the New Relic platform by copying the code snippet and running it in your terminal (Mac user) / Command prompt (Windows user).

3. After the script is downloaded, include the code snippet displaying in the platform to your application to start monitoring your video player.

4. Select **Get Application Info**. This would generate the application id for the browser entity generation.

5. Click **See your data**.
