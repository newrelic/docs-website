    Our Streaming Video & Ads monitoring provides a real viewer monitoring solution that measures quality of experience (QoE) metrics as your end users stream content through different video players, devices, operating systems, and networks. But streaming monitoring goes far beyond providing information about the initial video load. Use it to measure startup time, buffering ratio, completion rates, and error frequencies to get the info you need to help ensure viewer satisfaction and maximize ad revenue.

    New Relic lets you monitor the data from streaming activity and optimize performance. Use Streaming Video & Ads monitoring to help ensure successful content delivery and quickly troubleshoot viewer-visible problems. Monitor your stack at a glance and make sure all your entities are operating as they should. Visualize video performance and ad delivery, user engagement insights, quality assurance metrics and more. Spend less time trying to chase down streaming issues and more time delivering optimal playback experiences that reduce churn and increase ad revenues.
