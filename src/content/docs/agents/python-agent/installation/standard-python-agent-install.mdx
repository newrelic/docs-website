If your Python application uses one of our [supported frameworks](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages), you can use our launcher or follow this guide to install the [Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python) and get it reporting data.

If you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more details and context for the install procedures, see [Advanced installation](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation). You can also install the Python agent in a [Google App Engine flexible environment](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/install-new-relic-python-agent-gae-flexible-environment).

For more about Python agent compatibility, see [Compatibility and requirements](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent).

## Install steps [#install]

<Callout variant="important">
  The instructions below are for [applications on frameworks that the Python agent automatically instruments](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages). To monitor non-web Python scripts, custom background tasks, or an application on a non-auto-instrumented framework, see [Monitor non-web scripts/functions](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-background-tasks).

  If you are using Docker, install the agent **within each** container.
</Callout>

To install the New Relic Python agent for an application on an [auto-instrumented framework](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages):

1. Make sure you have your New Relic [license key](/docs/subscriptions/license-key). (If you don't yet have a New Relic account, [sign up to get one](https://newrelic.com/signup).)
2. Install the **newrelic** Python package using **pip** by running:

   ```
   pip install newrelic
   ```
3. Generate the agent configuration file by running the command:

   ```
   newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini
   ```
4. If you control how your web application or WSGI server is started, use the following New Relic admin script command in front of your usual startup command options:

   ```
   NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
   ```

   If you cannot run the admin script in this way, please read the [advanced install instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation) for more context and other install options.
5. Start or restart your Python web application or WSGI server. Wait five minutes and look for data in your New Relic account.

For install instructions with more details and helpful context, see [Python agent installation](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).
