This is a detailed guide showing how to install New Relic's [Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python) for application performance monitoring. For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the [standard installation guide](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start). Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps.

## Requirements

Before you install the Python agent:

* Read and understand the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent).
* Have your New Relic account's [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key). (If you don't have one already, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).)

## Summary of install process [#overview]

Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent:

1. Download and install the Python agent package.
2. Create config file.
3. Integrate the agent with your app.
4. Restart your app.

You can also install the Python agent in a [Google App Engine flexible environment](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/install-new-relic-python-agent-gae-flexible-environment) or use other [hosting services](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/), such as Heroku.

## 1. Download and install [#install]

Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="pip"
    title="pip install (RECOMMENDED)"
  >
    Install the **newrelic** package directly from PyPi by running:

    ```
    pip install newrelic
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="easy_install"
    title="easy_install"
  >
    Run:

    ```
    easy_install newrelic
    ```

    We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="buildout"
    title="Buildout install"
  >
    Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the **newrelic** package using the `zc.recipe.egg` recipe.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual"
    title="Manual download and install"
  >
    To obtain the package manually:

    1. Download the appropriate **tar.gz** file from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).
    2. Unpack the **tar.gz** file.
    3. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running:

       ```
       python setup.py install
       ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      This should be the `python` executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the `sudo` command or run the command as root.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## 2. Create config file [#config]

The [config file](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration) is the primary method to customize the agent's behavior. You can also use server-side configuration or environment variables.

After you install the package, the `newrelic-admin script` will be in the same directory as the Python executable. To create the agent config file, run this command in the Python executable's directory and include your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key):

```
newrelic-admin generate-config <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var> newrelic.ini
```

The `generate-config` command creates the `newrelic.ini` config file.

## 3. Integrate the agent [#integration]

You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the `newrelic-admin` script in front of your usual app startup command.

If you use any of the following services, follow these guidelines before continuing to the admin script procedure.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="uwsgi"
    title="uWSGI"
  >
    The agent can be used with uWSGI version 1.2.6 or higher. The recommended integration method (using the admin script via the command line) can be used for uWSGI, but you will need to supply certain specific command line options to the **uwsgi** executable. These include:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width={250}>
            Option
          </th>

          <th>
            Purpose
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `--enable-threads`
          </td>

          <td>
            By default uWSGI does not enable threading support within the Python interpreter core, so you cannot create background threads from Python code. However, the Python agent relies on being able to create background threads, so this option is required. To automatically configure uWSGI for multiple threads, use the `--threads` option.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `--single-interpreter`
          </td>

          <td>
            By default uWSGI will execute Python code within a sub-interpreter of the process rather than the main Python interpreter created when Python is first initialized. This allows multiple separate Python web applications to run within one process, but keep them separated so they do not interfere with each other.

            Older versions of uWSGI can fail when using sub-interpreters with threading enabled. **Recommendation:** Use the `--single-interpreter` option, and restrict it to a single web application per process.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mod_wsgi"
    title="mod_wsgi"
  >
    If you use `mod_wsgi`, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must [manually integrate](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration) the Python agent in your app code.

    If you use `mod_wsgi-express`, you **can** run the admin script via the command line. For more information, see the [New Relic mod_wsgi documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms/python-agent-modwsgi).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tornado-4"
    title="Tornado 6"
  >
    The agent currently provides support for Tornado 6 only. For more information, see the [Tornado 6 web framework documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/web-frameworks-servers/python-agent-tornado-6-web-framework).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="webfaction"
    title="WebFaction"
  >
    Python web applications on WebFaction typically use `Apache/mod_wsgi`. With `mod_wsgi`, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must [manually integrate](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration) the Python agent in your app code.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

To run the `newrelic-admin` script via the command line, place the following in front of your standard app startup command:

1. The path to the New Relic config file
2. The `newrelic-admin run-program` script command

For example, here are instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell. If you use a Python gunicorn web server and your startup command is:

```
gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application
```

Then use this command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application
```

For more details about using the admin script, see [Running the admin script from command line](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#wrapper-script). If you cannot use the admin script method or don't want to, see the [manual integration method](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration).

## 4. Restart app and check for data [#check-data]

When you finish the integration procedure:

1. Restart your app server.
2. Wait five minutes.
3. View your app's data in APM's [Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).

If data does not appear after five minutes, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-python).

## Additional steps [#next-steps]

Here are some suggested next steps after installing the Python agent for your app:

* Explore your data in New Relic One and get comfortable with the [standard user interface features](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions).
* Learn about APM's [Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page), the [Transactions page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page), and other [performance monitoring features](/docs/apm).
* [Change your application's name](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application), and use other [configuration options](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration).
* Set up [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation) for application activity not monitored by default.
* Configure [custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-new-relic-apm-agents) and [custom attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/add-custom-attributes-apm-data) to collect additional data from your app.
