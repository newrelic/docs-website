This documentation explains requirements and tips for integrating the Python agent with apps that use `Apache/mod_wsgi` or `mod_wsgi-express`. To return to the general install instructions, go to [Install the for Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Use Apache/mod_wsgi

The Python agent supports the use of [`Apache/mod_wsgi`](http://www.modwsgi.org/). Follow the standard instructions for [manual integration with your Python application](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-and-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration) when using Apache/mod_wsgi.

<Callout variant="caution">
  The recommended integration procedure of running the admin script via the command line cannot be used with Apache/mod_wsgi.
</Callout>

## Use mod_wsgi-express

A new feature, called `mod_wsgi-express`, was introduced in version 4.1.0 of `mod_wsgi`, and it offers an alternate way to integrate the agent.

If you are using `mod_wsgi-express` with a WSGI application, it is possible to use the script's `--with-newrelic` option with your app's startup command. Although the `mod_wsgi-express` script and `--with-newrelic` flag are different than the `newrelic-admin` script, they serve the same purpose of configuring your application to wrap the execution of your server.

When using the `--with-newrelic` option, make sure the Python agent is installed and you've created your `newrelic.ini` config file.

For example, using the agent with Django may require a command similar to:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini mod_wsgi-express start-server mysite/wsgi.py --with-newrelic
```
