Web2py is an open source framework for creating web-based Python applications. You can integrate the Python agent with your Web2py app to monitor your app's performance. For general install procedures, see [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Integrate with Web2py

Choose the Web2py set-up you use from the list below for more information:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="running-with-runweb2py"
    title="Runweb2py command"
  >
    If you run your web application using the **runweb2py** command, use the following command:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=/some/path/newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program runweb2py
    ```

    `newrelic-admin` is a script that wraps your application startup, so that the agent can monitor your application's major functions. For more on running the wrapper script, see [Running the wrapper script](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="running-with-mod_wsgi"
    title="Apache/mod"
    title="_"
    title="wsgi"
  >
    When using Apache/mod_wsgi, you **must** manually insert code in the WSGI script file you are using in order to initialize the Python agent. For more info, see [our mod_wsgi documentation](/docs/python/python-agent-and-mod_wsgi).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="running-with-gunicorn"
    title="Gunicorn"
  >
    For information on using Gunicorn with the agent, see [Python agent and Gunicorn documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms/python-agent-and-gunicorn).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="running-with-uwsgi"
    title="uWSGI"
  >
    For information on using uWSGI with agent, see the [Python agent and uWSGI documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms/python-agent-and-uwsgi).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For general install procedures, see [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).
