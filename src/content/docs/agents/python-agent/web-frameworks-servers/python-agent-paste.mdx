This documentation contains requirements and tips for integrating the ython agent with an app that uses the [Paste HTTP server](http://pythonpaste.org/modules/httpserver.html). For general install instructions, go to [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Admin script integration method [#integrated-server]

The recommended admin script integration method will work if the `paste.httpserver.serve()` API function is used directly. For more on the admin script process, see the [general installation procedures](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration).

## Using PasteDeploy

If rather than manually incorporating the call to startup the Paste HTTP server in your application code, you are using PasteDeploy with a configuration similar to:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:Paste#http
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

all you instead need to do to start up your WSGI application is wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```
