## Syntax

```
newrelic.agent.application(name=None)
```

Returns object corresponding to an agent monitored app; required by some Python agent API calls.

## Description

This call returns an object corresponding to an agent-monitored application. If no `name` value is set, the name [set via the Python agent configuration](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#app_name) is used.

The returned application object does not present any public API, but is required by some other API calls.

<Callout variant="important">
  This call only returns the application object. It won't attempt to register the application with the data collector if this has not already occurred.
</Callout>

## Parameters

<Table>

    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Parameter

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `name`

        _string_
      </td>

      <td>
        Optional. The name of the application. If set, this overrides the application name set via Python agent configuration.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Return values

Returns an application object. The object itself does not present any public API, but is required by some other API calls.

## Examples

### Generate and use an application object

To generate an application object, use:

```
import newrelic.agent

app = newrelic.agent.application()
```

Some other Python agent API calls take the application object as a parameter. For an example, see the [`record_exception`](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/record_exception) call.
