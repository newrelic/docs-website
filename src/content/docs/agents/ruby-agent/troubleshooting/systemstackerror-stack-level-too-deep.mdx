## Problem

You receive the error message `SystemStackError: stack level too deep` on the Error details page in your APM UI.

In addition, because of a bug in Ruby versions 2.1 and lower, you might receive only a one-line stack trace that points to the Ruby agent as the issue.

## Solution

In most cases, the Ruby agent is not the underlying issue. The issue is that `alias_method` and `Module#prepend` work together only in particular situations and can cause non-terminating recursions when not used together properly.

1. Upgrade to Ruby version 2.2 or higher to fix the one-line stack trace bug. Then, review the full stack trace to see if the Ruby agent is the issue.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you can't upgrade, refer to the URL included in the `SystemStackError` message to troubleshoot the issue or [disable the Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#disabling) to see if the problem disappears.
   </Callout>
2. If the Ruby agent is not the cause of the error, look for evidence of non-terminating recursions including the following:
   * You don't find `new_relic` near the top of the trace.
   * You see repeating patterns in the trace.
3. If you see evidence of a recursion, make sure that `alias_method` and `Module#prepend` are compatible with each other when used on the same method.

       * Verify that your app always calls `alias_method` before `Module#prepend` when used on the same method.
       * Also, check to see if your app calls `Module#prepend` before the **Ruby agent** calls `alias_method` on the same method. If so, follow the recommendations in the New Relic blog post about [resolving `Module#prepend` and `alias_method` conflicts](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/12/15/ruby-agent-module-prepend-alias-method-chains/).

## Cause

When your app uses `Module#prepend` on a method that the Ruby agent later uses an `alias_method` on, it creates a non-terminating recursion and throws the `SystemStackError: stack level too deep` error.

If you upgraded to Rails 5, which deprecated `alias_method_chain`, you might have replaced `alias_method` with `Module#prepend`, and that could be the source of your issue.
