New Relic clones the Ruby repository on GitHub at [newrelic-ruby-agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/tree/main). GitHub also hosts limited rdoc-generated documentation: [rdoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent](https://rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent).

The head of main will generally have New Relic's latest release. However, we reserve the ability to push an edge to the master. If you download a release from GitHub, use the appropriate tag. We usually push beta versions of a release to a working branch before tagging them for General Availability.

Fork away and feel free to send us pull requests (branches only please) for any ideas or bugfixes you come up with at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/).
