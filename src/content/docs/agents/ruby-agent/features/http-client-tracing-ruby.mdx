The Ruby agent can trace outgoing HTTP requests made by your application or script in order to:

* Record metrics about how long your HTTP requests are taking and which hosts they're hitting.
* Annotate transaction traces with nodes for each HTTP request.
* Provide [cross application tracing](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/cross-application-tracing-ruby) for requests between applications instrumented with New Relic.

## Supported HTTP client libraries [#supported_libraries]

The following HTTP client libraries are currently supported by the Ruby agent:

<Table>

      <th width={200}>

</Table>

## Excon notes [#excon]

The Ruby agent supports Excon version **0.10.1 or higher.** Excon instrumentation for Excon versions 0.19.0 and up relies on the ability to add an Excon middleware to the `:middlewares` key of `Excon.defaults`, so if your application modifies `Excon.defaults` you should ensure that you preserve the value of the `:middlewares` key.

## Typhoeus notes [#typhoeus]

The Ruby agent supports Typhoeus version **0.5.3 or higher**.

Parallel requests made via the `Hydra` mechanism in Typhoeus currently only have partial tracing support. For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Requests made via the `Hydra` mechanism will also not get cross application tracing support.

Testing has shown significant issues with segfaults when running Typhoeus on MRI 1.8.7.  
**Recommendation:** Use Ruby Enterprise Edition or MRI 1.9.3 or higher to avoid these problems.

## Curb notes [#curb]

The Ruby agent supports Curb version **0.8.1 or higher.** Curb instrumentation on JRuby is **not** supported.

Requests made via the `Curl::Multi` API currently only have partial tracing support (equivalent to what is offered for requests made via the Typhoeus `Hydra` API). For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Requests made via the `Curl::Multi` mechanism will also not get cross application tracing support.
