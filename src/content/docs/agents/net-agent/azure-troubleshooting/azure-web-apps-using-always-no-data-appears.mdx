<Callout variant="important">
  Beginning with .NET agent version [8.22.181.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/net-agent-8221810), Azure's `Always On` setting may be enabled without interfering with the agent. If you'd like to use `Always On`, simply [update the agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-net-agent-azure-web-apps).

  If your application [targets .NET Framework 4.0 or lower](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/technical-support-net-framework-40-or-lower), `Always On` will still interfere with the agent and the workarounds below are still applicable.
</Callout>

## Problem

You installed New Relic's .NET agent through [Microsoft Azure Web Apps](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps) and are using Azure's `Always On` setting. After generating some traffic and waiting a few minutes for data collection to start for your app, data still does not appear in the APM user interface.

## Cause

If no data appears within five minutes, Azure's [`Always On` setting](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-create-web-jobs/) may be conflicting with New Relic. This feature is only available in Azure's **Basic** and **Standard** modes.

The `Always On` setting prevents the environment variable `APP_POOL_ID` from being set. New Relic's .NET agent needs this environment variable to get the app name. If the agent cannot determine an application name, then it won't start up.

## Solution

If you are using Microsoft's **Standard** or **Basic** tiers with the Azure Portal, ensure that the `Always On` setting is disabled.

1. In the Azure Portal, select **(your app) > Settings > Application Settings**.
2. Set the `Always On` toggle to `Off`.

## Other options

Here are some other options you can try. If these do not work, you **must** [turn off the `Always On` setting](#solution).

    To name your application in the local **newrelic.config** using Kudu:

    1. From the Microsoft Azure Portal, select **(your app) > Tools > Kudu**, then select **Go**.
    2. Select **Debug Console > CMD**.
    3. Select **Site > wwwroot > newrelic**.
    4. Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       icon for `newrelic.config`, and add:

       ```
       <application>
         <name> <var>Your app's name</var> </name>
       </application>
       ```
    5. Save and restart your application.

      This option has been found to only be a temporary fix. The .NET agent may stop reporting intermittently.
    </Callout>

    To name your application in its `app/web.config` file:

    1. Add the following key to `appSettings`:

       ```
       <appSettings>
         <add key="NewRelic.AppName" value="<var>Your app's name</var>" />
       </appSettings>
       ```
    2. Restart your instance.

    Depending on your usage of `Always On`, you can try using [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) to keep your website active.

    * If you **are not** using the `Always On` setting, you can try using the Synthetic monitoring free [pinger monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#monitor-type-ping).
    * If you **are** using the `Always On` setting, Synthetic monitoring needs to be able to reach an endpoint for your worker roles. If it can't, you can try using a [Synthetics scripted monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers) to run on your site.
