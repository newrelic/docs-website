## End of life notice [#eol]

As of October 2017 you cannot create a New Relic account through Microsoft's Azure Marketplace Portal. Instead, if you have an Azure ID but do not already have a New Relic account, [contact New Relic Sales](https://newrelic.com/about/contact-us).

For more information, see the [Azure transition information](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-apm-for-azure-marketplace-eol-notice/52358) in New Relic's Online Technical Community.

## Install New Relic .NET agent [#app-services]

Continue with the procedures to install the New Relic .NET agent with your Azure app as applicable for:

* Microsoft's [Web App Services](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps) in the Azure Portal
* Microsoft's [Cloud Services](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-cloud-services) platform

The .NET agent's support for Microsoft Azure is not the same as [Infrastructure monitoring's integrations with Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations). Azure integrations have separate [integration installation procedures](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations).
