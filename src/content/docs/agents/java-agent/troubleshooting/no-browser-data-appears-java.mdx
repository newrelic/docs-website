## Problem

You [installed the Browser monitoring agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent) for your Java app, but the app is not reporting data in the [Browser UI](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary).

## Solution

If your application server does not use the Jasper JSP compiler (for example, you use WebSphere or WebLogic), auto-instrumentation is not available. Instead, you must [manually instrument Browser](/docs/java/page-load-timing-in-java#manual_instrumentation).

If your app server does use the JSP compiler and you still do not receive Browser data, you may have a configuration conflict. New Relic's Java agent allows you to set an app name either in the `newrelic.yml` configuration file or automatically with your `web.xml` `display-name`.

To verify that your app is reporting to the correct name:

1. Temporarily generate [`finest` level logs](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting).
2. Search the log file for `"enabled for"`. Verify that your app name appears on the list of apps that are reporting [Browser timing data](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/page-load-timing-java).
3. If the listed app name does not match the expected name, verify that you are setting the same app name in `newrelic.yml` and the `web.xml` `display-name` setting.
