Pinpoint and solve issues down to the line of code with Node.js monitoring from New Relic. With features like [service maps](/docs/data-analysis/service-maps/get-started/introduction-service-maps) and [error analytics](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors), our Node.js agent allows you to get the full picture of your app environment.

Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to:

* Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns).
* Identify slow requests.
* Group metrics.
* Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance.

## What you need

Before you install our Node.js agent, review the [system requirements](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent).

## Installation

To install our agent, you need to [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup) first. It's fast and free â€” we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in.

## Extend your instrumentation

After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation:

* VM measurements: [Install an additional native module](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vm-measurements) to [view detailed VM statistics](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vms-statistics-page).
* Enable [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing).
* [Custom instrumentation:](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/nodejs-custom-instrumentation) Implement Node.js custom instrumentation.
* [Collect custom metrics:](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/nodejs-custom-metrics) Collect custom metrics via an API call.
* [Node.js agent API:](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/nodejs-agent-api) Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Node.js agent.
* [Browser timing process:](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-nodejs) Integrate the agent with [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) to gain visibility into user activity.
* Open source telemetry: You can use our [Node Telemetry SDK](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic) to create your own integrations.

## Troubleshoot your installation

If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information:

* [Large memory usage](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-large-memory-usage-nodejs): If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions.
* [Troubleshooting your Node.js installation](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-nodejs-installation): Try these steps if you don't see any data, cannot log files, or encounter other installation problems with the Node.js agent.
* [Troubleshooting Browser instrumentation](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-page-load-timing-nodejs): If you encounter problems with Browser data, see these additional tips for Node.js.

You can also [view all troubleshooting docs](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting). If you need additional assistance, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Check the source code

The Node.js agent is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/main/README.md "Link opens in a new window.").
