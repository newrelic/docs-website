Read on to learn how to enable and instrument [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) for the New Relic's C SDK.

## Enable distributed tracing [#enable]

To enable distributed tracing for a New Relic-monitored C application:

1. Create a default [`newrelic_app_config_t`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__app__config__t.html) and set the `distributed_tracing.enabled` field to `true`.

   ```
   newrelic_app_config_t* config
       = newrelic_create_app_config(app_name, license_key);
   config->distributed_tracing.enabled = true;
   ```
2. Continue with the procedures to [instrument transactions and HTTP requests](#guidelines).

  [Span events](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__span__event__config__t.html#details) can be enabled/disabled separately from distributed tracing.
</Callout>

## Instrument transactions and HTTP requests [#guidelines]

For transactions that occur in multiple services, the distributed trace payload contains information that allows New Relic to stitch them together into a complete transaction trace. However, if New Relic-monitored services are not sending trace context to each other, it will result in incomplete trace details. For more information, see the documentation about [passing the distributed tracing API header](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) and the [C SDK's distributed tracing documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#distributed-tracing).

        Create and return a payload to be sent to the called service
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload()
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Accept a payload sent from the first service
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload()
        ```

        This will link these services together in a trace.

        Return a base64-encoded JSON string representation of the payload
      </td>

      <td>
        ```
        newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe()
        ```

        This offers the same behavior as `newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload()`.
