As a general purpose programming language, C gives you the opportunity to instrument a wide range of applications. If your app does not use [other New Relic APM agent languages](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#agent), you can use the C SDK to take advantage of New Relic's monitoring capabilities and features. You can:

* Identify and solve performance issues.
* Improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions.
* Monitor data from detailed dashboards in [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure), [Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), and more.
* Query, visualize, and share your data with charts and dashboards by using [Insights](/docs/insights/using-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).
