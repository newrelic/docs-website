You can install the [PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet [PHP agent requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our [observability platform](https://one.newrelic.com), join the New Relic family! [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever.

## Container options [#overview]

The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a [daemon](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes), which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments:

* [Install agent and daemon on different containers.](#install-diff-containers) This is the recommended setup.
* [Install agent and daemon on the same container.](#install-same-container) This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers.

## Install agent and daemon in different containers [#install-diff-containers]

Requirements:

* Meet [PHP agent requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements)
* PHP agent version 9.2 or higher

To see an example application, go to [New Relic's Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-php-agent-and-daemon-containers/84841).

<Callout variant="caution">
  Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is **not** encrypted. The only exception to this is the [SQL obfuscation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-tt-sql) that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon.
</Callout>

### Set up the daemon container [#daemon-container]

If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/php-daemon):

1. Run this command: `docker pull newrelic/php-daemon`.
2. To customize the image, follow the steps on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/php-daemon).

You can also build your own daemon image:

1. To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's [tar file download site](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file), and run the `newrelic-install` script with the `install_daemon` argument.
2. Start the daemon using `--address` and `--watchdog-foreground` arguments.

The `--address` argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The `--watchdog-foreground` argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground.

### Set up the PHP agent container [#agent-container]

To set up the PHP agent container for Docker:

1. Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like `php:7.1`.
2. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's [tar file download site](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file), and run the `newrelic-install` script with the `install` argument.
3. In the `newrelic.ini` file, set the application name and [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) with the `newrelic.appname` and `newrelic.license` entries .
4. Point the agent to the daemon by setting the `newrelic.daemon.address` option in the `newrelic.ini` file. Make sure the value for this option is `HOST:PORT`, where `HOST` is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and `PORT` is the port number where the daemon is listening

## Install agent and daemon in the same container [#install-same-container]

To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container:

1. Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like `php:7.1`.
2. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's [tar file download site](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file) and run the `newrelic-install` script with the `install` argument.
3. Set the application name and [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) via the `newrelic.license` and `newrelic.appname` entries in the `newrelic.ini` file.
4. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both `newrelic.daemon.start_timeout` and `newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout` entries in the `newrelic.ini` file to recommended values.

    RUN \

      export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \
      export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \
      /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \
      rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \
      sed -i \
          -e 's/"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY"/"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"/' \
          -e 's/newrelic.appname = "PHP Application"/newrelic.appname = "YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME"/' \
          -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \
          -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \
          /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini
    ```

    You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile:

    * `PHP_AGENT_URL`: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to **[download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/](https://download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/)**.
    * `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`: Replace this with your [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). Note that `"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY"` is an actual string in the default **newrelic.ini** file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The `sed` command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes.
    * `YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME`: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.
