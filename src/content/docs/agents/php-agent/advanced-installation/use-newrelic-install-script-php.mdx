The interactive `newrelic-install` script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will:

* Copy the correct PHP modules into place.
* Install sample `ini` files.
* Configure the New Relic proxy daemon.

<Callout variant="important">
  Be sure to review the information about [working with multiple installations and non-standard locations](#install-multiple) before running the script.
</Callout>

## Find the installer script [#location]

The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent.

* Via system package manager: The installation script is in the `/usr/bin` directory.
* Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the **tar** archive file. The script in the **tar** distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager.

## Work with multiple PHP installations [#install-multiple]

For `newrelic-install` to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your `PATH` environment variable is correctly set. The `newrelic-install` script can only install the agent for versions it can find.

        Override `NR_INSTALL_PATH` and `PATH`
      </td>

      <td>
        Specify a set of directories in the `NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST` environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the **php-config** script.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Invoke the installer script [#invocation]

The script has two modes: [install](#install-install) and [uninstall](#install-uninstall). If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode.

From the command line, run the script at its location:

* Via system package manager: `/usr/bin/newrelic-install`
* Via a **tar** archive directory: `./newrelic-install`

## Use the install mode [#install-install]

<Callout variant="important">
  As of [PHP agent version 4.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-40518), the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use [PHP agent version 3.9.5.13](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-39513). If you need help, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

Follow this process to install New Relic.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="invoke"
    title="1. Invoke install mode."
  >
    Invoke install mode by using **one** of these methods:

    * Run `newrelic-install` with the `install` command line option.
    * Run `newrelic-install` with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="license-key"
    title="2. Provide your New Relic license key."
  >
    At the prompt, enter your New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key). This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="select-version"
    title="3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable."
  >
    If `newrelic-install` finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP.

    **Example:** The menu shows seven options:

    ```
    1)   /usr/bin
       2)   /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin
       3)   /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin
       4)   /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin
       5)   /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin
       6)   /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin
       7)   /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin

       0)   Exit

       Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all):
    ```

    At the menu, use any of these options:

    * To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use.
    * To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers.
    * To select every version listed, enter the keyword `all`.
    * To exit the installation process, Enter `0`.

    For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt.

    <Callout variant="important">
      For PHP installations that allow multiple **.ini** files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the **.ini** files you will need to modify manually.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="daemon"
    title="4. Install the daemon if applicable."
  >
    If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon.

    If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon.

    If installation is successful, the script will show this final message:

    ```
    New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations!
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="restart-web-server"
    title="5. Restart your web server."
  >
    To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server.

    <Callout variant="important">
      If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active.

    title="6. Note your archive file."

    Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at **/tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar** and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting.

    After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your [APM **Summary** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).

    To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the [PHP configuration options](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Use the `install-daemon` mode [#install-daemon-mode]

<Callout variant="important">
  Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher.
</Callout>

To install the daemon without the agent, run `newrelic-install` with the `install_daemon` command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with [agent install on containers](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/install-php-agent-docker)).

## Troubleshoot your PHP installation [#troubleshoot]

If there were problems with the installation process, or if [no data appears](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-php) in APM, review the [PHP troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting) before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your [archive file](#archive-file) to any bug report, as well as the output of the [`phpinfo()`](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/submitting-troubleshooting-results-php) function produced by your web server.

## Uninstall mode [#install-uninstall]

You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="uninstall-keep"
    title="Uninstall and keep config files."
  >
    This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options:

    * Invoke `newrelic-install` with the `uninstall` option.
    * Run `newrelic-install` with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script.

    The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any `newrelic.ini` files that you have modified.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="uninstall-permanent"
    title="Permanently uninstall New Relic."
  >
    To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke `newrelic-install` with the `purge` option.

    This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will **not** affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as `php.in`. Also, this will **not** remove the software packages installed on the system.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see [Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS)](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-redhat-and-centos#uninstalling) or [Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian)](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-and-debian#uninstalling).
