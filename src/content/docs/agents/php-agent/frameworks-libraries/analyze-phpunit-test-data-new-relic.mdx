If you use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to manage and run your unit tests, the New Relic PHP agent can automatically capture the test summary results and send them to [New Relic](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/understanding-insights/new-relic-insights) as an [event](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/understanding-insights/new-relic-insights#database) where you can query and visualize test data at a glance. This feature was released in version **6.7.0** of the PHP Agent and supports PHPUnit versions **3.7** to **8.x**

## Enable PHPUnit test events [#phpunit-enable]

To enable PHPUnit test events:

1. Find or add the `newrelic.phpunit_events.enabled` setting in your `newrelic.ini` file and set it to `true`.
2. Restart your web server (apache, PHP-FPM, Nginx, etc) for the setting change to take effect.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Exception messages are collected and sent with events. Also, if you use PHPUnit's `--disallow-test-output` option, which flags tests that print output as "risky," the test event will include the offending output.
</Callout>

## View available attributes [#phpunit-view-attributes]

When [enabled](#phpunit-enable), the PHP Agent detects PHPUnit commands and populates New Relic with two event types that contain data for the test suite (named [`TestSuite`](#testsuite-event-attributes)) and individual tests (named [`Test`](#test-event-attributes)). You can query the data with [NRQL queries](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql) and [build a dashboard](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/building-insights-dashboards) of information important to you.

To query your test events, use `FROM TestSuite` and `FROM Test` when specifying your `SELECT` statements:

```
SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM TestSuite
```

## Example queries

A dashboard of test summary data allows you to quickly see a snapshot of overall test success as well as dig into failing suites to determine their cause. These examples illustrate the kinds of widgets you can create with both `TestSuite` and `Test` event types.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="percent-success"
    title="Percent success"
  >
    What percent of suites or tests are passing?

    ```
    SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE successful IS true) FROM TestSuite
    ```

    ```
    SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE outcome = 'passed') FROM Test
    ```

    </figcaption>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="test-outcome"
    title="Test outcome"
  >
    What is the breakdown of test outcomes?

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM Test FACET outcome
    ```

    ![PHPUnit_test_outcomes.png](./images/PHPUnit_test_outcomes.png "PHPUnit_test_outcomes.png")

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="test-failures"
    title="Test failures"
  >
    What percent of the time does each test pass?

    ```
    SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE outcome = 'failed') FROM Test FACET name
    ```

    ![PHPUnit_test_failure.png](./images/PHPUnit_test_failure.png "PHPUnit_test_failure.png")

    <figcaption>
      What percent of the time does each test pass?
    </figcaption>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="suite-failures"
    title="Test suite failures"
  >
    What percent of the time does each suite pass, and is that consistent over time?

    ```
    SELECT histogram((passedCount / testCount)*100, 100, 10) FROM TestSuite FACET name
    ```

    ![PHPUnit_passing_histogram.png](./images/PHPUnit_passing_histogram.png "PHPUnit_passing_histogram.png")

    <figcaption>
      What percent of the time does each suite pass, and is that consistent over time?
    </figcaption>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="duration"
    title="Duration"
  >
    How long does each test suite take to run, and is that consistent over time?

    ```
    SELECT histogram(duration*1000, 10, 20) FROM TestSuite FACET name
    ```

    ![PHPUnit_duration_histogram.png](./images/PHPUnit_duration_histogram.png "PHPUnit_duration_histogram.png")

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Linked facets

Because a PHPUnit test suite is linked to individual tests via its run ID, you can use [`FACET` widgets to filter results](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/editing-insights-dashboards#facet-linking) for a specific test run.

For example, if you created a widget with the most recent failing test suites and linked it to the current dashboard, you could click on a test and the surrounding widgets would update with information for only that test suite run.

![PHPUnit_facet_on_runId.png](./images/PHPUnit_facet_on_runId.png "PHPUnit_facet_on_runId.png")

<figcaption>
  FACET widget (top-left) linked to the current dashboard allows you to drill into failing test suites.

In the above example, you can see that by clicking on run `5bb37ccee2a1dbc7`, we learn that one of two tests, `testFoo`, failed. Here are the NRQL queries that made up this example:

**Recent unsuccessful suites:**

```
SELECT latest(timestamp), latest(name) FROM TestSuite WHERE successful IS false FACET runId
```

**Last unsuccessful suite:**

```
SELECT host, name, duration * 1000 AS 'duration (ms)', assertionCount, testCount, passedCount, failedCount, incompleteCount, skippedCount, errorCount, riskyCount, warningCount FROM TestSuite WHERE successful IS false LIMIT 1
```

**Last unsuccessful test:**

```
SELECT host, name, testSuiteName, duration * 1000 AS 'duration (ms)', outcome, assertionCount, message FROM Test WHERE outcome != 'passed' LIMIT 1
```

## PHPUnit event attributes

`TestSuite` and `Test` events contain the following attributes you can query against:
