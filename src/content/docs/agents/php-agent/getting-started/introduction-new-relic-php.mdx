Our PHP agent monitors your application to help you [identify and solve performance issues](#monitor-performance). You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to [collect and analyze business data](#business-data) to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions.

* Create and share customizable, interactive [dashboards](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data)

## Architecture

The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic:

* The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code.
* The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform.

You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes [sampling](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/new-relic-events-limits-sampling) when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers.
</Callout>

![This diagram shows the flow of data from the PHP agent to New Relic.](./images/PHP_Agent_Diagram_5.png "PHP_Agent_Diagram_4.png")

<figcaption>
  The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic.
</figcaption>

The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order:

1. The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data.
2. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called [agent mode](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced) and is the default.

To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established.

## Install the agent [#installation]

Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the [system requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements). The PHP agent supports many of the most common [PHP frameworks](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#frameworks), [databases](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#databases), and [libraries](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#databases). You can also use the agent in a [Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/install-new-relic-php-agent-gae-flexible-environment).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are [installing the agent on a shared hosting service](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/install-php-agent-shared-hosting-service), ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance.
</Callout>

To install the agent, [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup) first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations.

For **standard installations**, see:

* [PHP agent installation overview](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview) (the basic installation steps for the most common setups).
* [Installing on RedHat or CentOS](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-redhat-and-centos)
* [Installing on Ubuntu or Debian](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-and-debian)
* [Installing with tar archive](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file) (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc)
* [The newrelic-install script](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/newrelic-install-script) (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks)

For other types of PHP installations and **advanced installation** topics, see:

* [PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php)
* [Starting the PHP daemon](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced) (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also [start the daemon manually](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced#selecting-external))
* [Silent mode for the install script](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/running-php-install-script-silent-mode)
* [Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/install-new-relic-php-agent-gae-flexible-environment) for New Relic's PHP agent

## Configure the agent [#configuration]

The agent includes a variety of [configuration options](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration) to further customize and fine-tune your installation.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a [descriptive name](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-appname). New Relic [uses this app name to aggregate metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application#app-name) when you have multiple apps or hosts.
</Callout>

After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server.

## Extend agent instrumentation [#extend]

After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation:

* [Page load timing](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php): Integrate the PHP agent with [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) to gain visibility into end-user activity.
* [Custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/php-custom-instrumentation): Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation.
* [Agent API](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-api): Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely.
* [Agent attributes](/docs/agents/php-agent/attributes/php-agent-attributes): Customize the [attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-metrics/agent-attributes) attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions.

## Troubleshoot your installation [#troubleshoot]

If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our [full list of troubleshooting documentation](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting). Common installation issues include:

* [No data appears (PHP)](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-php)
* [Determining permissions requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determining-permissions-requirements)
* [INI settings not taking effect immediately](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/ini-settings-not-taking-effect-immediately)
* [Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/why-when-restart-your-web-server-php)
