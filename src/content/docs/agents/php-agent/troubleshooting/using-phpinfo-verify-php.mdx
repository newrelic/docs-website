## Problem

New Relic does not report data within a few minutes of restarting your web server after installing the PHP agent.

## Solution

Use `phpinfo()` to verify that the agent was installed successfully:

1. Create a simple `.php` webpage within your website that contains the following:

   ```
   <?php phpinfo(); ?>
   ```
2. Navigate to this page in a web browser and scroll through the alphabetical list of modules to find `newrelic`. If you do not see `newrelic` in this list, either you are using a non-standard version of PHP, or you have not restarted your web server (or other PHP host) since installing New Relic.
3. Restart your web server to see if `newrelic` appears in your modules list.
4. If `newrelic` does not appear in your modules list, [check your extensions directory](/docs/php/php-kb-104) to see if you have a [non-standard version of PHP](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php).
5. If `newrelic` does appear in your modules list, verify that the `license.key` entry shows the first and last few characters of your [license key.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key#finding)
6. If `license.key` is not appearing, [check your loaded configuration files directory](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/checking-loaded-configuration-files-directory)

  **Sample `phpinfo()` File**: If data does not appear on your New Relic [APM **Summary** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) within a few minutes after configuring both the PHP agent and the proxy daemon, check the New Relic section of your phpinfo() file to verify that New Relic is installed.
