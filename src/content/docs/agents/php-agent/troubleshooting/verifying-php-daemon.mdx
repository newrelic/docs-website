## Problem

You have installed New Relic's PHP agent and daemon, but the daemon does not appear to be functioning.

## Solution

Verify that the daemon is running correctly:

1. Execute this shell command to list running processes that match "newrelic-daemon":

   ```
   ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon
   ```
2. Verify the daemon is running by checking the output from the previous command for two running daemon processes that look like this. If they are not listed, proceed to the next step.

   ```
   newrelic     1368     1  0 00:28 ?     00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ...
   newrelic     1370  1368  0 00:28 ?     00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ...
   ```
3. If no processes are listed, your daemon is not running and you must start the daemon based on the startup mode it is in:

   * [Agent mode startup](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced#daemon-external) (default)
   * [External mode startup](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced#daemon-autostart) (advanced)
