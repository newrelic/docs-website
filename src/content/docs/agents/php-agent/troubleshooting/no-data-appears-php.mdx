## Problem

After [installing the New Relic PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview), generating some traffic, and waiting at least five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI.

## Solution

If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Compatibility
      </td>

      <td>
        Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's [compatibility and requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Non-standard PHP version
      </td>

      <td>
        If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the [advanced installation procedures](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php) to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        App name
      </td>

      <td>
        Make sure your apps have a [descriptive, unique name.](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application#app-name) For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name `PHP Application`, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Web server
      </td>

      <td>
        Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `phpinfo()`
      </td>

      <td>
        Check `phpinfo()` to [verify that you installed the PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/using-phpinfo-verify-php) and that the [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key) in it is correct.

      <td>
        If your system uses SELinux, [configure SELinux](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/data-stops-reporting-while-using-selinux#solution) to work with the PHP agent.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Log files
      </td>

      <td>
        1. Verify that both the agent and the daemon are [writing to their log files](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting-php).
        2. If not, [reinstall the agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview).
        3. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user.

      <td>
        Make sure you have the [correct permissions](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determining-permissions-requirements) to use the PHP agent.
