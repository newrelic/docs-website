## Problem

The New Relic PHP agent does not support any Apache multi-processing model (MPM) that involves threading.

## Solution

The PHP language development team [discourages the use of a threaded MPM with Apache](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php "Link opens in a new window"), and we have chosen not to implement support for threaded MPMs in the PHP agent for similar stability reasons. This includes the **worker** and **event** MPMs.

If the default, non-threaded **prefork** MPM is unsuitable for your needs for performance reasons, we suggest using **mod_fcgid** and **php-fpm** to use PHP via FastCGI instead.
