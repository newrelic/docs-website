## Syntax

```
newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers (array $headers)
```

Inserts W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Tracing headers into an outbound array of headers.

## Requirements

Requires PHP agent [version 9.8 or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes).

## Description

Use `newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers` to manually add distributed tracing headers an array of outbound headers.

When Distributed Tracing is enabled, `newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers` will always insert W3C trace context headers. It also, by default, inserts the New Relic Distributed Tracing header, but this can be disabled via the `newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header` INI setting.

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `$headers`

        _array_
      </td>

      <td>
        Required. An (optionally empty) array of outbound headers. This argument is passed by reference, and therefore must be a variable as opposed to a literal.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Return values

`True` if any headers were successfully inserted into the provided array, otherwise returns `False`
