## Syntax

```
newrelic_ignore_transaction()
```

Do not instrument the current transaction.

## Parameters

This call does not accept any parameters.

## Examples

```
function example() {
    if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available
        newrelic_ignore_transaction();
    }
    <var>...</var>
}
```
