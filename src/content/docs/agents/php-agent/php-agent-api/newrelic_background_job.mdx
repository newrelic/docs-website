metaDescription: 'New Relic PHP agent API call to define a particular transaction as a background job (for example, for cron jobs).'

## Syntax

```
newrelic_background_job([bool $flag])
```

Manually specify that a transaction is a background job or a web transaction.

## Requirements

Compatible with all agent versions.

## Description

Tell the agent to treat this "web" transaction as a "non-web" transaction (the APM UI separates web and non-web transactions, for example in the [Transactions page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page)). Call as early as possible. This is most commonly used for cron jobs or other long-lived background tasks. However, this call is usually unnecessary since the agent usually detects whether a transaction is a web or non-web transaction automatically.

You can also reverse the functionality by setting the optional flag to `false`, which marks a "non-web" transaction as a "web" transaction.

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `$flag`

        _boolean_
      </td>

      <td>
        Optional. Defaults to `true`.

        If `true` or omitted, the current transaction is marked as a background job.

        If `false`, the transaction is marked as a web transaction.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Examples

### Mark transaction as a background job [#mark-as-background]

    if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available
	    newrelic_background_job();
    }
    <var>...</var>
}
```

### Mark transaction as a web transaction [#mark-as-web]

```
function example() {
