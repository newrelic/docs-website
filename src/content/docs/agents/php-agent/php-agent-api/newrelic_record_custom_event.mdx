## Syntax

```
newrelic_record_custom_event(string $name, array $attributes)
```

Record a custom event with the given name and attributes.

## Requirements

Agent version [4.18.0.89](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-418089) or higher.

## Description

Records a [custom event](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#custom%20event) for use in [New Relic](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/understanding-insights/new-relic-insights). For more information, see [Inserting custom events with the PHP agent](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events-new-relic-agents#php-att).

<Callout variant="tip">
  When creating custom events, follow these rules:

  * The agent records a maximum of 10,000 events per minute. Limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically.
  * Avoid using [reserved words](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/reserved-words) and characters for the event and attributes names.
  * Ensure you do not exceed the event size and rate restrictions.
