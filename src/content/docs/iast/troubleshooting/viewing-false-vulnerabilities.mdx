## Problem 

I see a vulnerability that is not an actual vulnerability (false positive) for my application.

## solution

Update the status of your vulnerability if you think IAST has reported a false positive. Follow these steps:

- Search your application: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>.

- Click on the all applications tab and select the vulnerability that is not an actual vulnerability.

- Under the vulnerability details section, you can update the vulnerability status for the reported vulnerability. You can update its status to:
    - False positive
    - Resolved
    - Unresolved

- If you want to list out the vulnerabilities for which you updated the status, you can apply the filter in the detected exploitable vulnerabilities list.
