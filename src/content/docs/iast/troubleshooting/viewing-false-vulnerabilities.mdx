## Problem 

I see a vulnerability that isn't an actual vulnerability (false positive) for my application.

## solution

Update the status of your vulnerability if you think IAST has reported a false positive. Follow these steps:

* Search for your application: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>.

* Click the **All applications** tab and select the vulnerability that isn't an actual vulnerability.

* Under the **Vulnerability details** section, you can update the vulnerability status for the reported vulnerability. You can update its status to:
    * False positive
    * Resolved
    * Unresolved

* If you want to list out the vulnerabilities for which you updated the status, you can apply the filter in the detected exploitable vulnerabilities list.
