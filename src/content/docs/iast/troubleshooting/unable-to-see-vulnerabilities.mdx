## Problem
You can see your application in the New Relic UI and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in the UI.

## Solution

If this is a new app, firewalls could be preventing it from communicating with the New Relic platform. Check the service stats section in the file with the latest timestamp in `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots`. All six items in that list should say OK. If they don't, review the logs for more info or reach out to [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com). You can also see the [standard firewall documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/).


If you have configured your firewall correctly, check the following:

  * **The level of efficiency for your application:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the summary section. If IAST analysis coverage is low for your application, add more test cases to your application to get a higher level of testing efficiency.
    
  * **The IAST coverage:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and click to view the summary section. Under the summary section, check if IAST analysis coverage is high and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

  * **Your application is secure:** In this case, check your IAST analysis coverage in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the summary section. If IAST Analysis coverage is 100% and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

  * **Your web socket connection is broken:** Please check the latest log file in your `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots/` folder, and look for the `Service stats -> websocket` line. The expected value is OK.

  * Your application's framework or vulnerability category isn't supported. 

  After checking these, if you don't see vulnerabilities in IAST, please contact [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/) and share your application's configuration and logs with our support team.
