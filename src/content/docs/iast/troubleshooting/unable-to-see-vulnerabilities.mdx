## Problem
You can see your application in the New Relic UI and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in the UI.

## Solution

If this is a new app, firewalls could be preventing it from communicating with the New Relic platform. In the file with the latest timestamp in `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots`, check the **service stats** section. All six items in that list should say OK. If they don't, review the logs for more info or reach out to [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com). For more information, refer the [standard firewall documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/).


If you have configured your firewall correctly, check the following:

  * **The level of efficiency for your application:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the **Summary** section. If IAST analysis coverage is low for your application, add more test cases to your application to get a higher level of testing efficiency.
    
  * **The IAST coverage:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and click to view the **Summary** section. Under the summary section, check if IAST analysis coverage is high and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

  * **Your application is secure:** In this case, check your **IAST Analysis coverage** in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the **Summary** section. If **IAST Analysis coverage** is 100% and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

  * **Your web socket connection is broken:** Check the latest log file in your `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots/` folder, and look for the `Service stats -> websocket` line. The expected value is OK.

  * Your application's framework or vulnerability category isn't supported. 

  After checking these, if you don't see vulnerabilities in IAST, contact [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/) and share your application's configuration and logs with our support team.
