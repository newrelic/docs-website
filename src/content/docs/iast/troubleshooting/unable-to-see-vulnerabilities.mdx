## Problem
you can see your application in the New Relic UI and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in the UI.

## Solution

 <Callout variant="important">
If this is a new app, firewalls could be preventing it from communicating with the NR platform. Check the service stats section in the file with the latest timestamp in `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots`. All 6 items in that list should say OK. If they don't, review the logs for additional info or reach out to [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com). You can also see the [standard firewall documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/).
</Callout>

If you have configured your firewall correctly, check the following:

    - **The level of efficiency for your application:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the summary section. If IAST coverage is low for your application, add additional test cases to your application to get a higher level of testing efficiency.
    
    - **The IAST coverage:** Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and click on it. Under the summary section, check if IAST analysis coverage is high and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

    - Your application's framework or vulnerability category is not supported. 

    If after checking these, you don't see vulnerabilities in IAST, please, contact [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/).
