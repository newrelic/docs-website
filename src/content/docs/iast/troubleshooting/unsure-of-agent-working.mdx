## Problem

I can see my application in the IAST UI and the security agent started successfully but I am not sure if IAST is working properly.


## Solution


    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>.

    2. Search for your application in the <DNT>**Application tests**</DNT> tab and click on it.

    3. View the details of the test including <DNT>**APIs covered**</DNT>, <DNT>**methods calls**</DNT>, and <DNT>**application testing efficiency**</DNT>.

    Also, if you set the log level to <DNT>**debug/finest**</DNT>, you can search for <DNT>**Fuzz request received**</DNT> in the `nr-security-home/logs/java-security-collector.log` file. This shows that the IAST analysis is in progress.
