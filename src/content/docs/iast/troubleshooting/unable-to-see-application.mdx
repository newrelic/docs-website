## Problem

I don't see my application in the New Relic UI.



## Solution

If you don't see your application in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > All Tests**</DNT>, check the following:
    
* that your application is up and running. Check the application process or the [APM & Services page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/view-events-their-products#products)
* the application's logs to find out if there's a problem
* the version of your APM agent and update it if needed
* that the `newrelic.yml` config file includes the modification of the parameters as indicated on the [install page](/docs/iast/install)
* the `nr-security-home/logs` directory and find the `[SETP-8]` line in the `LANGUAGE-security-collector-init.log` file. Check if there is an unexpected error and check what failed
* that the application has traffic. Generate some traffic to allow IAST to test your application
* if a proxy or firewall is blocking access. Whitelist the following IPs `3.134.136.130, 18.219.177.104, 18.117.21.106` for the domain <DNT>**csec.nr-data.net**</DNT>, the following IPs `3.130.22.102, 3.138.243.136, 3.139.218.150` for the domain <DNT>**csec-gov.nr-data.net**</DNT> and the following IPs `18.185.235.118, 3.125.193.113, 3.75.166.122` for the domain <DNT>**csec.eu01.nr-data.net**</DNT>. But our recommendation is to add domains to the whitelist instead of the IPs as these IPs are bound to change anytime
* that the TLS certificate is correct. Add Let's Encrypt CA certificate (download from [Let's Encrypt Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#root-certificates)) to your local trust store. Include both the root certificates and the intermediate ones (ISRG Root X1 & Let's Encrypt R3) to establish the complete chain of trust
* that your application's framework or vulnerability category is supported

## Cause

Possible reasons for not finding your application in the New Relic UI are:

* A wrong version of the APM agent
* IAST flags are disabled
* Proxy or firewall blocking access
* Wrong TLS certificate
* Lack of traffic on the application
* Any unexpected error
