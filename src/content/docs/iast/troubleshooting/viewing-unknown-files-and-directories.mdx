## Problem

I see unknown files and directories in my application directory and want to remove these.

## Solution

If your application has the functionality to create files and directories as part of serving an HTTP request, IAST will try to test the code path and hence, create such files and directories. 
The application code, under the influence of incoming HTTP requests, creates these files. The agent can't delete them.

If you're sure that none of your APIs can create files and directories, share your application's configuration and logs with [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com).
