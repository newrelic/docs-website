## Problem

Your application is not stable during high traffic and you are facing latency issue.

## Solution

Your application may show some latency for some time as part of IAST during high traffic. This should resolve within a few minutes when it finishes the IAST test.

You can also check the snapshot log file in the `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots` folder. The log file shows you the status of the security agent, resource usage, and the last five errors.
