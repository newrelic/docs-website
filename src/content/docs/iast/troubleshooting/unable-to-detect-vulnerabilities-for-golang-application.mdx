## Problem

You don't see any vulnerability for your Golang application.

## Solution

- For Golang, ensure that you imported the required instrumentation packages of libraries and frameworks.

    For example, your application is using libraries for [Mongo DB](http://go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo). For this specific library, you need to import this [instrumentation package](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent/tree/main/instrumentation/csec_mongodb_mongo) from newrelic:
    
    ```
    import (
        "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrsecurityagent"
        "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
        "github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent/instrumentation/csec_mongodb_mongo"
        "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"               
    )
    ```

    Depending on you application requierement, you might have to import additional packages. Check [list of supported packages](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent#instrumentation-packages).

    Also, Make sure you imported the corresponding [<InlinePopover type="apm" /> package](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent?tab=readme-ov-file#service-frameworks) for each module.

    - For HTTP protocol endpoint, use the following `newrelic.WrapListen` function to enable vulnerability scanning against the endpoint:

    ```
    http.ListenAndServe(newrelic.WrapListen(":<YOUR PORT NUMBER>"), nil)
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
        You can skip this step if you're on a Linux environment.
    </Callout>

    - For a specific case of <DNT>**Outbound HTTP Request**</DNT> or calls to external services, you need to [update your application method](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/instrument-go-segments/#go-external-segments).
