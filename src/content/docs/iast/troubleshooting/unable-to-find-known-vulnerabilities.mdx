## Problem

I tested an application with known vulnerabilities, but IAST couldn't detect any vulnerability.


## Solution

IAST starts testing when it detects some traffic, so check if your application starts or has any traffic directed at it. Perform the app's UI or API endpoints. 
Also, IAST requires restarting the application after it's enabled.


Ensure that you are using a [supported application framework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents-products/) and the [latest instrumentation package](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent#instrumentation-packages) for your application. 


## Cause

These are the possible reasons IAST isn't detecting any known vulnerabilities:

    - IAST doesn't support application framework.

    - There is no instrumentation for the module.

    - The agent hasn't been restarted after IAST has been installed or configured.

    - No traffic is detected.
