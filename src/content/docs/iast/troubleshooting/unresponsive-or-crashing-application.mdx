## Problem

After enabling IAST for your APM agent, your application becomes unresponsive and the application crashes.


## Solution

IAST analysis can expose uncaught errors or exceptions in your application.
If the application has crashed due to lack of resources, increase the resources, restart the application, and perform IAST again.

## Cause

As a part of IAST, the security agent sends new requests to the application that increases the load, resulting in an increase in resource usage.
