When your application has exploitable vulnerabilities, it means that someone could take advantage of a misconfiguration to access sensitive information. To help prevent that, install our interactive applications security testing (IAST).

You can use IAST to test applications written in the following languages:
- Java
- NodeJS
- Go

## Test your application [#install]

<Callout variant="important">
  Run IAST with non-production deployments only to avoid exposing vulnerabilities on your production software.

  IAST tests your applications for any exploitable vulnerability by replaying the generated HTTP request with vulnerable payloads.
</Callout>

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**, and click **Start trial**.
2. Read the pre-release software terms, and click **Accept** if you agree to them.
3. On the left hand-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Install**.
4. In the installation window, select the language of your application and complete the steps.

    <figcaption>
        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Install**.
    </figcaption>

5. After you've installed your application, use the APIs from your application so that New Relic can start looking for exploitable vulnerabilities. You can do so by running your own tests against your APIs.
6. Once you've completed all the steps, click **See your data** to see an overview of your tested applications.

## Manage exploitable vulnerabilities for an application [#app-vuln]

To manage exploitable vulnerabilities for a specific application, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Applications**.
2. Under **Tested applications**, search for your application or select it.
3. In the **Application vulnerabilities** tab, see all the exploitable vulnerabilities found in your application. 
    <img

## Fix untested applications [#untested-apps]

If you have an application in New Relic that hasn't been tested for exploitable vulnerabilities, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**.
2. Under **Protect untested applications**, select the application you want to test or click **See all** to search for it.
3. From the **Untested applications** table, select the application you want to test.
    <img
        title="Untested applications table"
        alt="Untested applications table"
        src={iastUntestedApps}

        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Protect untested applications** > **See all**.
    </figcaption>

4. In the **Enable IAST** window, follow the steps to update your application configuration so it can be tested for exploitable vulnerabilities.
    <img
        title="Enable IAST for your untested application"
        alt="Enable IAST for your untested application"

## See the exploitable vulnerabilities coverage for all your applications [#coverage]

In **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Coverage**, you can see how many of your applications have or haven't been tested for exploitable vulnerabilities, as well as an overview of the health of all your applications.

If you see an application under **Untested applications** that you want to test for exploitable vulnerabilities, click **Set up IAST** to [fix the untested application](#untested-apps).

## Query all vulnerabilities in an application [#query-vuln]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **Query Your Data**, and run the following NRQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Vulnerability WHERE issueType = 'Application Vulnerability' AND appId = {MY_APP_ID} 
```

## Troubleshooting 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser

    title="I don't see my application in IAST"
    >
    If you don't see your application in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**, make sure that the application has started and then, review your application's logs for further information.

    <Collapser

    title="I'm not sure the security agent is working"
    >

    In the `nr-security-home/logs` directory, search for the file called `LANGUAGE-security-collector-init.log`. Replace `LANGUAGE` in the path with the one you used, and make sure these steps work for you:

    1. If the security agent started, you'll see this message in your application `stdout`:
        ```shell
        This application instance is now being scanned by New Relic Security under id {{UUID}}
        ```
    2. The security agent generates a unique identifier. For web socket connection, you'll see Node auth headers.
    3. The security agent gathers information about your application.
    4. The web socket connection to SaaS validator is established successfully.
    5. The security agent threads are started.
    6. The application instrumentation is successful.
    7. The application receives and applies your policies and configuration.
    8. You see a first event sent for validation, which means the security agent started successfully.

    title="I'm not sure IAST is looking for vulnerabilities"
    >
    Currently, IAST shows findings only.

    In order to see the IAST analysis in progress, if you've set the `loglevel` to `debug`, search for `Fuzz request received` in the `nr-security-home/logs/java-security-collector.log` file.
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="no-vuln"
    title="I don't see vulnerabilities in IAST"
    >
    If you see your application in New Relic and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**, that could be due to:

    - Your application not being vulnerable.
    - Your web socket connection being broken.
    - Your application's framework or vulnerability category not being supported.

    If you're not sure why this is happening, share your application's configuration and logs with our support team at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

    Snapshot log files are in the `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots` folder. The log file shows you the status of the security agent, resource usage, and the last five errors.
