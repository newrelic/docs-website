## I don't see my application in New Relic

Confirm that the application has started and then review the application's logs for further information.

## How do I make sure that the security agent is working?

In the application's `stdout` you will see this message:

```shell
This application instance is now being scanned by New Relic Security under id {{UUID}}
```

In the `nr-security-home/logs` directory, search for the file called `java-security-collector-init.log`, replace `java` in the path depending on language you used, and make sure these steps work for you:

1. The security agent is starting.
2. It generates a unique identifier. For web socket connection, you'll see Node auth headers.
3. The agent gathers information about your application.
4. The web socket connection to SaaS validator is established successfully.
5. The security agent threads are started.
6. The application instrumentation is successful.
7. The application receives and applies your policies and configuration.
8. You see a first event sent for validation, which means the security agent started successfully.

## How do I know IAST is working?

Currently, IAST shows findings only. Before this feature is publicly available, the New Relic UI will be updated to show progress as well. 

If you have set the `loglevel` to `debug`, you can search for `Fuzz request received` in the `nr-security-home/logs/java-security-collector.log` file. That shows that IAST analysis is in progress.

## I don't see vulnerabilities in New Relic

If you see your application in New Relic and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in New Relic, that could be due to:

- Your application not being vulnerable.
- Your web socket connection being broken.
- Your application's framework or vulnerability category not being supported.

If you're not sure why this is happening, share your application's configuration and logs with our support team at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## I'm facing application stability issues during IAST testing

Snapshot log files are in the `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots` folder. The log file shows you the status of the security agent, resource usage, and the last five errors.
