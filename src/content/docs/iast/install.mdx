<Callout variant="important">
  Run IAST with non-production deployments only. IAST tests the application by invoking HTTP requests with an exploit payload. You must use IAST in non-production environments with only simulated data to avoid both data corruption and introducing exploits into your live code. In addition, when you run IAST on new code in pre-production, you catch potential vulnerabilities before they go live.
</Callout>

    ## Configuration File Settings
    Make sure your `newrelic.yml` config file is updated as follows:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="config-file-example"
        title={<><InlineCode>newrelic.yml</InlineCode> config file</>}
      >
        ```yml
        security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="config-eu-file-example"
        title={<><InlineCode>newrelic.yml</InlineCode> config file for EU</>}
      >
        ```yml
        security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true
            validator_service_url: wss://csec.eu01.nr-data.net
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="config-file-fed-example"
        title={<><InlineCode>newrelic.yml</InlineCode> config file for Fed users</>}
      >
        ```yml
        security:
            enabled: true
            agent:
                enabled: true

## Install New Relic IAST

There are primarily five stages involved in successful installation of IAST:

1. [Safety Check](#safety-check)
2. [Selection of Application Language](#selection-of-application-language)
3. [Updating the APM Agent](#updating-the-apm-agent)
4. [Setting up the Security Agent](#setting-up-the-security-agent)
5. [Restart and test the application](#restart-and-test-the-application)

To install New Relic IAST:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST** </DNT> and click <DNT>**Install**</DNT>.

    />
  </Step>

<Step>
    
<Callout variant="important">
  Before you start IAST installation, review the IAST testing steps and how exploitable vulnerabilities are detected. 
  Please, refer: [IAST exploitable vulnerabilities](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/iast/exploitable-vulns/)
</Callout>

## Safety Check

    Make sure IAST should not be run in production environment and click <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.

      alt="IAST Installation Instruction Screen"
      src="/images/iast-install-steps.webp"
    /> 

</Step>
  
  <Step>

## Selection of Application Language

    Select the language of your application and complete the steps. The application languages supported are: Java, Node, and Go.  
    <img
      title="Install New Relic IAST"
      alt="Install New Relic IAST"
      src="/images/iast_screenshot-crop_install.webp"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Once you select the application language, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions and must watch the [relevant application language video](/docs/iast/install/#check-out-these-demo-videos-for-setting-up-iast-with-different-application-languages) for successful installation of IAST.

<Callout variant="caution">
  - You may encounter error if on-screen instructions are not followed properly.
  - You may not be able to generate the traffic for your application if the video instructions for your **selected application language** are not followed. 
</Callout>    

    > The below screen has been shown for Java Application language selected.


## Updating the APM Agent


Update the APM Agent to the latest version. The minimum version supported is: v8.9.0.

To update the Java agent, follow these on-screen [instructions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent/) and verify the agent version after update using the command:

```
java -jar newrelic.jar -v

```
<Callout variant="tip">

  - The above code is for JAVA APM, in your case follow the on-screen instructions as per your application language selected and verify the agent version accordingly.

  </Step>  

  <Step>
    
    ## Setting up the Security Agent

    Setup the Security Agent by enabling the security agent settings:
    
    Set the `security.enabled` and `security.agent.enabled` flag to true in the **newrelic.yml** config file. 

    Make sure the `high_security` in **newrelic.yml** is turned off for the IAST to work.
 
    <img
      title="IAST Full Configuration"
      alt="IAST Full Configuration"
      src="/images/iast-full-configuration.webp"
    />

    The code shown above for **Setup security agent** is the bare minimum requirement to start the IAST. 

    To fully configure the IAST, click on `View security config fields` and copy the **Security Config** Code. Now open the **newrelic.yml** file and paste the copied code below High Security Settings `high_security: false`. 

<Callout variant="tip">
    1. Make sure `high_security: _ _ _ _ _` is set to false.
    2. `yml` is sensitive to indents and spacing, make sure the code pasted in **newrelic.yml** file is lined up underneath the high security settings:


    ```
    high_security: false (Security Settings in newrelic.yml)
    |
    security: (The pasted code beginning from this line underneath high_security)
    # The Copied Code
    ---
    ---
    ```
</Callout>

    </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart and test the application

    To start testing with the IAST agent, restart your application and generate traffic against your applicationâ€™s APIs. Click <DNT>**See your data**</DNT> to see an overview of your tested application.

    />
    
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The below screen will show IAST test results as per your configurations.
