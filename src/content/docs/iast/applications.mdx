The applications page informs you about the total number of found vulnerabilities in your tested applications and the number of untested applications you have. You can always add untested applications to the New Relic IAST capability. Keep in mind that each application test is a build of an application. Each time your pre-production environment deploys a new build and exercises a new test, it will show up with that application name. For each test run, we show the application name, account, status, exploit count, test efficiency, and the last time the application was tested. You can sort by application name to see all test runs of an application together to quickly compare their status.

## Details and remediation of an application [#remediation-app]

## Enable New Relic IAST [#enable-iast]

Enable IAST on your untested applications to monitor, test, and remediate security risks across the SDLC at scale. It will also help you ship code faster. To enable IAST:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Tests & Applications**</DNT> on the left navigation pane.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click on the <DNT>**All applications**</DNT> tab and check the <DNT>**IAST supported**</DNT> column to make sure the application is supported. Select the application you want to enable IAST.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the <DNT>**Enable IAST**</DNT> window, follow the steps to update your application configuration, so you can test it for exploitable vulnerabilities.
