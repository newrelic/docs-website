    If this is a new app, firewalls could be preventing it from communicating with the NR platform. Check the service stats section in the file with the latest timestamp in `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots`. All 6 items in that list should say OK. If they don't, review the logs for additional info or reach out to [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com). You can also see the [standard firewall documentation](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/networks/).

    If you can see your application in the New Relic UI and the security agent successfully started IAST, but you don't see vulnerabilities in the UI, check the following:

    * The level of efficiency for your application: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and check the summary section. If IAST coverage is low for your application, add additional test cases to your application to get a higher level of testing efficiency.

    * The IAST coverage: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>. Search for your application and click on it. Under the summary section, check if IAST analysis coverage is high and no vulnerabilities are detected, that means your application is secure.

    * Your application's framework or vulnerability category is not supported.

      If after checking these, you're still not seeing vulnerabilities in IAST, please, contact [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com/s/).

    If you don't see your application in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>, check the following:

    * Your application is up and running: Check the application process or the [APM & Services page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/view-events-their-products#products).
    * The application's logs to find out if there's a problem.
    * The version of your APM agent and udpate it if needed.
    * The `newrelic.yml` config file includes the modification of the parameters as indicated on the [install page](/docs/iast/install).
    * Go to the `nr-security-home/logs` directory and find the `[SETP-8]` line in the `LANGUAGE-security-collector-init.log` file. Check if there is an unexpected error and know what failed.
    * The application has traffic. Generate some traffic to allow IAST to test your application.
    * Proxy or Firewall blocking access. Whitelist the following IPs `3.134.136.130, 18.219.177.104, 18.117.21.106` for the domain <DNT>**csec.nr-data.net**</DNT>, the following IPs `3.130.22.102, 3.138.243.136, 3.139.218.150` for the domain <DNT>**csec-gov.nr-data.net**</DNT> and the following IPs `18.185.235.118, 3.125.193.113, 3.75.166.122` for the domain <DNT>**csec.eu01.nr-data.net**</DNT>. But our recommendation is to add domains in the whitelist instead of the IPs as these IPs are bound to change anytime.
    * The TLS Certificate is correct. Add Let's Encrypt CA certificate (download from [Let's Encrypt Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#root-certificates)) to your local trust store. Include both the root certificates and the intermediate ones (ISRG Root X1 & Let's Encrypt R3) to establish the complete chain of trust.
    * Your application's framework or vulnerability category is supported.

    When the security agent is working correctly:

    * You see your application in <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>. The application is started and there is traffic generated.
    * In the `nr-security-home/logs` directory, search for the `LANGUAGE-security-collector-init.log` file. Replace `LANGUAGE` in the filename with the one you are using. Search for these steps to see where the problem is:

      * [STEP-1]&#x3A; The security agent is starting.
      * [STEP-2]&#x3A; The security agent generates a unique identifier. For web socket connection, you'll see Node auth headers.
      * [STEP-3]&#x3A; The security agent gathers information about your application.
      * [STEP-4]&#x3A; The web socket connection to SaaS validator is established successfully.
      * [STEP-5]&#x3A; The security agent threads started.
      * [STEP-6]&#x3A; The application instrumentation is successful.
      * [STEP-7]&#x3A; The application receives and applies your policies and configuration.
      * [STEP-8]&#x3A; You see a first event sent for validation, which means the security agent started successfully.

    You can check if IAST is working, even if you're seeing your application in the IAST UI and the security agent started successfully. Follow these steps for checking it:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>.

    2. Search for your application in the <DNT>**Application tests**</DNT> tab and click on it.

    3. View the details of the test including <DNT>**APIs covered**</DNT>, <DNT>**methods calls**</DNT>, and <DNT>**application testing efficiency**</DNT>.

       Also, if you set the log level to <DNT>**debug/finest**</DNT>, you can search for <DNT>**Fuzz request received**</DNT> in the `nr-security-home/logs/java-security-collector.log` file. This shows that the IAST analysis is in progress.

    IAST starts testing when detects that there is traffic, so check if your application works out or has any traffic directed at it. Perform the app's UI or API endpoints.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tested-app"
    title="I tested an application with known vulnerabilities, but IAST didn't find it"

    These can be the reasons if IAST doesn't detect known vulnerabilities:

    * IAST doesn't support application framework.

    * There is no instrumentation for the module.

    Your application may show high traffic and latency for some time as part of IAST. This should resolve in a few minutes when it finishes the IAST test.

    You can also check the snapshot log file in the `nr-security-home/logs/snapshots` folder. The log file shows you the status of the security agent, resource usage, and the last five errors.

  <Collapser
    id="unknown-files"
    title="I see unknown files and directories in my application directory"
  >
    If your application has the functionality to create files and directories as part of serving an HTTP request, IAST will try to test the code path and hence, create such files and directories. The application code, under the influence of incoming HTTP requests, creates these files. The agent can't deleted them.

    If you're sure that none of your APIs can create files and directories, share your application's configuration and logs with [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="not-responding"
    title="My application isn't responding or crashed"
  >
    As a part of IAST, the security agent sends new requests to the application that increases the load, resulting in an increase of resource utilization. This IAST analysis can also expose uncaught errors or exceptions in your application.

    If the application has crashed due to lack of resources, increase the resources, restart the application, and perform IAST again.

  <Collapser
    id="query-vulns-nrdb"
    title="Can I query all vulnerabilities in the application from NRDB?"
  >
    You can update the `appId` in the below query and run it in the query builder to find all the vulnerabilities reported for your application.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Vulnerability WHERE issueType = 'Application Vulnerability' AND appId = '{your application's appId}'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="false-positive"
    title="I see a vulnerability that is not an actual vulnerability (false positive)"
  >
    Update the status of your vulnerability if you think IAST has reported a false positive. Follow these steps:

    * Search your application: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST > Tests**</DNT>.

    * Click on the all applications tab and select the vulnerability that is not an actual vulnerability.

    * Under the vulnerability details section, you can update the vulnerability status for the reported vulnerability. You can update its status to:
      * False positive
      * Resolved
      * Unresolved

    * If you want to list out the vulnerabilities for which you updated the status, you can apply the filter in the detected exploitable vulnerabilities list.

  <Collapser
    id="golang-vuln"
    title="No vulnerabilities detected for my Golang application"
  >
    * For Golang, make sure that you imported the required instrumentation packages for the libraries and frameworks that your application uses.

      For instance, let's suppose that your application is using libraries for [Mongo DB](http://go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo). For this specific library, you need to import this [instrumentation package](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent/tree/main/instrumentation/csec_mongodb_mongo) from newrelic:

      ```
      import (
          "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrsecurityagent"
          "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
          "github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent/instrumentation/csec_mongodb_mongo"
          "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"               
      )
      ```

      Depending on you application requierement, there're other packages that you may need to import. Check [here](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent#instrumentation-packages) the list of supported packages.

      Make sure you imported the corresponding [<InlinePopover type="apm"/> package](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent?tab=readme-ov-file#service-frameworks) for each module.

    * If you're opening an HTTP protocol endpoint, place the `newrelic.WrapListen` function around the endpoint name to enable vulnerability scanning against that endpoint:

      ```
      http.ListenAndServe(newrelic.WrapListen(":<YOUR PORT NUMBER>"), nil)
      ```

      <Callout variant="important">
        You can skip this step if you're on a Linux environment.
      </Callout>

    * For a specific case of <DNT>**Outbound HTTP Request**</DNT> or calls to external services, you need to [update your application method](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/instrument-go-segments/#go-external-segments).

  <Collapser
    id="iast-windows"
    title="Is IAST supported for the Windows environment?"
  >
    IAST is supported for the Windows environment. However, for some Java application, you may face `classCirculatoryError` and need to disable low priority instrumentation in the agent configuration as follows:

    * Disable low-priority-instrumentation from security config:

      ```
      low-priority-instrumentation:
          enabled: false
      ```

    * Exclude low-priority-instrumentation class from the class transformer. To do this, add the given lines in the `class_transformer` section of the config file:

      ```
      com.newrelic.instrumentation.security.low-priority-instrumentation:
          enabled: false
      ```

  <Collapser
    id="apis-available"
    title="Are there any APIs available to download IAST findings?"
  >
    No, we don't have any APIs to download IAST findings.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="iast-not-prod"
    title="Why should IAST not be used in production?"
  >
    IAST sends new requests to the application based on what it observes during testing. The goal is to determine if malicious behaviors are possible which involves invoking additional API and method calls using an exploit payload. This can result in undesirable manipulation of customer data and triggering of runtime protection services.
