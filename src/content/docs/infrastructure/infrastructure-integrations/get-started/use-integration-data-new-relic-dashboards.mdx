Most data generated by integrations is available in [our dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), where you can query your data using [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK.

For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see [New Relic data types](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/).

## Get started with integration data [#insights-tips]

Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic:

* From the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Third-party services** page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can [view the NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts#functions) that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the [example queries](#query-examples).
* Use [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) or the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to explore and understand the available data.
* Read the [docs for a specific integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/types-integrations) to learn about the reported data.
* At the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), when you create a useful query you'd like to add to your dashboards, select **Add to dashboard**.

## Example NRQL queries [#nrql]

Learn how to build NRQL queries in our [Intro to NRQL docs](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql).

Here are some examples of [NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) that use integration data:

<CollapserGroup id="query-examples">
  <Collapser
    id="aws-ebs-example"
    title="AWS EBS query example"
  >
    Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by `entityName`:

    ```
    SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="azure-service-example"
    title="Azure Service Bus query example"
  >
    Here's a NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group:

    ```
    SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="azure-functions-example"
    title="Azure Functions query example"
  >
    Here's a NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time:

    ```
    SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="azure-vms-example"
    title="Azure VMs query example"
  >
    Here's a NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago:

    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nginx-example"
    title="NGINX query example"
  >
    Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in a dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time:

    ```
    SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES
    ```

    For more on how to create queries, see [NRQL reference](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/).

  <Collapser
    id="mysql-example"
    title="MySQL query example"
  >
    Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections:

    ```
    SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample
    ```

    For more on how to create queries, see [NRQL reference](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/).

  <Collapser
    id="inventory-change-example"
    title="Inventory change query example"

    Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change:

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

  You can also perform these queries [using dimensional metrics](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql).

## Tips for using different data types [#data-types]

Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data. For more on using NRQL queries, see our [Intro to NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql).

    Tips for finding and using integration metric data:

    * All integration data is attached to [a data type known as an event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) (not to be confused with [events reported by integrations](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#events), which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer). For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see [New Relic data collection](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data).
    * Metric values are treated as **attributes**: key-value pairs attached to an [event](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#event-data). For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the `connectionsActive` attribute of the `MysqlSample` event.

      For general information about metrics, see [Integration metric data](#metric).

  <Collapser
    id="event-tips"
    title="Event data tips"
  >
    Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data when querying:

    * Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an `InfrastructureEvent` with a `format` value of `inventoryChange`.
    * Integration data can be found via [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).

      For general information about events, see [Event data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).

      After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
    </Callout>

    When inventory data changes, an `InfrastructureEvent` event type is generated with a `format` value of `inventoryChange`. See the [query examples](#inventory-change-example) for an example of querying this data.

    For general information about inventory data, see [Integration inventory data](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/understand-use-data-infrastructure-integrations).
