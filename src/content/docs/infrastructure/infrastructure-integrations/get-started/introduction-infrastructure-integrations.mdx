New Relic offers various [integrations and quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/) for reporting data to our platform. One category of integrations is our Infrastructure integrations.

## Types of infrastructure integrations [#integration-types]

New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host.

### Cloud integrations

Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account.

<table id="overview">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        **Integrations**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="aws-cloud">
      <td>
        [Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list)
      </td>

      <td>
        Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic.

        See the list of [AWS integrations](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="azure-cloud">
      <td>
        [Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list)
      </td>

      <td>
        Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic.

        See the list of [Azure integrations](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="google-cloud">
      <td>
        [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list)
      </td>

      <td>
        Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic.

        See the list of [GCP integrations](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### On-host integrations

On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        **Integrations**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Kubernetes integration](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/getting-started/getting-started)
      </td>

      <td>
        Connect your account to [gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data), [explore your clusters](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), and [manage alerts](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/understand-use-data#alerts).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="on-host">
      <td>
        [On-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/)
      </td>

      <td>
        Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="custom-on-host">
      <td>
        [Build your own](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration)
      </td>

      <td>
        To create your own lightweight integration, use our [Flex integration tool](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Install instructions [#installation-instructions]

To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see:

* **Cloud integrations**: [AWS procedures](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-services-infrastructure), [Azure procedures](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations), [Google Cloud Platform procedures](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure)
* **Kubernetes**: [Kubernetes procedures](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration)
* **On-host integrations**: See an [integration's documentation](/docs/integrations/host-integrations) for install procedures

## Features [#whats-next]

After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can:

* [Filter and analyze](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) the metrics and configuration data in [our Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure).
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and create custom charts and dashboards.
* [Create alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) to monitor problems with your services' performance.
* For cloud integrations, configure [data collection settings](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

## Types of integration data [#data-types]

Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can [use in New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Integration data
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr id="metrics">
      <td>
        Metrics
      </td>

      <td>
        Numeric measurement data. Examples:

        * Number of requests in a queue
        * Number of hits on a database per minute
        * Percentage of CPU being used

        Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="inventory">
      <td>
        Inventory
      </td>

      <td>
        Live system state and configuration information. Examples:

        * Host name
        * AWS region or availability zone
        * Port being used

        Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="events">
      <td>
        Events
      </td>

      <td>
        Important activity on a system. Examples:

        * Service starting
        * Version update
        * New table being created

        Changes to inventory are a type of event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples:

        * Certain inventory data
        * Additional data attached to events
        * Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory

        Depending on the integration, [other types of information](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/) may be reported as attributes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).
