A [New Relic infrastructure integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) provides you with a dashboard containing several data charts. This document explains where the data comes from and what you can do with dashboards and charts.

## Integration dashboards [#about]

New Relic infrastructure integrations come with pre-built dashboards with metrics and inventory data from the monitored service.

To find your dashboards: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** and look for your service. Most on-host integrations (like NGINX, Redis, MySQL) are under **Third party services**.

Behind the scenes, integration charts are generated by [NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) of integration data. Every chart includes an option to view and edit the NRQL query associated with it.

## Chart functions [#functions]

To see the options available for a data chart, hover over a chart and select the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
icon. Options include:

* **Add to dashboard**: adds to an existing dashboard or a new one.
* **View query**: displays the [NRQL query](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) that generated that chart.
* **Get as image**: presents a publicly accessible URL for sharing the chart as an image.
