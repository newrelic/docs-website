Each cloud account you link to New Relic infrastructure monitoring (for example, [AWS](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure) or [Azure](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations)) has an **account status dashboard** that shows how our platform is handling data from that cloud service provider.

## Why it matters [#reasons-to-use]

Reasons to monitor this dashboard include:

* **Understand API call usage.** We use cloud APIs to collect metrics and inventory data. The dashboards show counts and frequencies for those API calls. You may want to monitor these for two reasons: API calls can cost money, and your API usage may be throttled at certain usage levels. To decrease usage, you can [configure integration settings](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) to reduce the number of components you monitor or how frequently they're monitored.
* **Troubleshoot missing data or other data issues.** The dashboard displays information that affects how integrations report data, including:
  * Errors that affect New Relic collecting data, like permission errors or quota exhaustion errors.
  * Changes to integration configuration, like polling interval changes, or tag-collection being disabled or enabled.

## Understand dashboard data [#understand-data]

The specific data displayed on the account status dashboard will differ by cloud service provider. Common charts include:

* **Data updates**: Shows updates to metric data or inventory data (updates shown as a `1` value).
* **Account changes**: Actions affecting how the integration works. For example: renaming or unlinking a cloud account, changing polling intervals, and other configuration options.
* **Data freshness**: Timestamp of the last data point collected for each integration.
* **Fetching errors**: These indicate issues with collecting data. (This may be a problem on the cloud-provider side.)

Options for better understanding chart data include:

* Mouse over a chartâ€™s <Icon name="fe-help-circle"/>
  icon to see a chart description (if available).
* [View the chart's underlying NRQL query](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform).

## Find account status dashboard [#find-dashboard]

To find the account status dashboard for a cloud service provider:

1. From **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**, and select a cloud service provider (for example, **AWS**).
2. Select **Account status dashboard** for the cloud account.
