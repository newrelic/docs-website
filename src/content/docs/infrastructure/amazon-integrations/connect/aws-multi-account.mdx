The New Relic UI gives you a complete view of your AWS system, making monitoring much easier. You can view metrics and monitor multiple AWS accounts that send metrics to a single account linked to New Relic. For this feature to work, you must send metrics from different AWS accounts that you want to monitor to a single AWS account. You can then monitor those different AWS accounts with the metrics enriched with the appropriate tags and metadata. You can easily track [performance metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/) while reducing overall infrastructure [costs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/), which means you'll save time and money.

Having a single view of all your AWS accounts helps you:

* Reduce the number of friction points by setting up a single observe account for AWS.

* Reduce overall infrastructure costs by reducing the number of streams sending metrics to observability solutions.

* Get tagged and metadata-enriched metrics from your AWS accounts.

## Before you start [#before-start]

Check the following:

* You've configured [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to send metrics to a single AWS account that must be connected to New Relic.

* You're using [AWS Resource Groups Tagging API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html) to collect tags.

* You're using AWS config to collect metadata.

* All IAM roles have access to fetch tags from individual accounts.

* You use the [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) used in the AWS observe account on all AWS accounts to monitor.

## Connect your AWS observe account to New Relic [#connect-aws-account]

To start receiving Amazon data with New Relic AWS integrations, connect your AWS account, which receives metrics from all the other AWS accounts you want to monitor, to New Relic.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT>. Under the <DNT>**Integrations**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**AWS**</DNT>.

2. Click <DNT>**Add AWS account**</DNT>.

3. Choose <DNT>**Manually integrate your AWS account**</DNT> intrumentation method.

4. Choose the <DNT>**Real-time AWS monitoring (Recommended)**</DNT> option.

5. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and follow the steps.

6. Once you finish all the steps, click the <DNT>**Explore data**</DNT> link to check out your metrics.

## Explore your AWS data [#explore-data]

To explore your AWS data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT>. Under the <DNT>**Integrations**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**AWS**</DNT>. Then, select your integration and click the <DNT>**Explore data**</DNT> link. This link opens the <DNT>[**Data explorer**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/)</DNT> to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions. You also have a tab to open the [query builder](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/).

## Check the status of your account [#account-status]

You can check the status of your account by clicking the <DNT>**See account status dashboard**</DNT> button.
