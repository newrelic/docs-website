The [AWS European Sovereign Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/eu/sovereign-cloud/) is designed to help European organizations meet stringent data residency and operational sovereignty requirements. It is an independent AWS cloud located within the European Union, with operational autonomy and resiliency exclusively in Europe. This sovereign cloud helps customers comply with European regulations such as GDPR, NIS2, and DORA while leveraging AWS services.

New Relic provides you with the confidence to deploy your services on AWS European Sovereign Cloud, allowing you to monitor and observe your entire ecosystem from [our platform](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

## Integration methods [#integration-methods]

AWS European Sovereign Cloud supports both integration methods:

* **Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams (Recommended)**: Stream metrics from your AWS services to New Relic in near real-time. This is the recommended approach for most services. See [Set up CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integration-for-metrics/via-cloudformation-cwms) for setup instructions.

* **API Polling**: Required only for the following services that don't support CloudWatch Metric Streams:
  * [AWS Billing](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-billing-monitoring-integration)
  * [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-cloudtrail-monitoring-integration)
  * [AWS Health](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-health-monitoring-integration)
  * [AWS Trusted Advisor](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-trusted-advisor-integration)
  * [AWS X-Ray](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-x-ray-monitoring-integration)

If you utilize other AWS services alongside any of these, you can still use CloudWatch Metric Streams as your primary integration method. During setup, New Relic provides the option to configure API polling specifically for these unsupported services.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can use Terraform to automate the process of enabling cloud integrations. Read how in the [Terraform official documentation site](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/cloud_integrations_guide).

## Requirements [#requirements]

* You must have [your AWS account connected to New Relic](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure) before connecting AWS European Sovereign Cloud.
* If you're using our [AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/introduction-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda): our `newrelic-log-ingestion` is not deployed in the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) for AWS European Sovereign Cloud; it must be installed manually. For instructions, see [Enable Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/enable-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda#connect-aws).
* AWS European Sovereign Cloud supports CloudWatch Metric Streams, which enables monitoring of all AWS services that publish metrics to CloudWatch. See the [AWS integrations list](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list) for the full list of supported services.

## Connect AWS European Sovereign Cloud to New Relic

To start receiving Amazon data with New Relic AWS integrations, connect your Amazon account to New Relic.

1. Obtain [your credentials](#eu-sovereign-credentials).
2. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS EU Sovereign Cloud**</DNT>.
3. Click on <DNT>**Add AWS EU Sovereign Cloud account**</DNT>.
4. Give your AWS account a name, provide the credentials to connect your account, and click <DNT>**Submit**</DNT>.
5. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

## How to obtain AWS European Sovereign Cloud credentials for New Relic [#eu-sovereign-credentials]

1. From the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) in your AWS European Sovereign Cloud account, click <DNT>**Add user**</DNT>.
2. For the <DNT>**User name**</DNT>, type <DNT>**NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations**</DNT>. For <DNT>**Select AWS access type**</DNT>, select as <DNT>**Programmatic access**</DNT>.

     <DNT>**AWS IAM console > Add user**</DNT>: add <DNT>**NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations**</DNT> as a user.
   </figcaption>
3. Attach the Policy: Search for <DNT>**ReadOnlyAccess**</DNT>, select the checkbox for the policy named <DNT>**ReadOnlyAccess**</DNT>, then click <DNT>**Next: Tags**</DNT> (adding tags is optional). Alternatively, you can [create your own managed policy](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor.
