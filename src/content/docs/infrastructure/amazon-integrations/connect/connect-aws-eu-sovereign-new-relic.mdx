AWS European (EU) Sovereign Cloud is a new independent AWS Cloud located within the European Union.
New Relic provides monitoring of resources in the EU Sovereign cloud but does NOT store the telemetry data within the EU Sovereign Cloud. They are stored in our existing New Relic EU (non-sovereign) data center.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* A New Relic [Ingest - license key and a User key](https://one.eu.newrelic.com/api-keys): You'll need these keys to connect your AWS services to your New Relic account.
* [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html) to deploy new AWS resources and [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html): You'll need this permission for your AWS account.
* [Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure) for cloud integrations: You'll need these permissions for your New Relic account.
