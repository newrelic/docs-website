[Uninstalling the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/uninstall-infrastructure-agent-or-integrations) doesn't automatically uninstall any of your [infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

To uninstall [AWS Metric Stream](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) or any other AWS integration, follow the steps below.

        Disable AWS CloudWatch metric streams integration

        To disable AWS CloudWatch metric streams integration:

        1. From AWS Console, remove all required resources that were created during AWS integration setup, including any AWS CloudWatch streams, AWS Kinesis Data Firehouse endpoints, and the AWS S3 backup bucket. If you used the AWS CloudFormation template, then follow the steps to [delete a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html).
        2. Complete step 1 for each active AWS region where you connected the AWS CloudWatch metric stream.
        3. In <DoNotTranslate>**Infrastructure > AWS > AWS Status Dashboard**</DoNotTranslate>, make sure no new metric updates are being ingested in New Relic.
        4. Complete the steps to [disconnect the AWS account](#unlink-aws).

        To disable services while keeping your AWS account linked to New Relic:

        1. From <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DoNotTranslate>, select <DoNotTranslate>**AWS > Manage services**</DoNotTranslate>.
        2. From your <DoNotTranslate>**Edit AWS account**</DoNotTranslate> page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable.
        3. Save your changes.

        Disconnect AWS account
      </td>

      <td>
        To disconnect your AWS account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your AWS account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that AWS account.

        1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS > Manage services**</DoNotTranslate>.
        2. From your <DoNotTranslate>**Edit AWS account**</DoNotTranslate> page, select <DoNotTranslate>**Unlink this account**</DoNotTranslate>.
        3. Save your changes.
        4. Sign in to AWS and select [<DoNotTranslate>**Services > IAM > Roles**</DoNotTranslate>](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles).
        5. Select the checkbox for the role you want to delete, then select <DoNotTranslate>**Role Actions > Delete Role**</DoNotTranslate>.

           Unlinking your AWS account will disable the trust relationship set up via your ARN.
