To start receiving Amazon data with [New Relic's AWS integrations](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/introduction-aws-integrations), connect your Amazon account to New Relic. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.

AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in [New Relic's CloudWatch solution](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-cloudwatch-metric-streams/) and [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time/) blog posts.

Follow the [steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/#set-up-metric-stream) to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can use Terraform to automate the process of enabling cloud integrations. Read how in the [Terraform official documentation site](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/cloud_integrations_guide).

## Connect individual AWS integrations to New Relic [#connect]

To connect additional <DoNotTranslate>**API Polling**</DoNotTranslate> integrations to New Relic:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DoNotTranslate>. Click on one of the available service tiles.
2. From the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles), click <DoNotTranslate>**Roles**</DoNotTranslate>, click <DoNotTranslate>**Create role**</DoNotTranslate>, select <DoNotTranslate>**AWS account**</DoNotTranslate>, then select <DoNotTranslate>**Another AWS account**</DoNotTranslate>.

   * For `Account ID`, use `754728514883`.
   * Check the `Require external ID` box.
   * For `External ID`, enter your New Relic account ID.
   * Don't enable the setting to `Require MFA` (multi-factor authentication).
   * Click <DoNotTranslate>**Next**</DoNotTranslate>
3. Attach the <DoNotTranslate>**Policy**</DoNotTranslate>: Search for `ReadOnlyAccess` in the <DoNotTranslate>**Permissions policies**</DoNotTranslate> text box, select the checkbox for the policy named `ReadOnlyAccess`, then click <DoNotTranslate>**Next**</DoNotTranslate>. Alternatively, you can [create your own managed policy](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor.
4. For the <DoNotTranslate>**Role name**</DoNotTranslate>, enter `NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations`, then click <DoNotTranslate>**Create role**</DoNotTranslate>.
5. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the <DoNotTranslate>**Role summary**</DoNotTranslate> page, select and copy the entire <DoNotTranslate>**Role ARN**</DoNotTranslate> (required later in this procedure).
6. Configure a <DoNotTranslate>**Budgets**</DoNotTranslate> policy: While viewing the <DoNotTranslate>**Role summary**</DoNotTranslate> for your new role, open the <DoNotTranslate>**Add permissions**</DoNotTranslate> drop-down and click on <DoNotTranslate>**Create inline policy**</DoNotTranslate>.
7. Open the <DoNotTranslate>**JSON**</DoNotTranslate> tab and add the following permission statement:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "budgets:ViewBudget"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
8. Then click <DoNotTranslate>**Review policy**</DoNotTranslate>. Enter a policy name, for example `NewRelicBudget`, and then select <DoNotTranslate>**Create policy**</DoNotTranslate>.
9. Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role.
10. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then <DoNotTranslate>**Save**</DoNotTranslate>.

It may take few minutes until new resources are detected and synthesized as entities. See Cloud integrations [system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits) for more information.

## Connect multiple AWS integrations [#multiple-integrations]

To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account:

1. If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive <DoNotTranslate>**AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess**</DoNotTranslate> policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy.
2. Follow the instructions to [connect your Amazon account to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/amazon-aws-ec2-integration-infrastructure#connect) .
3. Provide the ARN that contains the <DoNotTranslate>**ReadOnlyAccess**</DoNotTranslate> policy.

Once you complete your setup, you can see your integrations at <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DoNotTranslate>.


## Connect multiple AWS accounts [#connect-mulitple]

By default, the Amazon EC2 <DoNotTranslate>**AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess**</DoNotTranslate> permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to [connect an AWS account](#connect) for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic.

## Add or edit custom tags [#custom-tags]

New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have [custom tags as dimensions](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/#tags-collection).

For API polling integrations, if you don't see any tags within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Click <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> <DoNotTranslate>**Manage services**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed.

Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings.

## Disconnect your AWS integrations [#disconnect]

You can [disable one or more integrations](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-integrations/#uninstall-aws) anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you <DoNotTranslate>**do not**</DoNotTranslate> disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic.

To [uninstall your services completely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/uninstall-infrastructure-agent#unlink-aws) from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account.

## Regional support [#availability]

We don't support [Chinese AWS regions](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/troubleshooting/invalid-principal-error-unsupported-aws-regions).
