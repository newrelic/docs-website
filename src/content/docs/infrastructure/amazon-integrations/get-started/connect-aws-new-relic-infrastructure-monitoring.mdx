To start receiving Amazon data with [New Relic AWS integrations](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/introduction-aws-integrations), connect your Amazon account to New Relic. If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.

## Connect AWS to New Relic [#connect]

<Callout variant="important">
  AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in [New Relic's CloudWatch solution](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-cloudwatch-metric-streams/) and [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time/) blog posts.
</Callout>

Follow the [steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/#set-up-metric-stream) to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics.

To connect additional **API Polling** integrations:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**. Click on one of the available service tiles.
2. From the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles), click **Create role,** then click **Another AWS account**.

   * For `Account ID`, use `754728514883`.
   * Check the `Require external ID` box.
   * For `External ID`, enter your New Relic account ID.
   * **Do not** enable the setting to `Require MFA` (multi-factor authentication).
3. Attach the **Policy**: Search for `ReadOnlyAccess`, select the checkbox for the policy named `ReadOnlyAccess`, then click **Next: Review**. Alternatively, you can [create your own managed policy](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor.
4. For the **Role name**, enter `NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations`, then click **Create role**.
5. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the **Role summary** page, select and copy the entire **Role ARN** (required later in this procedure).
6. Configure a **Budgets** policy: While viewing the **Role summary** for your new role, select **<Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   Add inline policy**.
7. Create a **Custom policy**: Enter a policy name (for example, `NewRelicBudget`), add the following permission statement, and then select **Apply policy**.

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "budgets:ViewBudget"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
8. Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role.
9. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then **Save**.

## Connect multiple AWS integrations [#multiple-integrations]

To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account:

1. If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive **AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess** policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy.
2. Follow the instructions to [connect your Amazon account to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/amazon-aws-ec2-integration-infrastructure#connect) .
3. Provide the ARN that contains the **ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

Once setup is complete, select the integrations you want to monitor:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon.
3. Select the checkbox for each integration you want to monitor.

## Connect multiple AWS accounts [#connect-mulitple]

By default, the Amazon EC2 **AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess** permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to [connect an AWS account](#connect) for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic.

## Add or edit custom tags [#custom-tags]

New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have [custom tags as dimensions](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/#tags-collection).

For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the **Add filter** menu of the **[Filter sets](/docs/scopes-organize-your-infrastructure#create)** sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> icon.
3. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed.

Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings.

## Disconnect your AWS integrations [#disconnect]

You can [disable one or more integrations](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/uninstall-infrastructure-integrations/#uninstall-aws) anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you **do not** disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic.

To [uninstall your services completely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/uninstall-infrastructure-agent#unlink-aws) from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account.

## Regional support [#availability]

China regions are [not supported.](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/troubleshooting/invalid-principal-error-unsupported-aws-regions)
