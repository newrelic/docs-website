For seamless integration of your AWS account with New Relic, [Integration via CloudFormation and CloudWatch metric stream](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integration-for-metrics/via-cloudformation) is the most recommended approach. You can also utilize API Polling for integration with certain data retrieval limitations. For more details, refer to the comparision table in [AWS metrics ingestion](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/#aws-metrics-ingestion). It is recommended to use API Polling only for services not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:
* **A New Relic [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys)**: You'll need a license key to connect your AWS services to your New Relic account.
* **[Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html)** to deploy new AWS resources and **[IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)**: You’ll need this permission for your AWS account.
* **[Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure)** for cloud integrations: You’ll need these permissions for your New Relic account.

## Integration steps [#integration-steps]

To integrate your AWS account with New Relic using CloudFormation and API Polling, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [<DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/cloud-aws).
2. Select the correct account.
3. Click <DNT>**Set up integration**</DNT>.
4. Follow the instructions on each screen, and fill in the fields that apply to you. For this integration, choose the following options in the given screens:

    1. <DNT>**Choose Data type(s)**</DNT>: <DNT>Metrics</DNT>
    2. <DNT>**Choose a setup method**</DNT>: <DNT>Automate AWS with CloudFormation (Recommended)</DNT>
    3. <DNT>**Choose a metrics integration type**</DNT>: <DNT>API Polling</DNT>

5. On the <DNT>**Select services**</DNT> screen, if needed, use the <DNT>**Show resources not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams**</DNT> toggle, select the services you want to monitor, and then continue.

7. <DNT>Auto-discovery</DNT> automatically detects and visualizes the relationships between your AWS entities on maps and leverages few other flexibilities. For more details, refer to [Auto-discovery of AWS entities](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/set-up-auto-discovery-of-aws-entities/). If you want this feature, enable it on the <DNT>**Enable Auto Discovery (optional)**</DNT> page, and continue.
8. Click <DNT>**Launch your CloudFormation in AWS**</DNT>. The CloudFormation template opens in your AWS console with the configured parameters based on your selections in New Relic, so no additional editing is necessary unless you want to make changes.
9. Paste your license key into your AWS console.
10. To deploy the Cloudformation stack, in the AWS console, select <DNT>**Create stack**</DNT>. Creating the stack resources may take several minutes and may generate multiple stacks, depending on how you configure metrics forwarding. If stack creation fails, refer to the [troubleshooting procedure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/stack-creation-fails/).
11. After a successful stack creation, switch to the New Relic platform and continue with the guided integration till you see your AWS data in New Relic.
