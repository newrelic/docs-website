For seamless integration of your AWS account with New Relic, [Integration via CloudFormation and CloudWatch metric stream](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integration-for-metrics/via-cloudformation) is the most recommended approach. if you cannot use CloudFormation templates and do not prefer to use Terraform, refer the following procedure to integrate manually from the AWS console.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:
* **A New Relic [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys)**: You'll need a license key to connect your AWS services to your New Relic account.
* **[Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html)** to deploy new AWS resources and **[IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)**: You’ll need this permission for your AWS account.
* **[Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure)** for cloud integrations: You’ll need these permissions for your New Relic account.

## Integration steps [#integration-steps]

To integrate your AWS account with New Relic follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [<DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/cloud-aws).
2. Select the correct account.
3. Click <DNT>**Set up integration**</DNT>.
4. Follow the instructions on each screen, and fill in the fields that apply to you. For this integration, choose the following options in the given screens:

    1. <DNT>**Choose Data type(s)**</DNT>: <DNT>Metrics</DNT>
    2. <DNT>**Choose a setup method**</DNT>: <DNT>Manually integrate your AWS account</DNT>

5. On the <DNT>**Select services**</DNT> screen, if needed, use the <DNT>**Show resources not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams**</DNT> toggle, select the services you want to monitor, and then continue.

7. On the <DNT>**Choose data integration type**</DNT> screen, choose from the following integration options:
   * **Real-time AWS monitoring (Recommended)**: This option is for the services that support CloudWatch Metric Streams.
   * **API Polling**: This option is suitable for services not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams.

8. From the <DNT>**Create role**</DNT> page to <DNT>**Configure budgets policy**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions and perform the steps in AWS console.
