For seamless integration of your AWS account with New Relic, [Integration via CloudFormation and CloudWatch metric stream](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integration-for-metrics/via-cloudformation) is the most recommended approach. If you cannot use CloudFormation templates and do not prefer to use Terraform, refer to the following procedure to integrate manually from the AWS console.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:
* **A New Relic [Ingest - license key and a User key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys)**: You'll need these keys to connect your AWS services to your New Relic account.
* **[Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html)** to deploy new AWS resources and **[IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)**: You’ll need this permission for your AWS account.
* **[Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure)** for cloud integrations: You’ll need these permissions for your New Relic account.

## Integration steps [#integration-steps]

To integrate your AWS account with New Relic, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [<DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT>](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/cloud-aws).
2. Select the correct account.
3. Click <DNT>**Set up integration**</DNT>.
4. Follow the instructions on each screen, and fill in the fields that apply to you. For this integration, choose the following options in the given screens:

    1. <DNT>**Choose Data type(s)**</DNT>: <DNT>Metrics</DNT>
    2. <DNT>**Choose a setup method**</DNT>: <DNT>Manually integrate your AWS account</DNT>

5. On the <DNT>**Select services**</DNT> screen, if needed, use the <DNT>**Show resources not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams**</DNT> toggle, select the services you want to monitor, and then continue.

7. On the <DNT>**Choose data integration type**</DNT> screen, choose from the following integration options:
   * **Real-time AWS monitoring (Recommended)**: This option is for the services that support CloudWatch Metric Streams.
   * **API Polling**: This option is suitable for services not supported by CloudWatch Metric Streams.

8. From the <DNT>**Create role**</DNT> page to <DNT>**Configure budgets policy**</DNT> page, follow the on-screen instructions and perform the steps in AWS console.
9. After creating the policy in AWS console, switch to the New Relic platform and continue with the guided integration till you see your AWS data in New Relic.
