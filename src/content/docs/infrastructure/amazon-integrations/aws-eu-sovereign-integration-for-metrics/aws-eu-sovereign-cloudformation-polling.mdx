Use API Polling for services that are not supported via CloudWatch Metric Streams, such as Billing, CloudTrail, Health, Trusted Advisor, and X-Ray.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* A New Relic [Ingest - license key and a User key](https://one.eu.newrelic.com/api-keys): You'll need these keys to connect your AWS services to your New Relic account.
* [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions.html) to deploy new AWS resources and [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html): You'll need this permission for your AWS account.
* [Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure) for cloud integrations: You'll need these permissions for your New Relic account.

## Integration steps [#integration-steps]

To integrate your AWS EU Sovereign Cloud account with New Relic using CloudFormation and API Polling, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to <DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS EU Sovereign Cloud**</DNT>.
2. Select the correct account.
3. Click <DNT>**Set up integration**</DNT>.
4. Follow the instructions on each screen, and fill in the fields that apply to you. For this integration, choose the following options in the given screens:

    1. <DNT>**Choose a setup method**</DNT>: Automate AWS with CloudFormation (Recommended)
    2. <DNT>**Choose a metrics integration type**</DNT>: API Polling

5. On the <DNT>**Select services**</DNT> screen, select the services you want to monitor, and then continue.
6. Click <DNT>**Launch your CloudFormation in AWS**</DNT>. The CloudFormation template opens in your AWS console with the configured parameters based on your selections in New Relic.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Review the scope of access and monitoring carefully in the CFT and edit it further as necessary to ensure only the data that can leave your AWS EU Sovereign Cloud, does so to a non-sovereign cloud environment.
    </Callout>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      To get additional metadata from your AWS services, enable <DNT>**AWS Config**</DNT> from the AWS console.
    </Callout>

8. To deploy the CloudFormation stack, in the AWS console, select <DNT>**Create stack**</DNT>. Creating the stack resources may take several minutes and may generate multiple stacks, depending on how you configure metrics forwarding.
9. After a successful stack creation, switch to the New Relic platform and continue with the guided integration till you see your AWS data in New Relic.
