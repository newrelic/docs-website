For seamless integration of your AWS EU Sovereign Cloud account with New Relic, [Integration via CloudFormation and CloudWatch metric stream](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-eu-sovereign-integration-for-metrics/aws-eu-sovereign-cloudformation-cwms) is the most recommended approach. If you are already managing your AWS accounts and services using Terraform, you might prefer the following integration method because New Relic offers an AWS Cloud Integrations module that simplifies setting up the integration.

The Terraform changes are available in version <DNT>**3.79.0**</DNT> of the New Relic provider. Note that the AWS provider now requires version <DNT>**6.30**</DNT> or later.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you begin integrating your AWS account with New Relic, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* [Permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-permissions/#infrastructure) for cloud integrations: You'll need these permissions for your New Relic account.
* The New Relic account ID and region that you want to link to AWS.

## Integration steps [#integration-steps]

To integrate your AWS EU Sovereign Cloud account with New Relic, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to <DNT>**Infrastructure > AWS EU Sovereign Cloud**</DNT>.
2. Select the correct account.
3. Click <DNT>**Set up integration**</DNT>.
4. Follow the instructions on each screen, and fill in the fields that apply to you. For this integration, choose the following options in the given screens:

    1. <DNT>**Choose Data type(s)**</DNT>: Metrics
    2. <DNT>**Choose a setup method**</DNT>: Automate with Terraform

5. On the <DNT>**Select services**</DNT> screen, if needed, select the services you want to monitor, and then continue.
6. From the <DNT>**Terraform**</DNT> screen, open the documentation that guides how to connect your New Relic account with the Terraform provider account.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Review the scope of access and monitoring carefully in your Terraform configuration and edit it further as necessary to ensure only the data that can leave your AWS EU Sovereign Cloud, does so to a non-sovereign cloud environment.
    </Callout>

7. After a successful integration, you can see your AWS data in New Relic.
