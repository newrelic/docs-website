## Problem

After setting up New Relic Infrastructure Amazon integrations, your usage of the [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) API has increased and subsequently impacted your [CloudWatch usage bill](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

## Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="arn"
    title="Verify your Infrastructure account's ARN"
  >
    Ensure that you are not collecting inventory information for the wrong ARN account. Verify that the ARN associated with your Infrastructure account is correct.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="polling-frequency"
    title="Change the polling frequency"
  >
    The [polling frequency](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/polling-intervals-aws-integrations) determines how often New Relic gathers data from your cloud provider. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. If you need to manage your Amazon CloudWatch bill, you may want to [decrease the polling frequency.](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations#polling)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="filter"
    title="Filter your data"

    You can set filters for each integration in order to specify which information you want captured. If you need to manage your Amazon CloudWatch bill, you may want to [filter your data](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations#filter-data).
  </Collapser>

    To review the API usage for New Relic Infrastructure integrations with Amazon AWS:

    1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS > Account status dashboard**.
    2. Review the dashboard.

    The dashboard includes a chart with your account's Amazon AWS API call count for the last month as well as the CloudWatch API calls (per AWS resource) for the last day. This information is the API usage for New Relic only. It does not include other AWS API or CloudWatch usage that may occur.

For assistance determining which services may cause an increase in billing, contact your New Relic account representative or get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/).

## Cause

New Relic Infrastructure Amazon integrations leverage CloudWatch to gather metrics. AWS charges joint customers for requests that exceed the first [one million per month](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.html).

CloudWatch billing issues may be caused by either of the following:

* Enabling Amazon integrations on several plugins for the same service
* Adding the incorrect [Role ARN](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) to your AWS integrations
