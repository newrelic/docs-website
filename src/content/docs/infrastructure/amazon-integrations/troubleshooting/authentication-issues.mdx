## Problem

You've set up your AWS integration and [connected it to New Relic](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure), but cannot see any data in the [AWS dashboard](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations#insights).

## Solution

Make sure you've [granted us the right permissions](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies) to retrieve your metrics.

To verify so, go to the **Account status dashboard** of your integration to check that no errors are being reported:

<img
  title="aws-status.png"
  alt="Screenshot showing the account status dashboard."
  src={awsStatus}
/>

In the Account status dashboard, check the **Permission Errors** dashboard and see if you have method errors for any of your data sources:

<img
  alt="Screenshot showing permissions errors in the account status dashboard."
  src={awsPermissionErrors}
/>

If errors are reported, make sure your permissions policy document (if it isn't the standard AWS `Read-Only Access` policy) has the methods reported in the errors dashboard according to our [custom permissions](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies) documentation.

<Callout variant="important">
  Some methods are not integration specific and **[must be granted for all integrations](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies#all-permissions)**.
