## Problem

You installed the infrastructure agent and then connected your Amazon account to it. After waiting a few minutes, you still do not see data for your AWS integrations in the infrastructure monitoring UI or when querying for the data.

## Solution

If you don't see data after waiting for at least 10 minutes, try these troubleshooting suggestions:

1. Make sure that the infrastructure agent is [installed and running properly](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-infrastructure). You need to install the infrastructure agent **first**, and then connect to your AWS account.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you see attribute names, but no data, at **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Events** or **Infrastructure > Settings > Agents**, you might not have installed the Infrastructure agent.
   </Callout>
2. Correct any errors that you see in the account status dashboards. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select the **Account status dashboard** for each of your accounts.

   If you see **Role errors** or **Permission errors** reporting, refer to our [integrations and managed policies](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies), and check that you've granted New Relic the required permissions to read the relevant data from your account.

   If you see other errors reporting, go to the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles) and make sure the settings for your AWS ARN match the following:

   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>
           Setting
         </th>

         <th>
           Value
         </th>
       </tr>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>
           **Account ID**
         </td>

         <td>
           `754728514883`
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           **External ID**
         </td>

         <td>
           your New Relic [account ID](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id)
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           **Policy**
         </td>

         <td>
           `ReadOnlyAccess`
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
3. Make sure that you are [looking in the right place](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#metric) for your data. You can find all integration data in [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
