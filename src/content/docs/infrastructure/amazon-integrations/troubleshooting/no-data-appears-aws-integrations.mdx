## Problem

You installed the infrastructure agent and then connected your Amazon account to it. After waiting a few minutes, you still do not see data for your AWS integrations in the infrastructure monitoring UI or when querying for the data.

## Solution

If you don't see data after waiting for at least 10 minutes, try these troubleshooting suggestions:

1. Make sure that the infrastructure agent is [installed and running properly](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-infrastructure). You need to install the infrastructure agent <DNT>**first**</DNT>, and then connect to your AWS account.

   <Callout variant="tip">
     If you see attribute names, but no data, at <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Events**</DNT> or <DNT>**Infrastructure > Settings > Agents**</DNT>, you might not have installed the Infrastructure agent.
   </Callout>
2. Correct any errors that you see in the account status dashboards. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select the <DNT>**Account status dashboard**</DNT> for each of your accounts.

   If you see <DNT>**Role errors**</DNT> or <DNT>**Permission errors**</DNT> reporting, refer to our [integrations and managed policies](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies), and check that you've granted New Relic the required permissions to read the relevant data from your account.

   If you see other errors reporting, go to the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles) and make sure the settings for your AWS ARN match the following:

   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>
           Setting
         </th>

         <th>
           Value
         </th>
       </tr>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>
           <DNT>
             **Account ID**
           </DNT>
         </td>

         <td>
           `253490767857`
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           <DNT>
             **External ID**
           </DNT>
         </td>

         <td>
           your New Relic [account ID](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/account-id)
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           <DNT>
             **Policy**
           </DNT>
         </td>

         <td>
           `ReadOnlyAccess`
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
3. Make sure that you are [looking in the right place](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#metric) for your data. You can find all integration data in [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
