## Problem

You can't create an [infrastructure alert condition](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) because the metric you want to alert on does not appear in the **Define thresholds** section of the Infrastructure UI's alerts page.

## Solution

Instead of using New Relic's Infrastructure UI, use [Infrastructure REST API calls](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts) to create the alert condition.

1. Review the [query syntax to create (POST)](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts#post-conditions) an Infrastructure condition.
2. Review the [API requirements for metric conditions](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts#metric-api).
3. When you create the condition: For the `select_value` field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where `provider` is a standard prefix string:

   ```
   provider.<var>metric</var>.<var>aggregation_type</var>
   ```

   * `metric`: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration.
   * `aggregation_type` Use `Sum`, `Average`, `Minimum`, or `Maximum`. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric.
4. For the `policy_id` field, use the unique ID for the condition's associated alert policy. Find the policy ID in the policy URL:

   ```
   https://alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/<var>ACCOUNT_ID</var>/policies/<var>ALERT_POLICY_ID</var>
   ```

## Cause

This happens because the **Define thresholds** dropdown list in the Infrastructure UI only shows the metrics that New Relic has been able to collect in the last hour.
