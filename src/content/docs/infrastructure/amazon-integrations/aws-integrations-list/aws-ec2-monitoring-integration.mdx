[New Relic infrastructure monitoring integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integration for reporting your EC2 metadata to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features [#about]

[Amazon's EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a central part of Amazon's cloud-computing platform. All New Relic Infrastructure users, regardless of [subscription level](https://newrelic.com/infrastructure/pricing), can use the New Relic Infrastructure agent to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status. New Relic's EC2 integration uses the [`ec2Describe*` policy](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) to add data about your EC2 instances to your standard Infrastructure data. Infrastructure also imports [Amazon EC2 custom tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) and adds it to your data.

You can also create [custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#attributes) to be analyzed in New Relic.

## Activate EC2 integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

<Callout variant="important">
  You must install the infrastructure agent on each EC2 host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your EC2 account allows New Relic to access EC2 metadata, such as region, type, and tags.
</Callout>

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon EC2 integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: [1 minute or 5 minutes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ebs-metricscollected.html), depending on CloudWatch plan

### Note about legacy tag format [#legacy-tag-format]

Starting October 27, 2021, EC2 instances that start being monitored by New Relic have only the following metadata [tag](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data) formats: 

  * Tag format in UI: `tag.tagName`
  * Tag format as [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute): `provider.attributeName`. Examples: `provider.ec2InstanceId`, `provider.ec2State`, `provider.ec2AmiId`.

For your EC2 instances monitored by New Relic before that date, you have the option to keep our legacy tag formats (below). To keep these formats, go into the New Relic configuration UI for your EC2 host and select **Keep legacy metadata format**. This allows you to access tags that have both current and legacy formats. Disabling the legacy format means you can only use the current format. If you disable the legacy format, consider checking to see if you have dashboards or alert conditions using that format. 

The legacy metadata tag format:

  * Legacy tag format in UI: 
    * `provider.ec2Tag_tagName`
    * `ec2Tag_tagName`
  * Legacy tag format as [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute): 
    * `attributeName`. Examples: `ec2InstanceId`, `ec2State`, `ec2AmiId`.

  
## Use data in New Relic UI [#view-ec2]

This table describes the locations in New Relic One where you can find and use your EC2 data:

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Infrastructure also imports your [Amazon EC2 custom tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html), typically prefaced by `label.<tag_key>`.

For more on how to find and use integration data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## View and use data [#insights-ec2]

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ComputeSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `Ec2Instance`.

The EC2 integration collects the following subset of instance metrics from AWS CloudWatch.

      <th style={{ width: "230px" }}>

        `statusCheckFailedInstance`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed the instance status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCheckFailedSystem`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed the system status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCheckFailed`
      </td>

      <td>
        Reports whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check in a one minute period. The check result can be either `0` (passed) or `1` (failed).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
