New Relic offers an [integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) for reporting your AWS IoT [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics-new-relic) and [inventory data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/).

[AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) is a service that provides communication between Internet-connected devices and the AWS Cloud. It also collects and stores telemetry data. With the AWS IoT Infrastructure integration, you can access these features:

* View charts and other information about your AWS IoT communication and telemetry data.
* Create custom queries and charts in New Relic from automatically captured metric data.
* Set alert conditions on your AWS IoT integration data directly from the New Relic **Integrations** page.

## Activate integration [#connect]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

By default, New Relic queries your AWS IoT services [every 5 minutes](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/polling-intervals-aws-integrations). If you want New Relic to query your services less often, you can [change the polling frequency](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

## Explore integration data [#find-data]

After [connecting the AWS IoT integration to New Relic](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-services-infrastructure) and waiting a few minutes, you can [use integration data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/):

## Metric data [#metrics]

To view metric data for your AWS IoT integration, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `IOTBrokerSample`, `IOTRuleActionSample`, and `IOTRuleSample` [events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type) and their related attributes. For more information on AWS IoT metrics and dimensions, see the [AWS IoT Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/metrics_dimensions.html).
