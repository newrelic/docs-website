[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS GameLift, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [GameLift](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.GameLift`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon GameLift data:

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
