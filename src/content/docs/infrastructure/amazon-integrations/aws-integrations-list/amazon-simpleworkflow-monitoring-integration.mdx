New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for reporting your [Amazon Simple Workflow (SWF)](https://aws.amazon.com/swf/) metrics and other data to New Relic. 

This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your Amazon Simple Workflow (SWF) services using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

This integration is available through CloudWatch Metric Streams. 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.simpleworkflow`.

## Metric data [#metrics]
