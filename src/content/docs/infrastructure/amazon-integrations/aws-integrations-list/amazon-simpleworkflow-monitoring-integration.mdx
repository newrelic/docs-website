[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for AWS SimpleWorkFlow, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Use our integration to collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Simple Workflow Service](https://aws.amazon.com/swf/). You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Get started

To enable this integration, see [how to connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

Once the integration is set up, you can find your metric data by going to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.SimpleWorkFlow`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon SWF data:

### Create alerts

You can set up alerts to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
