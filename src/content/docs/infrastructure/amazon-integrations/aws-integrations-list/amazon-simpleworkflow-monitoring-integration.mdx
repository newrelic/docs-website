[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for AWS SimpleWorkFlow, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Use our integration to collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Simple Workflow Service](https://aws.amazon.com/swf/). You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Get started

To enable this integration, see [how to connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

Once the integration is set up, you can find your metric data by going to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.SimpleWorkFlow`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon SWF data:

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about [creating alerts here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/).
