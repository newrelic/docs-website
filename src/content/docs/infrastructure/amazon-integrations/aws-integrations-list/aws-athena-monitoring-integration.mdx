New Relic offers an integration for reporting your [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon Athena integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using this [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):
