New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to monitor [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/) metrics and other data to New Relic. 

This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.
## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your CloudSearch services using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

This integration is available through CloudWatch MetricStreams. 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.cloudsearch`.

Additionally, you can find the entities associated with AWS Backup by going to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-entities) and searching for `cloudsearch`.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
