[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS Textract, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Textract app](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and data transfer

We recommend you to [stream data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export) rather than using [polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations), though currently both options are supported.

If you choose to use polling, you can adjust the polling frequency using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

This is the [default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for the AWS integrations:

- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.textract`.

## How to use your data

### Create alerts

You can set up alerts to notify you of breaking changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
