[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting Amazon Elasticsearch data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

[Amazon Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. New Relic's Elasticsearch monitoring integration allows you to track cluster status, CPU utilization, read/write latency, throughput, and other metrics, at specific points in time. Elasticsearch data is also available [to query, analyze, and chart your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon Elasticsearch integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/understand-use-data-infrastructure-integrations/) this integration's data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Elasticsearch integration links.

To [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), use the `DatastoreSample` event type with the appropriate `provider` value:

* `ElasticsearchCluster` for clusters
* `ElasticsearchNode` for nodes

## Metric data [#metrics]

The Elasticsearch integration collects these metrics for clusters:

      <td>
        Indicates that the primary shards for all indices are allocated to nodes in a cluster, but the replica shards for at least one index are not. Single node clusters always initialize with this cluster status because there is no second node to which a replica can be assigned.

        You can either increase your node count to obtain a green cluster status, or you can use the Amazon ES API to set the `number_of_replicas` setting for your index to 0. For more information, see Amazon's documentation for [Updating indices settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/indices-update-settings.html).

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).

The integration collects this ElasticSearch data as [inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).
