<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon Web Services RDS data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

New Relic also offers an [integration for enhanced RDS monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-rds-enhanced-monitoring-integration).

## Features [#features]

Amazon's [Relational Database Service (RDS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

New Relic's RDS monitoring integration gathers metric and configuration data for the relational databases associated with your Amazon RDS account. Your RDS data is available in pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and you can also create [custom queries and charts](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can create [alert conditions](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) for RDS data, and use the reported data to plan for future RDS capacity.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon RDS integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute for RDS instances; 5 minutes for RDS clusters

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the RDS integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `DatastoreSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `RdsDbInstance` for DB instances, or `RdsDbCluster` for Aurora DB clusters.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects Amazon RDS data for clusters and also for instances. Some RDS instance metrics are distinct for cluster instances and stand-alone instances.
