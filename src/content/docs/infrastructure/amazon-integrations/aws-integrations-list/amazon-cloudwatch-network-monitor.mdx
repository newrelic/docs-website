[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor, sending its metric data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data you can report.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [CloudWatch Network Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/nw-monitor-create-console.html) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.networkmonitor`.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
