New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to monitor [AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/nw-monitor-create-console.html) metrics and other data to New Relic. 

This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your CloudWatch Network Monitor services using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

This integration is available through CloudWatch MetricStreams. 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.networkmonitor`.
