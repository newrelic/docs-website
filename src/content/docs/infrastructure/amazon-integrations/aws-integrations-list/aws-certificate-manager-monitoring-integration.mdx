New Relic infrastructure now include an integration for AWS Certificate Manager that enables sending its metric data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data is available for reporting.

## Features

Using our integration, we collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/). You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration, follow the instructions in our [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration documentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)
2. Select <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>
3. Filter by `aws.certificatemanager`

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon Certificate Manager data:

### Certificate Manager Metric data

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Metric (min, max, average, count, sum)  

      </th>

      <th>
        Unit  

      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `DaysToExpiry`
      </td>

      <td>
        count
      </td>

      <td>
        Number of days until a certificate expires. ACM stops publishing this metric after a certificate expires.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

All imported data has the dimension: `CertificateArn`.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you of any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts in our [Introduction to alerts documentation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
