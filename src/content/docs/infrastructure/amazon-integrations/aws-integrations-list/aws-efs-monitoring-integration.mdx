[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an Amazon EFS integration for reporting your EFS data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

With New Relic's integration for monitoring [AWS Elastic File System (EFS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html), you can monitor EFS file system size, read/write operations, I/O capacity, throughput, and more. AWS integration data is also available for analysis, queries, and chart creation [in New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure#insights).

If connected through a [VPC](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-vpc-monitoring-integration), you can also use the EFS file system with your own on-premise servers, which allows you to share file systems across different applications hosted on hybrid solutions.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon EFS integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find this integration's data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Amazon EFS integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `BlockDeviceSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `EfsFileSystem`.

For more on how to find and use integration data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon EFS metrics:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `BurstCreditBalance`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of burst credits that a file system has.

        Burst credits allow a file system to burst to throughput levels above a file system’s baseline level for periods of time. For more information, see [Throughput scaling in Amazon EFS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#bursting).

        The `Minimum` statistic is the smallest burst credit balance for any minute during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the largest burst credit balance for any minute during the period. The `Average` statistic is the average burst credit balance during the period.

        Units: Bytes

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ClientConnections`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of client connections to a file system. When using a standard client, there is one connection per mounted Amazon EC2 instance.

        Note: To calculate the average `ClientConnections` for periods greater than one minute, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of minutes in the period.

        Units: Count of client connections

        Valid statistics: `Sum`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `DataReadIOBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of bytes for each file system read operation.

        The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with read operations. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest read operation during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest read operation during the period. The `Average` statistic is the average size of read operations during the period. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of read operations.

        Units:

        * Bytes for `Minimum, Maximum, Average,` and `Sum`.
        * Count for `SampleCount`.

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum, SampleCount`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `DataWriteIOBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of bytes for each file system write operation.

        The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with write operations. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest write operation during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest write operation during the period. The `Average` statistic is the average size of write operations during the period. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of write operations.

        Units:

        * Bytes are the units for the `Minimum, Maximum, Average`, and `Sum` statistics.
        * Count for `SampleCount`.

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum, SampleCount`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `MetadataIOBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of bytes for each metadata operation.

        The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with metadata operations. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest metadata operation during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest metadata operation during the period. The `Average` statistic is the size of the average metadata operation during the period. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of metadata operations.

        Units:

        * Bytes are the units for the `Minimum, Maximum, Average,` and `Sum` statistics.
        * Count for `SampleCount`.

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum, SampleCount`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        `PercentIOLimit`
      </td>

      <td>
        Shows how close a file system is to reaching the I/O limit of the General Purpose performance mode. If this metric is at 100% more often than not, consider moving your application to a file system using the Max I/O performance mode.

        Note: This metric is only submitted for file systems using the General Purpose performance mode.

        Units: Percent
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `PermittedThroughput`
      </td>

      <td>
        The maximum amount of throughput a file system is allowed, given the file system size and `BurstCreditBalance`. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Performance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html).

        The `Minimum` statistic is the smallest throughput permitted for any minute during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the highest throughput permitted for any minute during the period. The `Average` statistic is the average throughput permitted during the period.

        Units: Bytes per second

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `TotalIOBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of bytes for each file system operation, including data read, data write, and metadata operations.

        The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with all file system operations. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest operation during the period. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest operation during the period. The `Average` statistic is the average size of an operation during the period. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of all operations.

        Note: To calculate the average operations per second for a period, divide the `SampleCount` statistic by the number of seconds in the period. To calculate the average throughput (Bytes per second) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period.

        Units:

        * Bytes for `Minimum, Maximum, Average,` and `Sum` statistics.
        * Count for `SampleCount`.

        Valid statistics: `Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum, SampleCount`
