The New Relic AWS Lambda Telemetry extension allows users to send telemetry data straight from their lambda functions into New Relic, with no need to set up triggers or connect Amazon CloudWatch. Send your logs, events, metrics and traces by simply adding the extension as the layer, and setting up your New Relic license key as a parameter in Environment Variables.

## Installation


1. In the AWS Console go to **Lambda** > **Functions** and choose the function you'd like to ingest data from.
2. Select **Layers** > **Add Layer**.
3. In **Choose a layer** select the **Specify a layer by providing the ARN** option.
4. Arn with the most recent version of the layer can be found on https://layers.newrelic-external.com/, just look for AwsLambdaExtension in your region of interest, copy and paste it in the field, then click **Add**.
5. Go to **Configuration**, select **Environment variables** and add **Key: LICENSE_KEY  Value: <var>LICENSE_KEY</var>**. 

To verify that set up has been done correctly, click the **Test** button in **code** section. 

## Find your data

Thereafter, you can find your data on New Relic by navigating to **[https://one.newrelic.com/](https://one.newrelic.com/)** > **Browse data** > then selecting one of 4 categories: **Logs, Events, Metrics or Traces**.
