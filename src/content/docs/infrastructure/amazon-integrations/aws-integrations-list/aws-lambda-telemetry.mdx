The New Relic AWS Lambda Telemetry extension allows users to send telemetry data straight from their lambda functions into New Relic, with no need to set up triggers or connect Amazon CloudWatch. Send your logs, events, metrics and traces by adding the extension as the layer, and setting up your New Relic license key as an environment variable.

## Installation


1. In the AWS Console go to **Lambda** > **Functions** and choose the function you'd like to ingest data from.
2. Select **Layers** > **Add Layer**.
3. In **Choose a layer** select the **Specify a layer by providing the ARN** option.
4. Navigate to [https://layers.newrelic-external.com/](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/), search for AwsLambdaExtension in your region to find the arn with the most recent layer version, and then paste that in the Arn field back in your AWS console. 
6. Go to **Configuration**, select **Environment variables** and add **Key: LICENSE_KEY  Value: LICENSE_KEY**. 

To verify that set up has been done correctly, click the **Test** button in **code** section. 

## Find your data

You can find your data on New Relic by navigating to **[https://one.newrelic.com/](https://one.newrelic.com/)** > **Browse data** > then selecting one of 4 categories: **Logs, Events, Metrics or Traces**.

### Logs:

Logs can be filtered by specific attributes set. Click **Attributes** in left menu and then choose the attributes of interest. For example:

```
SOURCE > api.logs
PLUGIN > TYPE > lambda extension
AWS > EXTENSION > AwsLambdaExtension
```

### Metrics:

Metrics sent by the extension are prefixed with `aws.telemetry.lambda_ext.`. Currently there are 6 AWS lambda metrics:

```
'durationMs'
'billedDurationMs'
'initDurationMs'
'memorySizeMB'
'maxMemoryUsedMB'
'producedBytes'
```

### Events

To see event sent by this extension, in **Custom events** section look for `AwsLambdaExtension`. Currently there are twelve event types:

```
platform_initStart
platform_initRuntimeDone
platform_initReport
platform_start
platform_runtimeDone
platform_fault
platform_report
platform_extension
platform_telemetrySubscription
platform_logsDropped

```

You can filter the data further under the `Dimensions` menu.
