[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for collecting [enhanced Amazon RDS data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html); this supplements the basic [New Relic RDS integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-rds-monitoring-integration) with real-time metrics about the operating system the database instance runs on.

## Features

This New Relic integration allows you to monitor and [alert](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) on RDS Enhanced Monitoring. You can use integration data and alerts to monitor the DB processes and identify potential trouble spots as well as to profile the DB allowing you to improve and optimize their response and cost.

## Enable enhanced monitoring [#activate]

<Callout variant="important">
  Enabling this integration will incur some additional charges to your Amazon CloudWatch account. In addition there are some limitations and CPU metric data collection differences that are explained in Amazon's [enhanced monitoring](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html) documentation.
</Callout>

You must first have the New Relic [Amazon RDS monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-rds-monitoring-integration) enabled before enabling RDS Enhanced Monitoring. Be sure that you have completed the steps in [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

New Relic uses AWS Lambda in order to collect RDS logs and provide near-real time data of your RDS instances, this capability is called RDS Enhanced Monitoring in AWS.

Follow these steps in order to enable RDS Enhanced Monitoring integration:

1. Specify the RDS instances that need Enable RDS Enhanced Monitoring. You can specify this when creating or modifying the instance: under **Monitoring**, set **Enable Enhanced Monitoring** to **Yes**. We recommend setting the data **Granularity** to 15 seconds.
2. After enhanced monitoring is enabled, a stream called `RDSOSMetrics` is created in AWS CloudWatch Logs. Enhanced monitoring metrics are available via this stream. Create a lambda function and subscribe it to that stream in the following steps to obtain the data.
3. Create a new AWS Lambda function from the Serverless Repository: Go to **Lambda > Create Function > Browse serverless App repository**, check the box for **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies**, and search for `NewRelic-log-ingestion`.
4. Populate the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable with your New Relic account [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).
5. Select **Deploy** to create a new CloudFormation stack, a new function called `newrelic-log-ingestion`, and the required role.

   Make sure that the `NewRelic-log-ingestion` function execution role has attached the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess` policy, giving it the appropriate permissions to read CloudWatch Logs.
6. Go to the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
7. Continue with the procedure to [stream logs to the Lambda function](#stream-logs).

## Stream logs to Lambda function [#stream-logs]

To link the `RDSOSMetrics` log stream to the Lambda function (JSON format):

1. From **AWS Console > CloudWatch > Logs**, select `RDSOSMetrics` log group, and apply **Actions >** **Create Lambda subscription filter**.
2. For the **Lambda function**, select `newrelic-log-ingestion`.
3. From the **Log Format** dropdown, select `JSON` as the **Log format**.
4. At the bottom, click the **Start streaming** button to save your Lambda subscription filter.

Once completed, the Lambda function will send all the log lines from `RDSOSMetrics` to New Relic's ingest services.

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring integration:

* New Relic polling interval:
  * 30 seconds on average (collected via CloudWatch Logs)
  * Configurable when setting up AWS Lambda
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select the **RDS > Enhanced monitoring dashboard** link.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `DatastoreSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `RdsDbInstance` .

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

New Relic collects the following enhanced RDS data:

        * `RDS Child Process`: Nested under RDS Processes, shows a summary of the RDS processes that support the DB instance, for example `aurora` for Amazon Aurora DB clusters and `mysqld` for MySQL DB instances.
