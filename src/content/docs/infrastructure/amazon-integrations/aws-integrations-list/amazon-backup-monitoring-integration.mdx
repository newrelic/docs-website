New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to monitor [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) metrics and other data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your AWS Backup services using our integration. Check your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate-integration]

This integration is available through CloudWatch MetricStreams. 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics & Events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.backup`.

Additionally, you can find the entities associated with AWS Backup by going to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-entities) and searching for `backup`.

## Metric data [#metric-data]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following AWS Backup metrics:

        `NumberOfBackupJobsFailed`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of backup jobs with a status of Failed. Often caused by scheduling a backup job during or 1 hour before a database resource or 4 hours before or during an Amazon FSx maintenance window or automated backup window and not using AWS Backup to perform continuous backup for point-in-time restores. See Point-in-Time Recovery for a list of supported services and instructions on how to use AWS Backup to take continuous backups, or reschedule your backup jobs.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to receive a notification if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to get a notification about relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/).
