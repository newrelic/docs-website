[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS Backup, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data you can report.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) using our integration. Check your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate-integration]

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics & Events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.backup`.

## Metric data [#metric-data]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following AWS Backup metrics:

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NumberOfBackupJobsFailed`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of backup jobs with a status of Failed. Often caused by scheduling a backup job during or 1 hour before a database resource or 4 hours before or during an Amazon FSx maintenance window or automated backup window and not using AWS Backup to perform continuous backup for point-in-time restores. See Point-in-Time Recovery for a list of supported services and instructions on how to use AWS Backup to take continuous backups, or reschedule your backup jobs.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to receive a notification if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to get a notification about relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/).
