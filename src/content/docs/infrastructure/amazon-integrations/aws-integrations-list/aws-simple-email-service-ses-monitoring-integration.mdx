<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) is a cloud-based service for sending and receiving email. With New Relic's integration with Amazon SES, you can gather metrics and configuration options related to emails sent and received.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon SES integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 1 minute resolution

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After you [connect your AWS integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure), New Relic will start monitoring your AWS data. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alert settings: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select the integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using these events:

* `SesConfigurationSetSample`
* `SesReceiptSample`
* `SesRegionSample`

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic integration collects the following Amazon SES data. For full descriptions of some of these metrics, see [Amazon's SNS metrics and dimensions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sns-metricscollected.html).
