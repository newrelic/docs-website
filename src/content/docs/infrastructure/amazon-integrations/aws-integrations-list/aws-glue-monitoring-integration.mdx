New Relic offers an integration for reporting your [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Glue integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the following [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity
      </th>

      <th>
        Event Type
      </th>

      <th>
        Provider
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Job
      </td>

      <td>
        `AwsGlueJobSample`
      </td>

      <td>
        `AwsGlueJob`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects AWS Glue data for Job.
