[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS IoT Twinmaker that sends its metrics data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data it can reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker/) using our integration. This lets you monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate and use the integration

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/). To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.IoTTwinMaker`.
