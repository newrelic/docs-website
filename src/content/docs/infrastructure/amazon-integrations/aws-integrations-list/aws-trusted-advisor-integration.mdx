<Callout variant="tip">
  In order to use this integration, you must have an AWS Business or Enterprise [support plan](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/).
</Callout>

The AWS [Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/) is an online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you follow AWS best practices for provisioning your resources.

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your service limits data to New Relic products. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

<Callout variant="important">
  This integration requires additional access permissions not covered by default managed policies. You can find out more on [Integrations and managed policies](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies#recommended) page.
</Callout>

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Trusted Advisor integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 1 hour

In order to have fresh data, New Relic programmatically sends refresh requests to AWS. Trusted Advisor checks are [automatically refreshed by AWS weekly](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#TArefresh) only for customers with AWS Business or Enterprise Support plans.

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select the AWS Trusted Advisor integration link.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `TrustedAdvisorSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) within one category of data:

* Service limits: Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `ServiceLimits`.

## Metric data

There is one `Trusted Advisor` category of data: `ServiceLimits`.

### Service limits metrics [#metric-service-limits]

Our Amazon integrations collect the following Amazon Service limits data to the provider `ServiceLimits`.
