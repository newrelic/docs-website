---

New Relic provides an integration for your [AWS Verified Access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verified-access/latest/ug/what-is-verified-access.html).

## Features [#about]

[AWS Verified Access](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-access) is a tool that provides secure access to corporate applications without requiring a VPN.

Any time someone attempts to access your corporate application, a log is created, and they can be forwarded to New Relic via [AWS Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose).

This integration monitors your Verified Access activity, including top denied IP addresses, overall count of denied and granted activity, and more.

## Activate Verified Access integration [#activate-integration]

<Callout variant="important">
To use Kinesis Firehose, you must have a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream already created. If you do not, you can create one by going to Amazon Kinesis Firehose feature from your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/firehose), and creating a delivery stream with `Destination: New Relic`.

[Learn more about creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html?icmpid=docs_console_unmapped)
</Callout>

To set up this integration:  

1.	From your AWS console, navigate to the [AWS VPC Service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).
2.	From the left panel, under the **AWS Verified Access** dropdown, select `Verified Access instances`.
3.	Select the ID of the instance you would like to configure.
4.	Select the `Verified Access instance logging configuration` tab.
5.	Select `Modify Verified Access instance logging configuration`.
6.	Select the `Deliver to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose` toggle.
7.	Select a delivery stream configured to point to New Relic.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

You can query and explore your data in [our logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui), using a filter of `metadata.product.name = Verified Access`.

This table describes the data reported from Verified Access logs. For example logs, see the [AWS Verified Access log examples doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verified-access/latest/ug/verified-access-logs-examples.html).
