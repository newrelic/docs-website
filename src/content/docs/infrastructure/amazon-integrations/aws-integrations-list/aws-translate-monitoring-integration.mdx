[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS Translate, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Translate app](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Report data [#report-data]

We have two options for reporting this data. The recommended path is setting up our [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream). Alternatively, you can use our [older Amazon integration that relies on polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations). 

- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.translate`.

## Tips on using your data [#use-data]

You can create alerts to notify you of any developing changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).
