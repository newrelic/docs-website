metaDescription: "The New Relic Amazon NAT Gateway integration: Use AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams to monitor your NAT Gateway performance."
---

Our NAT Gateway integration reports data from your NAT Gateway service to your New Relic account using AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. 

## Features [#features]

With this integration, you can see your [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) telemetry data in New Relic. You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards, to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams [#activate]

To enable AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams, follow [the instructions for connecting AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you already have AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams enabled, you should already see the metrics in New Relic! No need to make any changes.
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Data from this integration is attached to [our `Metric` data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics). 

One way to find your data: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.natgateway`.

## Tips for using your data [#tips]

For how to create custom charts of your data, see [our NRQL docs](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language). For tips on querying this kind of data, see [Query metric data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-metric-data-type). 

You can set up alerts to get notifications about changes in your data. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).
