[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS Health data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features [#features]

This integration collects information from [AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html) about events that can affect the AWS resources and services globally or in a specific account. This data can help you anticipate potential application outages.

AWS Health reports three types of events:

* **Open issues**: Shows issues that might affect your AWS infrastructure.
* **Scheduled changes**: Informs you in advance of scheduled activities that might have an impact on AWS services and resources.
* **Notifications**: Provides additional information.

## Requirements [#requirements]

This integration is available only for AWS customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan, because this is a requirement for using the [AWS Health API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Health integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

## Explore integration data [#find-use]

To use this integration's data:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select any of the available AWS Health integration links.
3. To view a timeline when an AWS Health event is created, modified, or deleted, use the [**Events** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

## Events monitoring and alerts [#event-monitoring]

AWS Health events are ingested in New Relic One as **AwsHealthNotification** events. You can query, create widgets, and define NRQL alert policies based on these events.

The following table shows the main attributes available for **AwsHealthNotification** events:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Event Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `affectedEntityArn`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        The AWS resource ARN.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `arn`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        The ARN of the AWS Health event itself.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `affectedRegion`
      </td>

        The AWS affected region.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `affectedResources`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        Number of affected resources. Auto-generated metric that can be used to define New Relic alert conditions. 
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `description`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        Detailed description of the event.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `eventTypeCategory`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        AWS Health category: Issue, ScheduledChange, AccountNotification, Investigation.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `eventTypeCode`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        A list of unique identifiers for event types. For example,`AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT` or `AWS_RDS_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `service`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        The AWS services associated with the event. For example, EC2, RDS.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `statusCode`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        The AWS health event status: `Open`, `Closed`, `Upcoming`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        `startTime`
      </td>
      
      <td>
        Date and time the event began.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

NRQL alert conditions can be defined to receive notifications when health events are reported by AWS.

For example, the following query monitors any open issues on EC2 by resource:
```
SELECT uniqueCount(affectedEntityArn) FROM AwsHealthNotification where statusCode = 'open' and eventTypeCategory = 'Issue' and service = 'EC2'
```

## Inventory data [#metrics]

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

Inventory data provides information about active AWS Health events. New Relic's AWS Health integration generates three types of entities, each of which have the same inventory data:

* `aws/health/issue/`
* `aws/health/scheduled-change/`
* `aws/health/notification/`
