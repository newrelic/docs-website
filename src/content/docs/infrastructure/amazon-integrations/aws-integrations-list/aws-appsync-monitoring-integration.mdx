<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

New Relic offers an integration for reporting your [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS AppSync integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data in the infrastructure UI, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using this [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data):

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects AWS AppSync data for Api.

        `4XXError`
      </td>

      <td>
        Count
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of errors captured as a result of invalid requests due to incorrect client configuration. Typically, these errors happen anywhere outside of the GraphQL execution. For example, this could be an incorrect JSON payload or an incorrect query in the request, when the service is throttled, or even a potential misconfiguration on the Auth settings.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `5XXError`
      </td>

      <td>
        Count
      </td>

      <td>
        Errors encountered during the execution of a GraphQL query. For example, this could occur when a query request is initiated for an empty or incorrect schema, if the Amazon Cognito user pool ID or AWS Region is invalid. Alternatively, this could also happen if AWS AppSync encounters an issue during an execution of a request.

        `Latency`
      </td>

      <td>
        Milliseconds
      </td>

      <td>
        The time between when AWS AppSync receives a request from a client and when it returns a response to the client. This doesn't include the network latency encountered for a response to reach the end devices.
