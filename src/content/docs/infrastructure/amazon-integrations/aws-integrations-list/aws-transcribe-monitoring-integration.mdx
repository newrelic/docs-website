[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe) that reports your Transcribe metrics to New Relic. 

## Features [#features]

With this integration, collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) service. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/#set-up-metric-stream).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Data from this integration is attached to the `Metric` data type. To find this data in the UI: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter for `aws.transcribe`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon Transcribe data:

## Tips on using your data [#use-data]

You can create alerts to notify you of any developing changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).
