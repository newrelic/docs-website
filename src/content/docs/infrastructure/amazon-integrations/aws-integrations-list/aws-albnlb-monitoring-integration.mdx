<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[Amazon Application Load Balancing](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) (ALB) distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple availability zones. [Amazon Network Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) (NLB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS ALB/NLB data to New Relic products. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured.

New Relic also offers an [integration for Amazon's Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-elb-monitoring-integration).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS ALB/NLB integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the AWS ALB integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `LoadBalancerSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) within four categories of data:

* ALB: Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `Alb`.
* NLB: Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `Nlb`.
* [ALB target group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html): Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `AlbTargetGroup`.
* [NLB target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html): Appears in New Relic with `provider` value`NlbTargetGroup`.

## Metric data

There are two ALB integration categories of data: ALB and ALB target group.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="EOL NOTICE"
>
  After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

[Inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) provides information about the service's state and configuration. ALB/NLB configuration options are reported as inventory data.
