<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[Amazon Application Load Balancing](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) (ALB) distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple availability zones. [Amazon Network Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) (NLB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS ALB/NLB data to New Relic products. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured.

New Relic also offers an [integration for Amazon's Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-elb-monitoring-integration).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS ALB/NLB integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the AWS ALB integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `LoadBalancerSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) within four categories of data:

* ALB: Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `Alb`.
* NLB: Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `Nlb`.
* [ALB target group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html): Appears in New Relic with `provider` value `AlbTargetGroup`.
* [NLB target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html): Appears in New Relic with `provider` value`NlbTargetGroup`.

## Metric data

There are two ALB integration categories of data: ALB and ALB target group.

### ALB metrics [#metric-alb]

New Relic Amazon integrations collect the following Amazon ALB data to the provider `Alb`.

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `activeConnectionCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of concurrent TCP connections active from clients to the load balancer and from the load balancer to targets.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `rejectedConnectionCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of connections that were rejected because the load balancer had reached its maximum number of connections.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

    Stats: Sum provides the most value.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `rulesEvaluated`

      </td>

      <td>

There are two NLB integration categories of data: NLB and NLB target group.

### NLB metrics [#metric-alb]

New Relic Amazon integrations collect the following Amazon NLB data to the provider `Nlb`.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
