New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for reporting your [Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) metrics and other data to New Relic. 

This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

Amazon SQS provides hosted queues for storing messages in transit. New Relic's SQS integration reports queue-related data such as the count of messages delivered, delayed, and received, message size, and other [metrics](#metrics). SQS data is available in pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> and you can also create [custom queries and charts](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can also create alert conditions to notify you of changes in SQS data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

This integration is available through CloudWatch Metric Streams. 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

### Activate using the legacy API Polling integration [#polling]

To enable this integration using our legacy polling integration, see how to enable the [AWS API Polling integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/).

<Callout variant="tip">
You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon SQS integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* AWS CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select one of the SQS integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `QueueSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `SqsQueue`.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon SQS metrics. For full metric descriptions, see [Amazon's SQS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sqs-metricscollected.html).

    <tr>
      <td>
        `approximateAgeOfOldestMessage`
      </td>

      <td>
        The approximate age of the oldest non-deleted message in the queue, in seconds. For dead letter queues, this value is the longest time that a message has been in the queue.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `approximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed`
      </td>

      <td>
        The approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `approximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`
      </td>

      <td>
        The approximate number of messages that are "in flight." Messages are considered in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`

    <tr>
      <td>
        `numberOfEmptyReceives`
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `numberOfMessagesReceived`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of messages returned by calls to the `ReceiveMessage` API action.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `numberOfMessagesSent`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of messages added to a queue.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about [creating alerts here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/).
