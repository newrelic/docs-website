<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon Neptune data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon Neptune integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the following [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data):
