freshnessValidatedDate: 2023-10-18
---

You can now integrate the infrastructure agent with AWS [Database Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/), letting you send its metric data to New Relic. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

To enable this integration, follow our instructions to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/). Once enabled, you can find your integration's metrics at <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.dms`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon Database Migration Service data:

All imported data has one common dimension: `ReplicationInstanceIdentifier`

## Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
