[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS Chatbot, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Chatbot](https://aws.amazon.com/chatbot/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/#set-up-metric-stream).

<Callout variant="important">
  To get AWS Chatbot metrics, change your Amazon CloudWatch region to `US East (N. Virginia)`. Read more about it in [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html).
</Callout>

## Find and use data

To find your integration's metrics, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.chatbot`.

### Create alerts

You can set up alerts to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
