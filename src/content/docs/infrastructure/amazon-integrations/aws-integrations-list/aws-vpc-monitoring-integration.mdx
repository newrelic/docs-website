[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon VPC data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

The Amazon [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) is a virtual network that utilizes the scalable infrastructure of Amazon Web Services (AWS). With New Relic's VPC integration, you can gain visibility into configuration event changes that are overlaid across your Amazon services.

The Amazon VPC integration generates a feed of [configuration/inventory changes](#inventory) that occur in your VPC. VPC data is available in pre-built dashboards, and you can create custom queries and charts in [New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can also create alert conditions to notify you about changes in the VPC.

Additionally, [Enhanced Amazon VPC Flow Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html "Link opens in a new window.") enables you to capture information about IP traffic to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

## Activate

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon VPC integration:

* Default New Relic polling interval: 15 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the VPC integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `PrivateNetworkSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with `provider` values of:

* [VpcNatGateway](#vpc-nat-gateway)
* [VpcVpnTunnel](#vpc-vpn-tunnel)

<Callout variant="important">
By default, collection of VpcNatGateway, VpcVpnTunnel, and VpcVpnConnection data is disabled.
</Callout>

This is because if you have many NAT gateways or many VPNs (connections and tunnels), it might lead to an increase on your CloudWatch bill. For this reason, the integration provides configuration settings to set whether you want to fetch that data.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

### VPC NAT Gateway data [#vpc-nat-gateway]
