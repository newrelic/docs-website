New Relic integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for reporting your [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) metrics and other data to New Relic. 

This document explains how to activate the integration, and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your Amazon Cognito services using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

This integration is available through CloudWatch MetricStreams (Recommended). 

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic via CloudWatch Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

### Activate using the legacy API Polling integration [#polling]

To enable this integration using our legacy polling integration, see how to enable the [AWS API Polling integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/).

<Callout variant="tip">
You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Cognito integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* AWS CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.cognito`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects AWS Cognito data for UserPool.

### Create alerts

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
