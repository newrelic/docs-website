[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for AWS Elastic Transcoder, which sends its metrics to New Relic.

## Features [#features]

Use our integration to collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Elastic Transcoder service](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/). You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Get started [#get-started]

To enable this integration, see [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup).

Once the integration is set up, you can find your data by going to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filtering by `aws.elastictranscoder`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon Elastic Transcoder data:

## Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify your team members of critical or fatal errors. For more information, see [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition).
