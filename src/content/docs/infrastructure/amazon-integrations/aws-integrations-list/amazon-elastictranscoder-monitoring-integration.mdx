[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for AWS Elastic Transcoder, which sends its metrics to New Relic.

## Features [#features]

Use our integration to collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Elastic Transcoder service](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/). You can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Get started [#get-started]

To enable this integration, see [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup).

Once the integration is set up, you can find your data by going to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filtering by `aws.elastictranscoder`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon Elastic Transcoder data:

## Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up alerts to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify your team members of critical or fatal errors. For more information, see [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition).
