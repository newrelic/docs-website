<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) includes an integration for monitoring Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features [#features]

[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html) is a platform for streaming data on AWS, making it easy to load and analyze data in real time. It also gives you the ability to build custom streaming data applications for specialized needs.

New Relic's Kinesis Data Streams integration gathers metric and configuration data on all of the streams associated with your account.

Data collected includes bytes put to and retrieved from the stream, records put and retrieved, time taken by operations, and other [metrics](#metrics). You can view your Kinesis Data Streams data in pre-built dashboards and create custom queries and charts in New Relic.

You also have an option for [enabling shard data collection](#polling). AWS data records are sequentially processed in shards, which are in turn grouped in streams. The number of shards in a stream determines the total data read and write capacity of the service.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Polling and configuration [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 15 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

Shard data: To collect shard data, enable **Collect shards data** in the integration's configuration options in the UI.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you enable collecting shard data, this will increase the number of API calls to your AWS CloudWatch service. There will be seven calls per shard per polling interval.
</Callout>

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Kinesis Data Streams integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `QueueSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). The `provider` value includes:

* Stream metrics: `KinesisStream`
* Shard metrics: `KinesisStreamShard`

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following metrics. For additional information, see Amazon's documentation for [monitoring Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html).

This integration collects the following metrics:

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `getRecordsBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of bytes retrieved from the Kinesis stream, measured over the specified time period. Minimum, Maximum, and Average statistics represent the bytes in a single `GetRecords` operation for the stream in the specified time period.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `getRecordsIteratorAgeMilliseconds`
      </td>

      <td>
        The age of the last record in all `GetRecords` calls made against an Kinesis stream, measured over the specified time period, in milliseconds. Age is the difference between the current time and when the last record of the `GetRecords` call was written to the stream. The Minimum and Maximum statistics can be used to track the progress of Kinesis consumer applications. A value of zero indicates that the records being read are completely caught up with the stream.

      <td>
        `getRecordsLatency`

      <td>
        `getRecordsRecords`

        `writeProvisionedThroughputExceeded`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of records rejected due to throttling for the stream over the specified time period. This metric includes throttling from `PutRecord` and `PutRecords` operations. The most commonly used statistic for this metric is Average.

        When the Minimum statistic has a non-zero value, records were being throttled for the stream during the specified time period.

        When the Maximum statistic has a value of 0 (zero), no records were being throttled for the stream during the specified time period.
