<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

New Relic offers an integration for reporting your [Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon DocumentDB integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the following [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data):

        The average number of billed read I/O operations from a cluster volume, reported at 5-minute intervals. Billed read operations are calculated at the cluster volume level, aggregated from all instances in the cluster, and then reported at 5-minute intervals. The value is calculated by taking the value of the read operations metric over a 5-minute period. You can determine the amount of billed read operations per second by taking the value of the billed read operations metric and dividing by 300 seconds. For example, if the billed read operations returns 13,686, then the billed read operations per second is 45 (13,686 / 300 = 45.62). You accrue billed read operations for queries that request database pages that are not present in the buffer cache and therefore must be loaded from storage. You might see spikes in billed read operations as query results are read from storage and then loaded into the buffer cache.

        The average number of billed read I/O operations from a cluster volume, reported at 5-minute intervals. Billed read operations are calculated at the cluster volume level, aggregated from all instances in the cluster, and then reported at 5-minute intervals. The value is calculated by taking the value of the read operations metric over a 5-minute period. You can determine the amount of billed read operations per second by taking the value of the billed read operations metric and dividing by 300 seconds. For example, if the billed read operations returns 13,686, then the billed read operations per second is 45 (13,686 / 300 = 45.62). You accrue billed read operations for queries that request database pages that are not present in the buffer cache and therefore must be loaded from storage. You might see spikes in billed read operations as query results are read from storage and then loaded into the buffer cache.
