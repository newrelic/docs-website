[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an Amazon Elastic Classic Load Balancing (ELB) integration for reporting Classic ELB data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

New Relic's integration for [Amazon Elastic Classic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (ELB) reports ELB data, including HTTP code message counts, healthy and unhealthy host counts, latency times, and ELB configuration states. AWS integration data is also available [for querying and chart creation in New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure#insights).

Amazon offers three types of load balancers: [Classic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/classicloadbalancer/), [Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (ALB), and [Network Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (NLB). New Relic also offers an [ALB/NLB integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-alb-monitoring-integration) to monitor the last two types of load balancers.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS ELB integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use this integration's data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the ELB integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `LoadBalancerSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `Elb`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

The integration collects the following metrics. For additional details about these metrics, see [Amazon's ELB Classic Load Balancer metrics documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/elb-metricscollected.html#loadbalancing-metrics-clb).

  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `backendConnectionErrors.Sum`
      </td>

      <td>
        Rate of the number of connections per second that were not successfully established between the load balancer and the registered instances.

        The load balancer retries the connection when there are errors, so this count may exceed the request rate. This count also includes any connection errors related to health checks.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `healthyHostCount`

        `unHealthyHostCount`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of healthy or unhealthy instances registered with your load balancer. A newly registered instance is considered healthy after it passes the first health check.

        If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the number of healthy instances for the `LoadBalancerName` dimension is calculated across all availability zones. Otherwise, it is calculated per availability zone.

      <td>
        `httpCodeElb4XX`
      </td>

      <td>

      <td>
        \[HTTP listener] The number of HTTP `5XX` server error codes generated by the load balancer per minute. This count does not include any response codes generated by the registered instances. The metric is reported if there are no healthy instances registered to the load balancer, or if the request rate exceeds the capacity of the instances (spillover) or the load balancer.

        \[TCP listener] The total time elapsed, in seconds, for the load balancer to successfully establish a connection to a registered instance.

        `surgeQueueLength.Average, Maximum, Minimum`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of requests that are pending routing. The load balancer queues a request if it is unable to establish a connection with a healthy instance in order to route the request.
