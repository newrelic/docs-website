[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS Elemental MediaTailor, sending its metric data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [AWS Elemental MediaTailor](https://aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#active-integration]

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.mediatailor`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following AWS Elemental MediaTailor data:

All imported data has one dimension: `ConfigurationName`

### Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).
