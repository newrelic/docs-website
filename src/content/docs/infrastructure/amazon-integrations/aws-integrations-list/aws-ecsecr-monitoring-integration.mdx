[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ecs/) data and your [Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html) data to New Relic products. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic also offers an [ECS on-host integration](/docs/integrations/elastic-container-service-integration/get-started/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration), which reports a different data set than this cloud integration. For complete ECS monitoring, we recommend enabling both integrations.
</Callout>

## Features

With New Relic's ECS/ECR monitoring integration, you can monitor reserved vs. utilized capacity, task execution, and registry of containers. AWS integration data is also available for analysis and chart creation [in New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure#insights).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

If you have services running on ECS, you can also [enable monitoring of those services](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

<Callout variant="important">
  In AWS, you have to [opt-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#ecs-resource-arn-timeline) for the new ARN format ([announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/migrating-your-amazon-ecs-deployment-to-the-new-arn-and-resource-id-format-2/)) to differentiate services with the same name in different clusters. If not, you could have data collision
</Callout>

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon ECS/ECR integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find this integration's data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Amazon ECS/ECR integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ComputeSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type). Use a `provider` value of `EcsCluster` for cluster data, or a `provider` value of `EcsService` for cluster-service data.

The integration collects these ECR/ECS definitions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "240px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `ClusterName`
      </td>

      <td>
        This dimension filters the data you request for all resources in a specified cluster. All Amazon ECS metrics are filtered by `ClusterName`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ServiceName`
      </td>

      <td>
        This dimension filters the data you request for all resources in a specified service within a specified cluster.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Metric data [#metrics]

The ECS/ECR integration collects the following data:

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

Inventory data provides information about the service's state and configuration. For more about inventory data, see [Understand and use data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).
