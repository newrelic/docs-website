You can report your [Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ecs/) data and your [Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html) data to New Relic.

## Recommended alternatives [#alternatives]

As a preferred alternative to this integration, you can monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. To do this, enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream). 

We also offer an [ECS on-host integration](/docs/integrations/elastic-container-service-integration/get-started/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration), which reports a different data set than this cloud-based integration.

## Overview of integration [#overview]
New Relic ECS/ECR monitoring integration allows you to monitor reserved vs. utilized capacity, task execution, and registry of containers. AWS integration data is also available for [analysis and chart creation](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure#insights).


## Activate the integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow our documentation to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

If you have services running on ECS, you can also [enable monitoring of those services](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

<Callout variant="important">
  In AWS, you have to [opt-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#ecs-resource-arn-timeline) for the new ARN format ([announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/migrating-your-amazon-ecs-deployment-to-the-new-arn-and-resource-id-format-2/)) to distinguish between services with the same name in different clusters. Otherwise, you could have data collision.
</Callout>

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

The [default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) values for the Amazon ECS/ECR integration are:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find this integration's data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Amazon ECS/ECR integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ComputeSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data). Use a `provider` value of `EcsCluster` for cluster data, or a `provider` value of `EcsService` for cluster-service data.

The integration collects these ECR/ECS definitions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "240px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `ClusterName`
      </td>

      <td>
        This dimension filters the data you request for all resources in a specified cluster. All Amazon ECS metrics are filtered by `ClusterName`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ServiceName`
      </td>

      <td>
        This dimension filters the data you request for all resources in a specified service within a specified cluster.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Metric data [#metrics]

The ECS/ECR integration collects the following data:
