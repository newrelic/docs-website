[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service (SNS) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) is a managed push notification service. With New Relic's Amazon SNS integration, data reported to New Relic includes:

* Messages sent and failed counts
* Subscriptions confirmed and deleted
* Additional [metrics](#metrics)

SNS data is available in pre-built dashboards in New Relic. You can also create custom queries and charts in [New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights), and create [alert conditions](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) to notify you of changes in SNS data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations). Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon SNS integration includes:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon SNS data interval: 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To explore your [integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data):

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select any of the available SNS integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `QueueSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `SnsTopic`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following metrics. For full descriptions of some of these metrics, see [Amazon's SNS metrics and dimensions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sns-metricscollected.html).
