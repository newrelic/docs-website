[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

You can monitor and alert on your EMR data directly from [New Relic](/docs/infrastructure), and query data and create dashboards.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon EMR integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Resolution: 1 data point every 5 minutes

## Explore integration data [#find-data]

To use your [integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the EMR integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ElasticMapReduceClusterSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `ElasticMapReduceCluster`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic Infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon EMR data. For use cases and additional information, see [Amazon's EMR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics.html#UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_MetricsReported).

      <td>
        Indicates that a cluster is no longer performing work, but is still alive and accruing charges. It is set to 1 if no tasks are running and no jobs are running, and set to 0 otherwise.

        This value is checked at five-minute intervals, and a value of 1 indicates only that the cluster was idle when checked, not that it was idle for the entire five minutes. **Recommendation:** To avoid false positives, raise an alerting threshold when this value has been 1 for more than one consecutive five-minute check. For example, raise an alert on this value if it has been 1 for thirty minutes or longer.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

[Inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) provides information about the service's state and configuration. EMR configuration options are reported as inventory data.

<Callout variant="tip">
  [Cluster](#cluster_metadata) data indicated with an **\*** and all [instance](#instance_metadata), [instance-fleet](#instance_fleet_metadata), and [instance-group](#instance_group_metadata) metadata are only fetched if [extended inventory collection](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations#extended) is on.
