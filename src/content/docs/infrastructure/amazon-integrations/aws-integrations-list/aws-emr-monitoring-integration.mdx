<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features [#features]

You can monitor and alert on your EMR data directly from [New Relic](/docs/infrastructure), and query data and create dashboards.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon EMR integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Resolution: 1 data point every 5 minutes

## Explore integration data [#find-data]

To use your [integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select one of the EMR integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `ElasticMapReduceClusterSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `ElasticMapReduceCluster`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon EMR data. For use cases and additional information, see [Amazon's EMR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics.html#UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_MetricsReported).

      </td>

      <td>
        Indicates that a cluster is no longer performing work, but is still alive and accruing charges. It is set to 1 if no tasks are running and no jobs are running, and set to 0 otherwise.

        This value is checked at five-minute intervals, and a value of 1 indicates only that the cluster was idle when checked, not that it was idle for the entire five minutes. Recommendation: To avoid false positives, raise an alerting threshold when this value has been 1 for more than one consecutive five-minute check. For example, raise an alert on this value if it has been 1 for thirty minutes or longer.
