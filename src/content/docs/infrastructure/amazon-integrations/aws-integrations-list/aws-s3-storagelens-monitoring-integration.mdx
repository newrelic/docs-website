<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon S3 data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (Amazon S3) provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable cloud storage.

With New Relic's Amazon S3 storage lens integration, data reported includes S3 bucket size, bucket object counts, GET requests, POST requests, and other [metrics](#metrics). S3 data is available in pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/>, and you can also create [custom queries and charts](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can also create alert conditions to notify you of changes in S3 data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

<Callout variant="important">
  [Request and Data Transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/configure-metrics.html) metrics are premium and paid for separately through AWS. For CloudWatch pricing information, see Amazon's [S3 enhanced monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html) documentation.
</Callout>

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**</DNT> and select one of the S3 integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) in the metric explorer by searching for `storagelens` in the search finder bar.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects Amazon S3 storage lens metrics. For more details about these metrics, see [Amazon's S3 Storage Lens documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_basics_metrics_recommendations.html).
