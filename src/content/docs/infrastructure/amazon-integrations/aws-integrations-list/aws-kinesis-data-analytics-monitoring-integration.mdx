Our [Infrastructure monitoring integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS Kinesis Data Analytics data to our products. Read on to learn more about how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Kinesis Data Analytics integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select an integration.

Data is attached to the following [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):
