[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
include an integration for sending your AWS Internet Monitor reported data to the New Relic platform. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features [#features]

You can collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html)
using our integration. Once integrated you can monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and data transfer [#configure]

We have two options for reporting data. We recommend using [streaming data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export) but [polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) is also supported. 

If you choose polling, it's possible to adjust polling frequency using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations). [Default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for AWS integrations:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Data from this integration is attached to the `Metric` data type. To see your data: go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.internetmonitor`.

## Tips on using your data [#use-data]

You can create alerts to notify you of any developing changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).
