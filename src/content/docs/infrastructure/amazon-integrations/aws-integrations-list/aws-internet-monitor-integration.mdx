Our AWS CloudWatch Internet Monitor integration reports your CloudWatch Internet Monitor data to the New Relic platform.

## Features [#features]

With this integration, you can collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [CloudWatch Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html). Once integrated you can monitor your services, query incoming data, monitor logs, and use pre-built dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Get metrics data [#get-metrics-data]

We have two options for reporting this data. The recommended path is setting up our [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream). Alternatively, you can use our [older Amazon integration that relies on polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

## Get logs data [#get-logs-data]

Logs data can be reported to New Relic using our [Log ingestion Lambda](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs). Be sure to [add triggers](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs/#create-trigger) to the Lambda and select the log group corresponding to `internet-monitor` at `country`, `city`, `subdivision`, and `metro` level.

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Metrics data from this integration is attached to the `Metric` data type. To see your data: go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.internetmonitor`.

## Tips on using your data [#use-data]

You can create <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you of any developing changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).
