[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) now include an integration for AWS API Gateway v2, sending its metrics data to New Relic.

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data you can report.

## Features [#features]

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon API Gateway v2](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) using our integration. Check your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate-integration]

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics & Events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.apigateway`.

## Metric data [#metric-data]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon API Gateway v2 metrics:

### Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up alerts to receive a notification if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to get a notification about relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.

Learn more about creating alerts [here](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-an-alert/).
