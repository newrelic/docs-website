[CloudWatch Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Application_Signals.html) is an available option by AWS to monitor your AWS hosted services. The data is available in New Relic through CloudWatch Metric Stream.

## Activate the integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, see how to [set CloudWatch metric stream to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

To find your integration's metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events**</DNT> and filter by `aws.applicationsignals`.

## Available metric data [#metric-data]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "220px" }}>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>
        Unit  

      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `Latency`
      </td>

      <td>
        Ms
      </td>

      <td>
        The delay before data transfer begins after the request is made.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Faults`
      </td>

      <td>
        Count
      </td>

      <td>
        A count of both HTTP 5XX server-side faults and OpenTelemetry span status errors.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `Errors`
      </td>

      <td>
        Count
      </td>

      <td>
        A count of HTTP 4XX client-side errors. These are considered to be request errors that are not caused by service problems. Therefore, the Availability metric displayed on Application Signals dashboards does not regard these errors as service faults.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Create alerts [#create-alerts]

You can set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> to notify you if there are any changes. For example, you can set up an alert to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
