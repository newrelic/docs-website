[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon Route 53 data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

[Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) helps you register domain names, route Internet traffic to the appropriate resources, and check the health of your resources to make sure your web app is always up and running.

For AWS health-checks, Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following criteria:

* By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check
* By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)
* By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

Data reported to New Relic includes connection time, health checks, time to first byte, and other [metrics](#metrics). Route 53 data is available in pre-built dashboards and you can also create custom queries and charts in [New Relic One](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon Route 53 integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the Route 53 integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `HealthCheckSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `Route53HealthCheck`.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

New Relic Infrastructure Integrations supports the following Route 53 health check metrics. For more details on these metrics, see [Amazon's Route 53 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/r53-metricscollected_shared.html).

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com).
</Callout>

This integration collects the following Amazon Route 53 inventory data under the key `aws/route53`. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).
