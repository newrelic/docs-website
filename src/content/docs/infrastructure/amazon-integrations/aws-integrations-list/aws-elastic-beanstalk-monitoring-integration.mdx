[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an AWS [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) integration for reporting your Beanstalk data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a dynamic service that allows easy deployment and scalability for your applications. The "application" in AWS Beanstalk is the environment. An "application" can have several environments associated with it.

## Requirements

AWS Elastic Beanstalk will send some basic metrics to Amazon CloudWatch by default. Additionally, you can enable enhanced health reporting as custom metrics; enabling these metrics may add additional charges to your Amazon CloudWatch account pricing. To enable enhanced CloudWatch metrics, see [Publishing Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics for an environment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/health-enhanced-cloudwatch.html).

## Activate integration [#activate]

By default, no metrics are selected in the Elastic Beanstalk settings. You must select them for **each** environment to generate metrics in the New Relic UI. If no metrics are selected, no data will be reported to New Relic.

To enable this integration:

1. Follow the instructions in [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).
2. Update your Elastic Beanstalk settings to select which metrics (default is no metrics) to watch for **each** environment: In the AWS Elastic Beanstalk UI, go to **Configuration > Health**, then configure the CloudWatch custom metrics for health reporting.

After you select the metrics you want to be reported for each environment, Elastic Beanstalk will generate inventory data from the moment both `instance` and `environment` data objects are created.

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the [polling frequency](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default polling information for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

To [view and use your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the AWS Elastic Beanstalk integration links.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

Inventory data provides information about the service's state and configuration. For more about inventory data, see [Understand and use data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Data indicated with an asterisk `*` is only fetched if [extended inventory collection](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations#extended) is on.
