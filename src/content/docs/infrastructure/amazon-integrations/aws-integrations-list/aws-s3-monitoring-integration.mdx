<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon S3 data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features [#features]

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable cloud storage.

With New Relic's Amazon S3 integration, data reported includes S3 bucket size, bucket object counts, GET requests, POST requests, and other [metrics](#metrics). S3 data is available in pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and you can also create [custom queries and charts](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can also create alert conditions to notify you of changes in S3 data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

<Callout variant="important">
  [Request and Data Transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/configure-metrics.html) metrics are premium metrics and paid for separately through AWS. For CloudWatch pricing information, see Amazon's [S3 enhanced monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html) documentation.
</Callout>

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon S3 integration:

* New Relic polling intervals:
  * S3 buckets: 1 hour
  * S3 requests: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch polling intervals:
  * S3 buckets: 24 hours
  * S3 requests: 1 minute

Note that changing the polling interval for this integration will only affect data collection for S3 request metrics.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the S3 integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `DatastoreSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `S3Bucket`.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following Amazon S3 metrics. For more details about these metrics, see [Amazon's S3 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html#s3-cloudwatch-metrics).

### Amazon S3 data for buckets [#provider-S3Bucket]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={285}>
        **Metric**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `BucketSizeBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        The amount of data in bytes stored in a bucket including Standard Storage, Reduced Redundancy Storage, Infrequent Access Storage (IAS), One zone IAS, and Glacier Storage including overheads.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NumberOfObjects`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of objects stored in a bucket for all storage classes except for the `GLACIER` storage class.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Amazon S3 data for request metrics [#provider-S3BucketRequests]

To collect these metrics, you must enable request metrics for your S3 bucket:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Metric**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `AllRequests`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of HTTP requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, regardless of type. When using a metrics configuration with a filter, then this metric only counts HTTP requests from objects that meet the filter's requirements. If creating multiple bucket metric filters, you must create a filter scoped to all the objects in the bucket as detailed in [these AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html). Note that **only** that filter should be scoped to all objects in the bucket. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `GetRequests`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of HTTP GET requests made for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. This doesn't include list operations.

      <td>
        `PutRequests`

      <td>
        `DeleteRequests`
      </td>

        The number of HTTP DELETE requests made for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. This also includes [Delete Multiple Objects](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/multiobjectdeleteapi.html) requests. This metric shows the number of requests, not the number of objects deleted.

        Valid statistics: Average (bytes per request), Sum (bytes per period), Sample Count, Min, Max
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `4xxErrors`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of HTTP 4xx client error status code requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket with a value of either `0` or `1`. The `average` statistic shows the error rate, and the `sum` statistic shows the count of that type of error, during each period.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `FirstByteLatency`
      </td>

      <td>
        The per-request time, in milliseconds, from the time the S3 bucket received a complete request to the time the response started to be returned.

        Valid statistics: Average, Sum, Min, Max, Sample Count
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `TotalRequestLatency`
      </td>

      <td>
        The elapsed per-request time, in milliseconds, from the first byte received to the last byte sent to an Amazon S3 bucket. This includes the time taken to receive the request body and send the response body, which is not included in `FirstByteLatency`.

        Valid statistics: Average, Sum, Min, Max, Sample Count
      </td>
    </tr>
