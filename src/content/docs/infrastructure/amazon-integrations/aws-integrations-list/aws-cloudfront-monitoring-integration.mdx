<Callout variant="important">
  Enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/) to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. Individual integrations are no longer our recommended option.
</Callout>

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting Amazon CloudFront service data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features [#features]

[Amazon CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) is an Amazon web service that speeds up the distribution of your web content. With the New Relic CloudFront integration, you can track CloudFront data in New Relic, including error rates, request counts, and uploaded/downloaded bytes. You can track your CloudFront configuration and see how configuration changes impact performance. You can also create custom queries of your CloudFront integration data and custom charts.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon CloudFront integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: [1 minute](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html), with up to 1 minute delay because CloudFront sometimes reports partial data

If you're using Lambda@Edge to customize content that CloudFront delivers so to execute Lambda functions in AWS locations closer to your clients, you can enable the **Collect Lambda@Edge data** filter in order to get Lambda execution location metadata.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the CloudFront integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `LoadBalancerSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `CloudFrontDistribution`.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The following data is collected for [CloudFront Web distributions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web.html). Data is not available for [RTMP distributions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-rtmp.html).
