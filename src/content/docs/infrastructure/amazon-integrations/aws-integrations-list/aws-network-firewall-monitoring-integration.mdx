New Relic infrastructure integrations now include an integration that sends your AWS Network Firewall metrics to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data is available for reporting.

## Features [#features]

The AWS Network Firewall Metrics integration collects and sends telemetry data to New Relic from your AWS Network Firewall. You can monitor your AWS services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate-ingration]

To enable this integration, follow the instructions in our [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration documentation](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup/).

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration's metrics:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>
2. Select <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>
3. Filter by `aws.networkfirewall`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following AWS Network Firewall metrics:
