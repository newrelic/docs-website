New Relic offers an integration for reporting your [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) data. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Direct Connect integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > AWS** and select an integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the following [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity

        The number of times cyclic redundancy check (CRC) errors are observed for the data received at the AWS device. This metric is a counter that might remain the same for an extended period of time because it is only reset when the device is reset. If this value does not increase, then there are no errors occurring.
