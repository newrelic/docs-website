## Problem

You want to [integrate your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services](/docs/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations) with New Relic, but you see API authentication errors.

## Solution

To resolve the problem:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > GCP**.
2. From your GCP account page, select **Reauthorize New Relic**.
3. Follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-new-relic/#connect).

## Cause

Common reasons for this error include:

* The authorization for New Relic to use GCP APIs has been revoked manually by the user from the Google account management application.
* The authorization for New Relic to use GCP APIs does not include one or more of the permissions ([Google OAuth scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes)) needed to query one or more of the GCP APIs.
* The authorization for New Relic to use GCP APIs has expired.
