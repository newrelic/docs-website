Our [infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) includes one that reports [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) data to our products. This document explains how to activate the GCP Cloud Functions integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

Google Cloud Functions service allows running code in a serverless way. Using the [Google UI](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstarts), developers can create short pieces of code that are intended to do a specific function. The function can then respond to cloud events without the need to manage an application server or runtime environment.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

Our integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration.

* Polling frequency for GCP Cloud Functions: five minutes
* Resolution: one data point every minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and then waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the UI. To [view and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP**, then select an integration.

## Metric data [#metrics]

[Metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#data-types) we receive from your GCP Cloud Functions integration includes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `function.Executions`
      </td>

      <td>
        Count of functions that executed, by status.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `function.ExecutionTimeNanos`
      </td>

      <td>
        Time for each function to execute, in nanoseconds.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `function.UserMemoryBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        Memory used for each function, in bytes.
      </td>
    </tr>
