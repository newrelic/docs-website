Our [infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) includes one that reports [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) data to our products. This document explains how to activate the GCP Cloud Functions integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

Google Cloud Functions service allows running code in a serverless way. Using the [Google UI](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstarts), developers can create short pieces of code that are intended to do a specific function. The function can then respond to cloud events without the need to manage an application server or runtime environment.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

Our integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration.

* Polling frequency for GCP Cloud Functions: five minutes
* Resolution: one data point every minute

## View and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and then waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the UI. To [view and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com)**, in top nav click **Infrastructure**, click **GCP**, then **(select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

[Metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#data-types) we receive from your GCP Cloud Functions integration includes:

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="EOL NOTICE"
>
  After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).

[Inventory data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data) we receive from your GCP Cloud Functions integration includes the following inventory.

Inventory indicated with `*` are fetched only when the GCP project is linked to New Relic through a service account.
