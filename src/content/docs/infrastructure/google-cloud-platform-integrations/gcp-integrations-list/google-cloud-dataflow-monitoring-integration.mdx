[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your GCP Dataflow data to our products. Here we explain how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/polling-intervals-gcp-integrations) information for the GCP Dataflow integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP**</DNT> and select an integration.

Data is attached to the following [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity
      </th>

      <th>
        Event Type
      </th>

      <th>
        Provider
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Job
      </td>

      <td>
        `GcpDataflowJobSample`
      </td>

      <td>
        `GcpDataflowJob`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects GCP Dataflow data for Job.
