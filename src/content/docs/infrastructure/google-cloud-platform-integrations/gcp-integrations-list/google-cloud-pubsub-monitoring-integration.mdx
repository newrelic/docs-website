[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) include an integration to report [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the GCP Pub/Sub integration and describes the data that will be reported.

## Features

As part of the Google Cloud [stream analytics solution](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/stream-analytics), the Cloud Pub/Sub service ingests and delivers event streams for quick data processing and analysis.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling frequency for Google Cloud Pub/Sub is five minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

Pub/Sub topics are named entities that represent feeds of messages, and subscriptions are named entities that represent message destinations on a particular topic.

To view [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for your GCP Pub/Sub integration in New Relic, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `GcpPubSubTopicSample` and `GcpPubSubSubscriptionSample` [events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type) and their related attributes.
