New Relic's integrations with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) include an integration to report [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the Google BigQuery integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

Google BigQuery is a data warehouse with no infrastructure to manage. With BigQuery you can specify the data schema, or allow the service to discover it for you. You can explore your data using SQL queries.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query GCP services according to a polling interval that varies depending on the integration. The polling frequency for the Google BigQuery integration is five minutes. For information about the resolution, see [metric data details](#metrics).

## Activate Table metrics [#table-metrics]

The collection of BigQuery table metrics is disabled by default. This affects the metrics listed under [GcpBigQueryTableSample](#table-sample). To collect those metrics, turn on the "Enable table metrics" setting under the configuration menu of the BigQuery integration.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

To view [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for your Google BigQuery integration in New Relic, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `GcpBigQueryProjectSample`, `GcpBigQueryDatasetSample`, and `GcpBigQueryTableSample` [events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#event) and their attributes.

### GcpBigQueryProjectSample [#project-sample]
