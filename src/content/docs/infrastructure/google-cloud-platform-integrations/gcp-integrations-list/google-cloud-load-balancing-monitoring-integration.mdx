[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com) include an integration to report [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the GCP Cloud Load Balancing integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

Google Cloud Load Balancing is a software-based managed service for distributing traffic in a single or multiple region. It provides seamless, immediate autoscaling and supports the latest application delivery protocols.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling frequency for Google Cloud Load Balancer is five minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

To view [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for your GCP Load Balancing integration in New Relic, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `GcpHttpLoadBalancerSample`, `GcpTcpSslProxyLoadBalancerSample`, and `GcpInternalLoadBalancerSample` [events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) and their related attributes.
