[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your GCP Run data to our products. Here we explain how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/polling-intervals-gcp-integrations) information for the GCP Run integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > GCP** and select an integration.

Data is attached to the following [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Entity
      </th>

      <th>
        Event Type

      <th>
        Provider

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Revision
      </td>

      <td>

      <td>
        `GcpRunRevision`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects GCP Run data for Revision.

        `container.BillableInstanceTime`
      </td>

      <td>
        Seconds
      </td>

      <td>
        Billable time aggregated from all container instances of the revision. For a given container instance, billable time occurs when the container instance is starting or at least one request is being processed. Billable time is rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds. Examples: If a revision with 2 container instances has been continuously serving traffic in the last minute, the value is 2s/s with the default "rate" aligner. If a single request lasting 30ms was received by a revision in the past minute, it is rounded up to 100ms and averaged to 1.7ms/s over the minute with the default "rate" aligner.
