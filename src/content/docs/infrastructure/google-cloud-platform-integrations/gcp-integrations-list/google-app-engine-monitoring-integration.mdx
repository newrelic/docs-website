New Relic offers an [integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) that fetches data about your [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) services so that you can view the data in the New Relic UI.

For more information about monitoring applications that **reside in** a Google App Engine environment with <InlinePopover type="apm" /> (instead of how to monitor your Google App Engine services), see [Google App Engine environment](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/partner-based-installation/google-app-engine-environment).

## Features of the Google App Engine integration [#features]

You can use the Google App Engine integration to view charts and set alerts for your Google App Engine services in New Relic and to [create custom queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). Google App Engine is a Google Cloud Platform service that abstracts away the underlying infrastructure for your mobile and web applications, allowing you to focus on their development.

* The **Google App Engine Standard environment** provides a set of preconfigured runtimes and is suitable for applications that require fully-managed, fast scaling.
* The **Google App Engine Flexible environment** runs applications within Docker containers and is suitable for applications that require configurable, gradual scaling.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic queries your Google App Engine services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After [connecting the Google App Engine integration to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure) and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), you can [find and use integration data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/):

## Metric data [#metrics]

To view [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for your Google App Engine integration in New Relic, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `GcpAppEngineServiceSample` and `GcpCloudTasksQueueSample` [events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) and their related attributes.

<Callout variant="important">
  Different metrics are available depending on whether your application is running in a [standard or flexible environment](#environments), so some metrics may not be available for your application.
