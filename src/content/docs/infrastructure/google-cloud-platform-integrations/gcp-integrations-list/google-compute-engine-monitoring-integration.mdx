You can use New Relic's Compute Engine integration to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status.

Our integration with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) reports metadata about instances (virtual machines) hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GCP instances data using [New Relic infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure), and you can create custom queries and charts in New Relic.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

<Callout variant="important">
  You must install the infrastructure agent on each GCE host to see [metrics](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events) from that host. Connecting your Google Cloud projects allows New Relic to access GCE metadata, such as region, type, and tags.
</Callout>

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic queries your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Compute Engine integration is 5 minutes.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> and alert settings, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**</DNT>.

## Metric data [#metrics]

[Metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#data-types) that New Relic receives from your GCP Compute Engine integration include:
