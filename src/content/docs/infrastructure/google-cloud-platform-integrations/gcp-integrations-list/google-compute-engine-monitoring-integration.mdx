You can use New Relic's Compute Engine integration to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status.

Our integration with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) reports metadata about instances (virtual machines) hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GCP instances data using [New Relic infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure), and you can create custom queries and charts in New Relic.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

<Callout variant="important">
  You must install the infrastructure agent on each GCE host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Google Cloud projects allows New Relic to access GCE metadata, such as region, type, and tags.
</Callout>

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic queries your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Compute Engine integration is 5 minutes.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

[Metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#data-types) that New Relic receives from your GCP Compute Engine integration include:
