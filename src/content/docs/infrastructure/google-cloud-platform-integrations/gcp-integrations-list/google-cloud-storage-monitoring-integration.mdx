New Relic offers an [integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) for reporting your Google Cloud Storage data to New Relic. Learn how to [connect this integration to infrastructure monitoring](#connect) and about the [metric data](#metrics) that New Relic reports for this integration.

## Features

Google Cloud Storage is a Google Cloud Platform service that you can use to serve website content, to store data for archival and disaster recovery, and to distribute data objects via direct download. With the Google Cloud Storage integration, you can access these features:

* View charts and information about the data you are storing and retrieving from Google Cloud Storage.
* [Create custom queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) in from automatically captured [data](#metrics).
* Set [alerts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration) on your Google Cloud Storage data directly from the Integrations page.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic queries your Google Cloud Storage services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After connecting the integration to New Relic and waiting a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use integration data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/), including your dashb<InlinePopover type="dashboards" />oards and your alert settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage**.

To create custom dashboards for the integration, [create queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights) for the `GcpStorageBucketSample` event type with the provider value `GcpStorageBucket`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

The integration reports [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for all values of `method` and `response_code`:

* `response_code`: The response code of the requests.
* `method`: The name of the API method called.

The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

        `api.Requests`
      </td>

      <td>
        Delta count of API calls.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `network.ReceivedBytes`

      <td>
        Delta count of bytes received over the network.

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>
