[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) include an integration to report [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/) data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the GCP SQL integration and describes the data that can be reported.

## Features

Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that is used to set up, maintain, manage, and administer MySQL and PostgreSQL databases in the cloud. Cloud SQL offers high performance and scalability, and can be accessed from most applications.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling frequency for Google Cloud SQL is five minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

To view [metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) for your GCP SQL integration in New Relic, [create NRQL queries](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights#nrql) for `GcpCloudSqlSample` [events](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type) and their related attributes.

### GcpCloudSqlSample [#gcp-app-cloud-sql-sample]
