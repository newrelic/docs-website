[New Relic's integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) reports data about clusters hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GKE instances data from [New Relic's Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure), and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards in [New Relic One](/docs/insights).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration:

1. Make sure you have [installed the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation) before activating GCP integrations from your Infrastructure account.
2. Follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Kubernetes Engine integration is 5 minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

The data New Relic receives from your Google Kubernetes Engine integration includes the following metric data. For more on these metrics, see Google's documentation on [Metrics for Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-container).

### GcpKubernetesContainerSample [#GcpKubernetesContainer]

New Relic receives the following data from your GCP Kubernetes Engine integration and it is reported to a `GcpKubernetesContainerSample` event type with the provider value `GcpKubernetesContainer`. The `container/accelerator` metrics are only available the experimental mode on kubernetes is enabled, and gpu has been added to your cluster and container. Query `GcpKubernetesContainerSample` events to view data for the following attributes:

## Inventory data [#inventory]

<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
After March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including inventory data for cloud integrations. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

[Inventory data](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/understand-use-data-infrastructure-integrations#overview) is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. You can examine inventory data in New Relic One.

The Google Kubernetes Engine integration reports configuration information for cluster objects with the following properties. Additionally, container labels are propagated to nodes and pods.

### gcp/kubernetes/container [#inventory-virtual-machine]

* `clusterName`
* `containerName`
* `podId`
* `namespaceId`
* `instanceId`
* `project`
* `zone`

### gcp/kubernetes/node [#inventory-node]

* `clusterName`
* `nodeName`
* `project`
* `zone`

### gcp/kubernetes/pod [#inventory-pod]

* `clusterName`
* `podName`
* `namespace`
* `project`
* `zone`
