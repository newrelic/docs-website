[New Relic's integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) with [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) reports data about clusters hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GKE instances data from our [infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure), and you can create [custom queries and chart dashboards](/docs/insights).

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable the integration:

1. Make sure you have [installed the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation) before activating GCP integrations from New Relic.
2. Follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure).

## Polling frequency [#polling]

New Relic integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Kubernetes Engine integration is 5 minutes. The resolution is 1 data point every minute.

## Find and use data [#find-data]

After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the [polling frequency](#polling)), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), including links to your <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> and alert settings, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration)**</DNT>.

## Metric data [#metrics]

The data New Relic receives from your Google Kubernetes Engine integration includes the following metric data. For more on these metrics, see Google's documentation on [Metrics for Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-container).

### GcpKubernetesContainerSample [#GcpKubernetesContainer]

New Relic receives the following data from your GCP Kubernetes Engine integration and it is reported to a `GcpKubernetesContainerSample` event type with the provider value `GcpKubernetesContainer`. The `container/accelerator` metrics are only available the experimental mode on kubernetes is enabled, and gpu has been added to your cluster and container. Query `GcpKubernetesContainerSample` events to view data for the following attributes:
