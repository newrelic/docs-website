[New Relic infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure) integrations monitor the performance of popular products and services. New Relic's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integrations let you monitor your GCP data in several New Relic features.

## Connect GCP and New Relic [#connect]

In order to obtain GCP data, follow standard procedures to [connect your GCP service to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/gcp-integrations).

## View your GCP data [#insights]

Once you follow the configuration process, data from your Google Cloud Platform account will report directly to New Relic.

To view your GCP data: Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > GCP**. For any of the integrations listed:

* Select an integration name to view data in a pre-configured dashboard.

  OR
* Select the **Explore data** <Icon name="fe-database"/>
  icon to view GCP data.

You can view and reuse the Insights NRQL queries both in the pre-configured dashboards and in the **Events explorer** dashboards. This allows you to tailor queries to your specific needs.

Inventory, events, and dashboards for all services are available in New Relic.
