Monitor Apache Airflow data by configuring [OpenTelemetry](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html#setup-opentelemetry) to send data to New Relic, where you can visualize tasks, operators, and DAG executions as metrics.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before enabling OpenTelemetry in Apache Airflow, you'll need to install the Airflow package with the `otel` extra. The installation method depends on your Airflow deployment approach:

### Option 1: Installing from PyPi [#install-pypi]

1. Follow the installation instructions from [Airflow's Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/installing-from-pypi.html).
2. When installing with pip, add the `otel` extra to the command. For example:

   ```sh
   pip install "apache-airflow[otel]"
   ```

### Option 2: Installing from Docker [#install-docker]

1. Set up the Airflow Docker image using instructions from [Airflow's documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html).
2. Extend the pre-built Docker image by using a Dockerfile to install the `otel` extra. You can replace the latest tag with your desired version of the image.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM apache/airflow:latest
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "apache-airflow[otel]==$AIRFLOW_VERSION"
   ```

<Callout variant="tip">
  `$AIRFLOW_VERSION` is already set by the apache/airflow container, but can be replaced with a version number for other base images.
</Callout>

## Configuration [#configuration]

To send Airflow metrics to New Relic, configure the OpenTelemetry metrics to export data to an [OpenTelemetry collector](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-intro/), which will then forward the data to a New Relic [OTLP endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#note-endpoints) using a <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>.

<Callout variant="important">
  Due to Airflow's current lack of support for sending OpenTelemetry data with authentication headers, the OpenTelemetry collector is essential for authenticating with New Relic.
</Callout>

### Configure the OpenTelemetry collector [#configuration-collector]

1. Follow the [basic collector example](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic/) to set up your OpenTelemetry collector.
2. Configure the collector with your appropriate OTLP endpoint, such as `https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317`.
3. For authentication, add your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> to the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` so that it populates the `api-key` header.
4. Ensure port 4318 on the collector is reachable from the running Airflow instance. (For docker, you may need to use a [docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network/).)
5. Launch the collector.

### Configure Airflow metrics [#configuration-airflow]

Airflow sends metrics using OTLP over HTTP, which uses port `4318`. Airflow has multiple methods of [setting configuration options](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-config.html).

<Callout variant="important">
  If your environment has Airflow running in a docker container alongside the OpenTelemetry Collector, you will need to change the `otel_host` setting from `localhost` to the container address of the collector.
</Callout>

Choose one of the following methods to set the required options for Airflow.

1. Set the required options in the `airflow.cfg` file.

   ```ini
   [metrics]
   otel_on = True
   otel_host = localhost
   otel_port = 4318
   otel_ssl_active = False
   ```

2. Or, set the required options as environment variables.

   ```sh
   export AIRFLOW__METRICS__OTEL_ON=True
   export AIRFLOW__METRICS__OTEL_HOST=localhost
   export AIRFLOW__METRICS__OTEL_PORT=4318
   export AIRFLOW__METRICS__OTEL_SSL_ACTIVE=False
   ```

<Callout variant="tip">
  Airflow has [additional settings](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html#setup-opentelemetry) for metrics that may be useful. This includes the ability to [rename metrics](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html#rename-metrics) before sending, which is helpful if metric names exceed the 63 byte limit for OpenTelemetry.
</Callout>

## Validate data is sent to New Relic [#validation]

To confirm New Relic is collecting your Airflow data, run a DAG or pipeline:

1. Login to Airflow.
2. Click the run button on one of the existing tutorial DAGs, or your own.
3. Wait for the pipeline to finish running.
4. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > Services - OpenTelemetry > Airflow**</DNT>.
5. Click <DNT>**Metrics Explorer**</DNT> to visualize metrics for pipeline executions.

## Building dashboards [#building-dashboards]

With Airflow metrics, you can build dashboards around individual pipelines, overall performance, or view a comparison between different pipelines. Click here to learn more about [querying your metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-metric-data-type/).

This query retrieves a list of all reported metrics for Airflow:

```sql
SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric WHERE entity.name = 'Airflow' 
AND metricName LIKE 'airflow.%' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO LIMIT 100
```

Make sure to change the limit (`100`) if your metric names exceed it.

This query shows a comparison of different completion times for successful runs of different DAGs:

```sql
SELECT latest(airflow.dagrun.duration.success) FROM Metric 
FACET dag_id WHERE entity.name = 'Airflow' SINCE 30 minutes AGO TIMESERIES
```

This query shows counts of failed DAG runs, which can be used to build <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> for critical pipelines:

```sql
SELECT count(airflow.dagrun.duration.failed) FROM Metric 
FACET dag_id WHERE entity.name = 'Airflow' SINCE 30 minutes AGO TIMESERIES
```

<Callout variant="important">
  Airflow's OpenTelemetry metrics are not maintained by New Relic, so if you have any issues with the instrumentation, [create a new issue in Airflow's GitHub repo](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues).
