New Relic Service Broker for VMware Tanzu enables you to use one or more New Relic accounts and is deployed as a Java app on VMware Tanzu. A service broker allows Cloud Foundry apps to bind to services and consume the services easily from the Apps Manager or from the command line.

## How it works [#works]

The broker exposes the New Relic service on the Marketplace and allows users to directly create a service instance and bind it to their apps either from Apps Manager or from the command line.

The New Relic Service Broker for VMware Tanzu tile installs the New Relic Service Broker as an app, registers it as a service broker on VMware Tanzu, and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Each service plan is associated with an existing New Relic account, which is configured during the tile setup.

Selecting a plan binds your app with the New Relic agent, and the agent starts reporting to the New Relic account which is associated with the selected plan. This makes the installation and subsequent use of New Relic on your VMware Tanzu apps easier and more straightforward.

## Prerequisites [#prereqs]

New Relic Nozzle for VMware Tanzu has the following requirements:

* Service broker v1.12.18 and later
* For service brokers on v1.12.12 and earlier, the unique GUIDs for plans were calculated differently. For these plans to not break compatibility, the GUIDs must be the same as before. The migration script preserves the plan GUIDs for existing plans in the plan collection for v1.12.12 and earlier.

<Collapser
  id="broker-legacy"
  title="Obtain key for service brokers v1.12.12  and earlier"
>
  You need to override your plan GUID if you've changed the original license key that was associated with a service broker on v1.12.12 or earlier. To obtain the original plan GUID from Cloud Controller, run the following script:

  ```shell
     cf curl $(cf curl /v2/services?q=label:newrelic | grep “service_plans_url” |

      awk ‘{print $2}’ | sed ‘s/[",]//g’) | egrep “"name":|"unique_id":” |

      sed ‘s/[",]//g’ | tr -s " " | awk ’ {name=$0; getline; printf(\t%-40s %-40s \n”,name,$0)}’
  ```

  There are two new properties labeled pre-1.12.12 plan? and Plan Guid Override (broker 1.12.12 or older) in the plan collection for each plan in the tile configuration. Don't change either of these properties because they're set internally where required.

  * In New Relic Service Broker v1.12.13 and later, leave pre-1.12.12 plan unchecked, and Plan Guid Override blank.
  * The tile is supported on Ops Manager v2.9.x, v2.10.x, and v3.0.x.
  * You can install the tile on any of these versions, and upgrade from v1.9.x to any Ops Manager version up to and including v3.x.
  * No upgrade paths are required for older versions of the tile, since versions older than v1.9.0 are not supported.
  * v1.12.6 and later of the tile support migration from older versions of the tile, and preserve existing services and service plans.
  * If you are using tiles older than v1.11.4, you must first upgrade to v1.11.4, then to v1.12.9, then to the latest version of the tile.

The current tile removes the `all_open` security group from the tile default security settings. If you are using a previous versions of the tile, make your VMware Tanzu environment more secure by removing the `all_open` security group from the Application Security Group (ASG) settings. The new version of the tile doesn't open the security, nor does it close the security if it was already open.

## Configure with HTTP proxy [#configure-http]

If the VMware Tanzu environment needs to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy for external outbound communication, the service broker itself doesn't need to know anything about the HTTP proxy,
as it relays the license keys to the consumer apps. The consumer app should specify the `http\_proxy` or `https\_proxy` as an environment variable for the agent to communicate externally with non-Java apps,
and use `JAVA_OPTS` for Java apps. In addition, the New Relic Agent should also be configured with its own
set of parameters `(-Dnewrelic.config.\*)` to communicate with its controller through the proxy for Java language apps.

To specify using `http_proxy` for the New Relic non-Java app agent to talk to its controller using the proxy, run the following commands:

```shell
cf set-env APPNAME http_proxy 'http://user:password@proxy-server.customer.example.com:8080'
cf set-env APPNAME https_proxy 'http://user:password@proxy-server.customer.example.com:8080'
```

To specify using `JAVA_OPTS` for the New Relic Java agent to talk to its controller using the proxy, run the following command:

```shell
cf set-env APPNAME JAVA_OPTS " -Dtest.value=barbar
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_host=proxy.customer.example.com
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_port=8080
```

If a Java app also needs to talk through a proxy,
add the Java proxy settings in addition to the New Relic agent proxy settings with the following command:

```shell
cf set-env APPNAME JAVA_OPTS " -Dtest.value=barbar
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_host=proxy.customer.example.com
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_port=8080
  -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.customer.example.com-Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
  -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.customer.example.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080
```

For a non-Java app that needs to talk outbound using a proxy, run the following commands:

```shell
cf set-env APPNAME http_proxy http://user@password:myproxy....:8080/
cf set-env APPNAME https_proxy https://user@password:myproxy....:8080/
```

Whenever making changes to Cloud Foundry environment variables, you must restage your app(s) to make the changes effective.

```shell
cf restage APPNAME
```

You can set these  environment variables individually per app, or with environment variable groups to be set for all apps as part of staging, running environments, etc. using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool.

## Environment variable groups [#variable-groups]

* `running-environment-variable-group/revg`: Retrieve the contents of the running environment variable group
* `staging-environment-variable-group/sevg`: Retrieve the contents of the staging environment variable group
* `set-staging-environment-variable-group/ssevg`: Pass parameters as JSON to create a staging environment variable group
* `set-running-environment-variable-group/srevg`: Pass parameters as JSON to create a running environment variable group

Use the `JAVA\_OPTS` environment variable to specify New Relic Agent-specific environment variables in the staging environment group so the Java buildpack can use that and push it in the correct place. Specifying JAVA_OPTS in the Runtime environment variable group won't yield anything, as the buildpack won't know about it.

For example:

```shell
cf ssevg '{ "JAVA_OPTS" : " -Dtest.value=barbar
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_host=proxy.customer.example.com
  -Dnewrelic.config.proxy_port=8080 -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.customer.example.com
  -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.customer.example.com
  -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
  -Dnewrelic.config.log_level=finer
  -Djavax.net.debug=all ", "test_env_profile" : "Staging" }'
```

## Package dependencies for Offline Buildpacks [#product-dependencies]

If you're running VMware Tanzu in an offline (disconnected) environment, you should recreate and package the
dependencies, including the New Relic agent binaries, using offline buildpacks in your VMware Tanzu environment.

For more information, see [Packaging Dependencies for Offline Buildpacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/depend-pkg-offline.html).
