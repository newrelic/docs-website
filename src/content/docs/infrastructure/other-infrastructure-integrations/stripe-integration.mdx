To monitor your Stripe application, you'll instrument the application so it sends data to the New Relic Metric API. Then, you can view the data in a single, pre-built Stripe dashboard that tracks metrics like transaction overview, transaction volume, revenue, and transaction errors.

## Set up Stripe monitoring [#stripe-setup]

To set up Stripe monitoring, you'll create a call from your Stripe application to the New Relic Metrics API. The way you do this will vary, depending on the language and agent you're using. Here's an example of how to create this API call using JavaScript.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For more guidance about using this API, see the [Metric API documentation](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/report-metrics-metric-api/).
</Callout>

Before you get started, make sure you have a New Relic license key (See [New Relic API Keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/)).

On a successful Stripe payment, we receive a JSON from the Stripe API service. We need to send these values to New Relic by formatting the JSON according to the New Relic Metric API requirements.

The following JavaScript code snippet formats the data and sends it to the New Relic Metric API URL. 

```javascript
const sendDataToNewRelic = (sessionJSON) => {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const currentTime = currentDate.getTime();
  const nrMetrics = [{
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "stripe_metrics",
        "timestamp": currentTime,
        "value": 0,
        "attributes": {
          "stripe.session_id": sessionJSON.id,
          "stripe.amount_total": sessionJSON.amount_total,
          "stripe.customer_email": sessionJSON.customer_details.email,
          "stripe.created_at": sessionJSON.created,
          "stripe.currency" : sessionJSON.currency,
          "stripe.payment_status": sessionJSON.payment_status,
          "stripe.status": sessionJSON.status,
          "stripe.discount_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_discount,
          "stripe.shipping_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_shipping,
          "stripe.tax_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_tax
        }
      }
    ]
  }]

  const nrMetricAPI = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1'
  axios({
    url: nrMetricAPI,
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Api-Key': 'LICENSE_KEY'
      },
    data: JSON.stringify(nrMetrics)
  })
    .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response here if needed
    console.log('Metrics data sent successfully:', response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the request
    console.error('Error sending metrics data to New Relic:', error);
  })
}

```

Be sure to change the `sessionJSON` according to your response, and call this function where you are getting Stripe metrics in your application:

```javascript
  sendDataToNewRelic (session)
```
## View your Stripe metrics [#view-stripe-metrics] 

You can view metrics by querying them or by setting up a Stripe dashboard.

### View in query builder [#stripe-in-query-builder]

You can use NRQL to query metrics directly in query builder. If you need more information see [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder). 

For example, if you want to view net revenue obtained from Stripe, try this query in the query builder:

```sql
SELECT stripe.amount_total 
FROM Metric 
WHERE metricName = 'stripe_metrics'
```

### Install our Stripe monitoring dashboard [#add-dashboard]

To set up our pre-built Stripe dashboard to monitor your application metrics, go to the [Stripe dashboard installation](https://onenr.io/0BQrXaNgnRZ) and follow the instructions. Once installed, the dashboard should display metrics.

If you need help with dashboards, see:

* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
