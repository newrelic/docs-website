## Problem [#problem]

The agent is working but some of the metadata or inventory data appears incorrect, and the local caching is preventing correct data to be sent from the infrastructure agent.

## Solution [#solution]

Linux
Stop the Infrastructure Agent
```
systemctl stop newrelic-infra
```
Delete temporary files
```
rm -rf /var/db/newrelic-infra/data
```
Start the Infrastructure Agent
```
systemctl start newrelic-infra
```

Windows
In an Administrator PowerShell prompt, stop the Infrastructure Agent
```
net stop newrelic-infra
```
Delete temporary files
```
Remove-Item -Path “C:\ProgramData\New Relic\newrelic-infra\data” -Recurse -Force
```
Start the Infrastructure Agent
```
net start newrelic-infra
```

## Cause [#cause]

The agent caches metadata & inventory data locally, to determine what delta to send.
In some situations, it might be desired to reset this local cache / state, so that all data is sent accross.
