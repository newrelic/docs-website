## Problem

You installed the infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the [infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-ui-overview).

## Solution

Data should appear in the infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents.

<Callout variant="important">
  For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com) for assistance.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important">
  By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set [`enable_process_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#enable-process-metrics) to `true`. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure [`include_matching_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#include-matching-metrics).
</Callout>

### Missing infrastructure data [#missing-infra]

If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem:

1. Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="apt-install-verify"
       title="Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu)"
     >
       1. Use `dpkg` to verify that the agent is installed:

          ```
          dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra
          ```
       2. If `dpkg` returns no output, see [Install with apt](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-linux#apt-based).
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="yum-install-verify"
       title="Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL)"
     >
       1. Use `rpm` to verify that agent is installed:

          ```
          rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra
          ```
       2. If `rpm` returns no output, see [Install with yum](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-linux#yum-based).
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="windows-install-verify"
       title="Verify install for Windows Server"
     >
       1. Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the [agent directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory#infra-agent) exists:

          ```
          dir "C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra"
          ```
       2. If you receive a `File not found` error, see [Install for Windows Server](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server).
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
2. Use [your init system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status#init-system) to verify that the agent is running:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="systemd-verify-status"
       title="Verify status with SystemD"
     >
       Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher:

       1. Check that the agent is running:

          ```
          sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra
          ```
       2. If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually:

          ```
          sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="systemv-verify-status"
       title="Verify status with System V"
     >
       Use System V commands with Debian 7:

       1. Check that the agent is running:

          ```
          sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status
          ```
       2. If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually:

          ```
          sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="upstart-verify-status"
       title="Verify status with Upstart"
     >
       Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower:

       1. Check that the agent is running:

          ```
          sudo initctl status newrelic-infra
          ```
       2. If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually:

          ```
          sudo initctl start newrelic-infra
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="windows-verify-status"
       title="Verify status with Windows"
     >
       Use the Windows command prompt:

       1. Check that the agent is running:

          ```
          sc query "newrelic-infra" | find "RUNNING"
          ```

       2. If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt:

          ```
          net start newrelic-infra
          ```

          If running `net start newrelic-infra` returns `The service name is invalid`, the infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created.

          To test this:

       3. From Powershell, run the command `get-service newrelic-infra`, which will return the status of the service.

       4. If it returns an error `Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra`, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent.
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
3. Use [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) to try to automatically identify the issue.
4. Verify that your [`newrelic-infra.yml`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#config-file) configuration file contains a valid [`license_key`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#conf-license_key) setting.
5. Verify that the host has a [unique hostname](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#hostname), and verify that the hostname is not `localhost`. For more information, see this [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-a-common-reason-for-a-host-failing-to-show-up-in-the-infrastructure-dashboard/53031).
6. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the [Infrastructure domains and ports](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks#infrastructure).
7. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Query builder, like:

   ```
   SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100
   ```

   Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp.
8. [Generate verbose logs](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) and examine the logs for errors.

### Missing integration data [#missing-integrations]
