<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data), each with associated [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) that represent assorted metrics and metadata.

Understanding infrastructure data can help you:

* Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI.
* [Manage your infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/manage-infrastructure-data-reporting).
* Create better [host filter sets](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/filter-sets-organize-your-infrastructure-hosts).
* Run better [queries of your data](#query-data).
* Set up better monitoring solutions using [custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#attributes).

## Infrastructure events

The following are [events](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some [infrastructure integrations](/docs/intro-infrastructure-integrations).

The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also [create custom queries and charts](#query-data) of this data.

If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see [AWS data](#shared-attributes).

Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "220px" }}>
        Event
      </th>

      <th>

        [`SystemSample`](/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8407&event=SystemSample)
      </td>

      <td>
        `SystemSample` contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a `SystemSample` event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the [**Hosts** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-hosts-page-measure-resource-usage).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [`ProcessSample`](/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8407&event=ProcessSample)
      </td>

      <td>
        `ProcessSample` gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a `ProcessSample` event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the [**Processes** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-processes-page-inspect-process-performance).

        <Callout variant="important">
          Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. [Enable process metrics](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#enable-process-metrics) to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI.

        [`StorageSample`](/attribute-dictionary/?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8407&event=StorageSample)
      </td>

      <td>
        `StorageSample` represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a `StorageSample` event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the [**Storage** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-storage-page-evaluate-disk-usage-efficiency).

        <Callout variant="important">
          If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, `StorageSample` events will not be generated for those disks.

      <td>
        `NetworkSample` captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a `NetworkSample` event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the [**Network** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-network-page-measure-compare-capacity).

      <td>
        `ContainerSample` collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a `ContainerSample` event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the [**Containers** UI page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-hosts-page-measure-resource-usage). For more information, see [Docker monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure).

      </td>

      <td>
        `InfrastructureEvent` describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an `InfrastructureEvent` that logs that activity. This data appears on the [**Events** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the [documentation for a specific integration](/docs/integrations).

If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have [AWS attributes](#shared-attributes) attached.

## Query infrastructure data [#query-data]

You can [query your infrastructure data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to `ProcessSample`, you would run this NRQL query:

```
SELECT * FROM ProcessSample
```

You can also [query infrastructure using dimensional metrics](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql).

## Manage data

For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see [Manage infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/manage-infrastructure-data-reporting).

## Add custom attributes [#custom-attributes]

You can create [custom attributes](/docs/meatballs-configuring-your-agent#attributes) in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to:

* Create infrastructure [filter sets](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/organize-infrastructure-hosts-filter-sets)
* Populate the [**Group by**](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/group-infrastructure-results-specific-attributes) menu
* Annotate your infrastructure data

## Common Amazon EC2 attributes [#shared-attributes]

If you [connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/amazon-aws-ec2-integration-infrastructure), we report data from your [Amazon EC2 instances](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-ec2-integration). Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected.

These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose.
