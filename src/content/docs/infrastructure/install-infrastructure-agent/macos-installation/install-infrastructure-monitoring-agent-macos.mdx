With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent for macOS, you can monitor key performance metrics on macOS hosts. The agent can run on your own hardware or in cloud systems such as Amazon EC2.

The infrastructure monitoring agent [is compatible](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent) with all generally available, Apple supported macOS versions.

## Install for macOS [#install-macos]

Before installation, be sure to review the [requirements](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructurets). Then, to install the infrastructure monitoring agent for macOS, you can use our [Guided Install](/docs/full-stack-observability/observe-everything/get-started/new-relic-guided-install-overview/), or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic installation.

## Limitations [#limitations]

The following capabilities of the infrastructure agent are not yet available on macOS:

* [Log forwarder](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/).
* [On-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations/) (including built-in integrations such as Docker and Flex).
* Automated deployment via Configuration Management tools (Chef, Ansible, Puppet).

## Step-by-step instructions [#instructions]

To install the infrastructure monitoring agent, follow the step-by-step instructions:

<CollapserGroup>

    title="Homebrew install"
  >
    1. Review the [agent requirements and supported operating systems](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).

    2. Make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed in the system.
       You can check if Homebrew is installed with:

       ```
         which brew
       ```

       If it's not installed, you can install it with this command (or check [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) up-to-date instructions):

       ```
         /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
       ```

    3. Then, open the terminal and run the following command:

       ```
         brew install newrelic/tap/newrelic-infra-agent -q
       ```

    4. Start the infrastructure agent service:

       ```
         brew services start newrelic-infra-agent
       ```
    
    5. Create the configuration file and add your [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key/):

       ```
         echo "license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" | sudo tee -a /usr/local/etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml
       ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Wait a few minutes, then [view your server in the Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage). If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the [troubleshooting steps](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-infrastructure).

## What's next? [#configure]

The only required [configuration option](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent) is the [`license_key`](/docs/Infrastructure-configure-your-agent#conf-license_key) setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to:

* [Add custom attributes](/docs/Infrastructure-configure-your-agent#conf-custom_attributes) to annotate your infrastructure data.
* [Connect your AWS account](/docs/infrastructure-amazon-aws-ec2-integration#connect) if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2.
* Add other [New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) to collect data from external services.

## Update the agent [#update]

To upgrade to the latest version, follow standard procedures to [update the infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
