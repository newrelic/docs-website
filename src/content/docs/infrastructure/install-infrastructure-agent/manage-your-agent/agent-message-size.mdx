Since infrastructure agent [version 1.0.989](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes), the maximum message size is 1MB (10^6 bytes), and it can include events, metrics, and inventory integrations indistinctly. Previously, the maximum message size was 5MB, although inventory data was limited to 3MB.
