From agent version [1.24.0](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/releases/tag/1.24.0) you can enable agent instrumentation
and monitor the agent performance using New Relic [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/). This will allow you
to have a better vision of the agent's behaviour, queues utilization and integrations payloads among others making it easier
to configure and troubleshoot it.

<Callout variant="important">
Infrastructure Agent instrumentation is in alpha state and transactions, metrics... can change. We recommend to enable it only for
troubleshooting and not to create dashboards or alerts using its metrics.
</Callout>


Self instrumentation is disabled by default. To enable it use the configuration option [self_instrumentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#self-instrumentation):

```
self_instrumentation: "newrelic"
```

Once `self_instrumentation` is enabled, the agent will report metrics about itself and a new application `New Relic Infrastructure Agent`
will appear in NR1 APM and you will be able to monitor the agent's:

* Go Runtime (cpu, memory...)
* Transactions (samplers, integrations, https post...)
* Agent internal Event Queue size and utilization
* Integrations execution and payloads size
