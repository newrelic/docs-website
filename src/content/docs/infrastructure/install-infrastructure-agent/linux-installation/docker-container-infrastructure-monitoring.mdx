The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux [supports Docker environments](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure) by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host.

Using the [custom (recommended)](#custom-setup) or [basic setup](#simple-setup) allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version.

## What you need [#requirements]

The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the [Linux distributions and versions](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/compatibility-requirements-infrastructure-agent#operating-systems) supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. 

The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities.

## Custom setup (recommended) [#custom-setup]

The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host.

**Recommendation:** Extend the [`newrelic/infrastructure` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/infrastructure/), and use your own `newrelic-infra.yml` agent [config file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent). Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker.

### Docker CLI

1. Create the `newrelic-infra.yml` agent [config file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent) with your New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). For config option explanations, see [configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings).

   ```
   license_key: <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>
   ```
2. Create the `Dockerfile` extending the `newrelic/infrastructure` image, and add your config to `/etc/newrelic-infra.yml`:

   ```
   FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest
   ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
   ```
3. Build and tag your image:

   ```
   docker build -t <var>YOUR_IMAGE_NAME</var> .
   ```
4. Run the container from the image you built with the required [required run flags](#required-privileges):

   ```
   docker run \
       -d \
       --name newrelic-infra \
       --network=host \
       --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
       --privileged \
       --pid=host \
       -v "/:/host:ro" \
       -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" \
       <var>YOUR_IMAGE_NAME</var>
   ```
5. For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see [What's next?](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux#what-next)

### Docker Compose

1. Create a folder to store the configuration files:

   ```
   mkdir ~/newrelic-infra-setup
   ```
2. Change directory to the one you've just created:

   ```
   cd ~/newrelic-infra-setup
   ```
3. Create the `newrelic-infra.yml` agent [config file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent) with your New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). For config option explanations, see [configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings).

   ```
   echo "license_key: <var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>" > newrelic-infra.yml
   ```
4. Create the `newrelic-infra.dockerfile` extending the `newrelic/infrastructure` image, and add your config to `/etc/newrelic-infra.yml`:

   ```
   touch newrelic-infra.dockerfile
   ```

   ```
   vim newrelic-infra.dockerfile #you can use any text editor
   ```
5. Put the following content in the file:

   ```
   FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest
   ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml
   ```
6. Create `docker-compose.yaml`:

   ```
   touch docker-compose.yaml
   ```

   ```
   vim docker-compose.yaml #you can use any text editor
   ```

   Put following content in the file:

   ```
   version: '3'

   services:
     agent:
       container_name: newrelic-infra
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: newrelic-infra.dockerfile
       cap_add:
         - SYS_PTRACE
       network_mode: host
       pid: host
       privileged: true
       volumes:
         - "/:/host:ro"
         - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```
7. Build and start `docker-compose`:

   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
   ```

## Required container privileges [#required-privileges]

Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers.

The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about [infrastructure monitoring and security](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security). Required privileges include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "460px" }}>
        Privilege
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `--network=host`
      </td>

      <td>
        Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `-v "/:/host:ro"`
      </td>

      <td>
        Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`
      </td>

      <td>
        Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `--privileged`
      </td>

      <td/>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `--pid=host`
      </td>

      <td/>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `-v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"`
      </td>

      <td>
        Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Next steps after install [#next-steps]

For next steps after install is completed, see [What's next?](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux#what-next)

## Inventory collected [#inventory]

[Inventory](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure) is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Container data [#view]

Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same [host compute data](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage) and [event data](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change) that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to [view your Docker container data](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure#find-data).

## Containerized agent image [#view]

The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image.

Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by `latest` tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. 

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. You can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
