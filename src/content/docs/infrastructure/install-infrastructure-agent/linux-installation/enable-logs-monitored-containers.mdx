Our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring) can gather logs from your containers. When you enable logs from the infrastructure agent, the agent will automatically assign those logs to the hosts running Docker.

## Requirements [#requirements]

To collect logs from your containers, you need to have:

    * Infrastructure agent [1.8.32](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1832) or higher running on Linux
    * CentOS version 6.0 or higher, if you're using CentOS
    * Docker with engine from [v1.12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/prior-releases/#1120-2016-07-28) or other [`containerd`-based container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes)

## Collect logs from your containers [#collect-logs]

1. Open the configuration file for the infrastructure agent and add this snippet:

    ```yml
    - name: containers
      file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log
    ```

<img
    title="Add the containers path to your snippet"
    alt="A screenshot that shows where to add this snippet in context of your yaml file"
    src={infrastructureAddContainersLogPath}
/>

* You may find this file at this path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/logging.yml`.
* This section directs the agent to collect logs from your containers

2. Add a tag section to your Docker configuration that passes in the default `{{.Name}}` attribute:

* Docker run command example

    ```shell
    docker run --log-opt tag="{{.Name}}" -d log-generator
    ```

* Docker Compose example in `docker-compose.yml`

    ```yml
    version: '3.9'
    x-default-logging: &logging
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "5m"
        max-file: "2"
        tag: "{{.Name}}"
    ```

<img
    title="Configuration file in context"
    alt="Screenshot that shows this snippet in context of a configuration file"
    src={infrastructureAddNamesLogs}
/>

This adds a `attrs.tag` attribute to your logs, which looks like this snippet:

    ```json
        {
        agentName:Infrastructure
        agentVersion:1.50.0
        **attrs.tag:cart-service**
        coreCount:1
        ...
        }
    ```

3. Once the `attrs.tag` appears in your host-level logs, you can enable container logs by going to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure </DoNotTranslate>, then click <DoNotTranslate>**HERE**</DoNotTranslate>.

4. Create a log parsing rule by applying these configurations:

    * Name: container name
    * Field to parse: attrs.tag
    * Filter logs based on NRQL: attrs.tag is not null
    * Parsing rule: %{NOTSPACE:containerName}

Your modal should look like this:

    <img
        title="Log parsing rules"
        alt="Screenshot of log parsing in UI"
        src={logsParsingUi}
    />

5. Generate some data, wait a few minutes, and you'll see container logs assigned to your containers running on your host, rather than assigned to the host itself.
