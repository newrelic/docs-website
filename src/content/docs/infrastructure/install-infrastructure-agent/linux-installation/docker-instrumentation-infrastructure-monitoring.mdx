Our [infrastructure agent](/docs/welcome-new-relic-infrastructure) automatically monitors your Docker containers. With Docker monitoring you can:

* Group containers by [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor), [attributes](#docker-data), and other metadata.
* Search for containers relevant to your monitoring scenario.
* Link to related entities that may be affected by issues with the container.
* Set [Docker-related alert conditions](#alerts).

## Requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  To use infrastructure monitoring with Docker containers, as well as the rest of our [observability platform](https://one.newrelic.com), join the New Relic family! [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever.
</Callout>

Requirement details for automatic Docker container monitoring for New Relic's infrastructure agent:

* Infrastructure agent [1.8.32](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-1832) or higher running on Linux
* If using CentOS, you must have CentOS version 6.0 or higher
* Docker [version 1.12](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-1-12-built-in-orchestration/) or higher

## Enable Docker container monitoring [#enable]

If you meet the [requirements](#requirements) and have installed the correct infrastructure monitoring agent, there are no additional steps to enable Docker monitoring. If Docker is running, data will automatically be reported.

You can also use a Docker image containing the infrastructure monitoring agent. For more information, see [Docker container for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-container-infrastructure-monitoring).

## View your Docker data [#find-data]

To view your Docker data in the New Relic UI, use either of these options:

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> Hosts > Containers**.

  OR
* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> Third-party services**, and select Docker-related links.

For more information, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

## Docker attributes [#docker-data]

Docker attributes (metrics and metadata) are attached to the [`ContainerSample`](/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B0%5D=10181) event. Here's an example of a query to find out how many containers are associated with each Docker image:

```
SELECT uniqueCount(containerId) FROM ContainerSample FACET imageName SINCE 1 HOUR AGO TIMESERIES
```

To see all `ContainerSample` attributes, use our [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B0%5D=10181). Attributes include:

* General metadata (like `containerId`, `name`, and `image`)
* CPU metrics (like `cpuUsedCores`, `cpuPercent`, and `cpuThrottleTimeMs`)
* Memory metrics (like `memoryUsageBytes`, `memoryCacheBytes`, and `memoryResidentSizeBytes`)
* Network metrics (like `networkRxBytes`, `networkRxDropped`, and `networkTxBytes`)

Docker metrics are also attached to the [`ProcessSample`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8412) event.

The reported data does **not** include information related to the container orchestrator (for example, ECS or Kubernetes). To monitor those, you can add the orchestrator's cluster and task names as [labels](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/admin/configure/add-labels-to-cluster-nodes/).

## Set alert conditions [#alerts]

To create Docker-related alert conditions, use either of these options:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI**.

   OR

   Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts**.
2. Create a new [alert condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions).
3. For the condition type, select **Container metrics**.
