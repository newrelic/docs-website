You can use New Relic's Ansible role to help you scale your New Relic Observability efforts using the [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) and [New Relic Open Installation repository](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library). For instructions on how to use Ansible, see the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/). This is a [community-supported](https://github.com/newrelic/ansible-install) effort.

<Callout variant="important">
  This role will always install the latest released version of the New Relic agent and doesn't support installing older versions.
</Callout>

## Sample code [#role-description]

New Relic provides configuration management sample code to help you install our infrastructure agent using workflows and tools that are common with many Ops teams. This is a basic Ansible role and is intended to be used as a starting place for creating your own customized workflow.

Configuration depends on your specific setup and standards. To view an Ansible sample role and more integration information, see the [Ansible Galaxy documentation](https://galaxy.ansible.com/newrelic/newrelic_install).

## Compatibility and requirements [#role-compatibility]

The Ansible role with New Relic's infrastructure agent requires a [supported operating system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).

If you need help with Ansible for Windows OS, take a look at [Setting up a Windows Host](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_setup.html), from the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/) site.

This role is tested with the Ansible Core 2.13 and 2.14 and Python 3.10. Ansible Core versions before 2.10 are not supported.

## Set up New Relic with Ansible [#role-setup]

### Installation

#### Ansible Galaxy

[Link to Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/newrelic/newrelic_install)

```shell
ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_install
```

Make sure you have `ansible.windows` and `ansible.utils` if they are not already installed:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows ansible.utils
```

#### Manual

If you want to use a local copy of the role, clone the repo and run `make` in the project root to copy this repo to `~/.ansible/roles/newrelic.newrelic_install`, enabling the role to behave as though it were installed from Galaxy.

### Getting started

To get started using the role `newrelic.newrelic_install`:

1. Include the role in your playbook.
2. Customize the required variables.

After installing, include the `newrelic.newrelic_install` role in a new or existing playbook. Here is an example of configuring your role to install the infrastructure agent:

```yml
---
- name: Install New Relic
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: newrelic.newrelic_install
      vars:
        targets:
          - infrastructure
          - logs
        tags:
          foo: bar
  environment:
    NEW_RELIC_API_KEY: <API key>
    NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: <Account ID>
    NEW_RELIC_REGION: <Region>
