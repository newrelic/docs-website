You can use New Relic's Ansible role to install and configure our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-infrastructure). For instructions on how to use Ansible, see the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/). This is a community-supported effort.

Want to configure the infrastructure agent using Ansible? [Create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) for free! No credit card required.

## Sample code [#role-description]

New Relic provides configuration management sample code to help you install our infrastructure monitoring agent using workflows and tools that are common with many Ops teams. This is a basic Ansible role and is intended to be used as a starting place for creating your own customized workflow.

Configuration depends on your specific setup and standards. To view an Ansible sample role and more integration information, see the [Ansible Galaxy documentation](https://galaxy.ansible.com/newrelic/newrelic-infra/).

## Compatibility and requirements [#role-compatibility]

The Ansible role with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent requires a [supported Linux operating system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).

## Set up New Relic with Ansible [#role-setup]

The `newrelic.newrelic-infra` role:

* Adds the New Relic infrastructure agent package repository source.
* Installs and configures the infrastructure agent.

To get started using this role:

1. Include the role in your playbook.
2. Customize the required variables.

All typical interactions with `newrelic.newrelic-infra` use role configuration. Here is an example of configuring your role to install the infrastructure agent:

```
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - role: newrelic.newrelic-infra
      vars:
        nrinfragent_config:
          license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

## Role configuration variables [#role-config]
