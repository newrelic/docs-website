Read on to learn how to use New Relic's Ansible role to install and configure [New Relic's infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-infrastructure). For instructions on how to use Ansible, see the [Ansible documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/). This is a community-supported effort.

## Description [#role-description]

New Relic provides configuration management sample code to help you install the New Relic infrastructure agent using workflows and tools that are common with many Ops teams. To view an Ansible sample role and more integration information, see the [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/newrelic/newrelic-infra/).

<Callout variant="important">
  This is a basic Ansible role and is intended to be used as a starting place for creating your own customized workflow. Configuration depends on your specific setup and standards.
</Callout>

## Compatibility and requirements [#role-compatibility]

The Ansible role with New Relic's infrastructure agent requires a [supported Linux operating system](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).

## Setup [#role-setup]

The `newrelic.newrelic-infra` role:

* Adds the New Relic infrastructure agent package repository source.
* Installs and configures the infrastructure agent.

To get started using this role:

1. Include the role in your playbook.
2. Customize the required variables.

## Use and install [#usage]

All typical interactions with `newrelic.newrelic-infra` use role configuration. Here is an example of configuring your role to install the infrastructure agent:

```
- hosts: ap_northeast_1
  roles:
    - name: newrelic.newrelic-infra
      vars:
        nrinfragent_os_name: YOUR_OS_NAME
        nrinfragent_os_version: YOUR_OS_VERSION
        nrinfragent_config:
          license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
          log_file: /var/log/newrelic/nr-infra.log
          log_to_stdout: false
```

## Role configuration variables [#role-config]

Here are available variables for configuring the `newrelic.newrelic-infra` role:
