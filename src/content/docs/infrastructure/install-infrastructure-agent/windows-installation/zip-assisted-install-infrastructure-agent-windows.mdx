With the assisted install of the infrastructure agent for Windows, you can make the changes you need to the installation script we provide so you can adapt it to your environment. Before installation, make sure to check the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).

## Install the agent [#install]

<Callout variant="important">
  As of [version 1.4.0](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-140), the infrastructure agent package includes the additional `newrelic-infra-ctl` binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. [See our docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/manage-your-agent/troubleshoot-running-agent) for more information.
</Callout>

To install the agent:

1. Download the [packaged agent file](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/windows/).
2. Unpack the file.
3. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure:

   ![Infra-windows-files.png](./images/Infra-windows-files.png "Infra-windows-files.png")
4. Once it's unpacked, access and edit the installation PowerShell script `installer.ps1`.
5. Update your license key.
6. Optional: Update any other [parameters](#parameters).
7. Execute `installer.ps1` with admin rights.

## Configure your installation [#parameters]

<Callout variant="important">
  Make sure any custom folder defined in the installation settings has permissions limitations properly defined. The infrastructure agent might execute any integration defined in the `NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR` directory with Administrator permissions.
</Callout>

You can configure the following parameters during the assisted install for Windows:

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NRIA_OVERWRITE`
      </td>

      <td>
        By default and for security reasons, Windows does not install a service if there's another service with the same name already installed. To bypass this check, make sure this setting `NRIA_OVERWRITE` is `TRUE`.

        ```
        TRUE
