Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem.

This method gives you **full control** of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions.

Before installation, check the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent).

## Install the agent [#windows-manual-install]

To install the agent:

1. Download the [packaged agent file](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/windows/) or use the following command that automatically fetches a specific version of the agent, its checksum and verifies it after download. Replace `$arch=amd64` with desired architecture (amd64, 386) and `$v=1.27.4` with [latest or specific version](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/releases/latest).

   ```
   $v="1.27.4"; $arch="amd64"; $url="https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/binaries/windows/$arch/newrelic-infra-$arch.$v.zip";@("$url", "$url.sum") | ForEach-Object { Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $_ -OutFile $_.Split('/')[-1] }; write-host 'Checksum:' $(If (Select-String -Path "$url.sum".Split('/')[-1] -Pattern (Get-FileHash $url.Split('/')[-1]).Hash -Quiet) {"Ok"} Else {"Fail"})
   ```
2. Unpack the file.
3. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure:

   <img
     title="Infra-windows-files.png"
     alt="Infra-windows-files.png"
     src={infrastructureInfraAgentWindowsFolderStructure}
   />
4. [Install the service script](#install-service-script).

**Optionally**, you can:

* [Change the location of the configuration file](#change-config-file).
* [Configure the plugin directory](#configure-plugin).
* [Configure the agent directory](#agent-directory).
* [Configure the log file](#log-file).

## Install the service script [#install-service-script]

To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference:

```
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\installer.ps1
```

## Configuration file [#change-config-file]

The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named `newrelic-infra.yml`, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent.

You can create a new config file based on the [config file template](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-config-file-template-newrelic-infrayml). For more information, see how to [configure the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent).

### Changing the config file's location

By default, the configuration file is located in `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.yml`.

To change the location of the configuration file:

1. Execute the command `regedit.exe`.
2. Browse to the folder `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\newrelic-infra\ImagePath`.
3. Retrieve the `ImagePath` key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.exe`.
4. Use the `-config` flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\config.yaml
   ```

## Configure the plugin directory [#configure-plugin]

The infrastructure agent allows you to install [integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations) that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named `integration-name-config.yml` by default.

This config file is placed in the predefined location `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d`. On initialization, the agent loads the config file.

To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods:

* Set the location in the `NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR` environment variable.
* Set the custom path in the `newrelic-infra.yml` configuration file using the `plugin_dir` field.
* Pass it as a command line argument using `-plugin_dir` when you run the `newrelic-infra` binary.

## Configure the agent directory [#agent-directory]

The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed [integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations), caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\`.

The agent directory has the following structure and content:

* `LICENSE`: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license.
* `custom-integrations`: Directory that stores the installed the [custom integrations](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations-sdk).
* `newrelic-integrations`: Directory that stores the [New Relic official integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations).

The agent also uses a different folder, `app_data_dir`, to store data. By default it points to `C:\ProgramData\New Relic\newrelic-infra\`.

To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods:

* Set the location in the `NRIA_AGENT_DIR` environment variable.
* Set the custom path in the `newrelic-infra.yml` configuration file using the `agent_dir` field.
* Pass it as a command line argument using `-agent_dir` when you run the `newrelic-infra` binary.

## Configure the log file [#log-file]

By default the agent stores the log files in `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.log`.

To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods:

* Set the location in the `NRIA_LOG_FILE` environment variable.
* Set the custom path in the `newrelic-infra.yml` configuration file using the `log_file` field.
* Pass it as a command line argument using `-log_file` when you run the `newrelic-infra` binary.

## What's next? [#what-next]

You may also want to:

* [Add custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#custom-attributes) to annotate your infrastructure data.
* [Connect your AWS account](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/) if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2.
* Add other [New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/) to collect data from external services.
* Manually [start, stop, restart, or check the agent status](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/#windows).
