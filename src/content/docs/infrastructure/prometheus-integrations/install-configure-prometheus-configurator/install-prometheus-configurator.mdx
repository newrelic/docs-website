## Install in Kubernetes [#kubernetes]

You can find the documentation of how to install Kubernetes integration (which includes the feature flag for Prometheus Configurator) here: [Kubernetes integration: install and configure](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure)

Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for [deploying our integration using Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm).

By default, the New Relic Prometheus Configurator uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the [metrics filtering](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-configurator/filter-prometheus-metrics) documentation. If you need advanced configuration for you targets head to [set up prometheus agent configurator](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-configurator/set-up-prometheus-agent-configurator.mdx).

Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

```
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = '<var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME</var>' since 1 hour ago
```
