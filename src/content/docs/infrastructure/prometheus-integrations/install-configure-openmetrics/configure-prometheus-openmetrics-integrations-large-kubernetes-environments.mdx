CPU and memory limits and requests can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration which scrapes `800` targets, exposing `1000 timeseries` each, with a latency of `150ms` and a `scrape_duration` of 30 seconds, consumes `2.5CPU` and `700MB` of RAM.

## Configure the integration for large environments [#configuration]

To estimate the size of the environment you are monitoring, run the following query to see how many targets are being scraped:

```
SELECT latest(nr_stats_targets) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clusterName’ SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES
```

In huge environments with hundreds of targets to be scraped, the latency on the `/metrics` endpoints must be below 1 second. Run this query to check the latency of the different targets. This query retrieves the data exposed by the [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration), and shows the time required to fetch each endpoint.

```
SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30
```

In order to keep the time needed to scrape all the targets below 30 seconds, use the following configurations:

<table style={{ width: "700px" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Targets
      </th>

      <th>
        Configuration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Targets &lt; 400, with 1000 metrics each
      </td>

      <td>
        No modification is required. CPU ranges roughly between `0.1` and `1.5` cores, and the memory required should be no more than `256MB`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        400 &lt; targets &lt; 1000, with 1000 metrics each
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of workers should be increased to `6-8`. CPU ranges roughly between `1.5` and `3.5` cores, and the memory required is around `100MB`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Targets > 1000, with 1000 metrics each
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of workers should be increased to 10 or more. CPU is over `3.5` cores, and the memory required is around `1GB` or more.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
