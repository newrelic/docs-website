Before you install New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, [review the requirements](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/monitor-prometheus-new-relic#OpenMetrics-Compatibility).

## Install in Kubernetes [#kubernetes]

We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments which also covers the configuration of the monitorization of Kubernetes clusters.

You can find the documentation of how to install Kubernetes integration (which includes the feature flag for Prometheus OpenMetric's integration) here: [Kubernetes integration: install and configure](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure)

Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for [deploying our integration using Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm).

By default, the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the [metrics filtering](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/configure/filter-prometheus-metrics) documentation.

Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

```
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = '<var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME</var>' since 1 hour ago
```

## Docker [#docker]

### Install [#docker-install]

To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Docker environment:

1. Create a configuration file `config.yaml`. Use the [example configuration file](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integration#example-configuration-file), or look at the [`nri-prometheus-latest.yaml`](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml) manifest file, which includes the `nri-prometheus-cfg` config map and an example configuration.

* **Required:** Add your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) and a cluster name to identify your Docker container.
* Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the `http://localhost:8080/metrics` endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself.
* Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the [metrics filtering](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/configure/filter-prometheus-metrics) documentation.

2. Start the integration in the background:

   ```
   docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
       --name nri-prometheus \
       -e LICENSE_KEY="<var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>" \
       -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
       newrelic/nri-prometheus:1.5
   ```

3. Confirm the container is running properly:

   ```
   docker ps -f "name=nri-prometheus"
   ```

4. Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

   ```
   FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = '<var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME</var>' since 1 hour ago
   ```

 ## Linux [#linux]

 ### Install [#linux-install]

To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration on a Linux operating system:

1. Install the [infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager)

2. Once the infrastructure agent is successfully installed, navigate to `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin`. You should see 'nri-prometheus' file present in it.

* If you did not find the nri-prometheus file in the above mentioned path, kindly follow the below manual installation process.

* **Manual Installation of nri-prometheus:**

* Below are the two types of manual installation processes. You can choose any one type of installation.

    title="Install nri-prometheus using github source"
  >
    1. Download the latest release of file name ending with (tar.gz) from [newrelic's nri-prometheus github repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/releases).
    2. Extract the downloaded file
    3. Open the extracted directory and navigate to the below path to find 'nri-prometheus' file.
    ```
    cd /<extracted_directory>/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin
    ```
    4. Copy the above nri-prometheus file to `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin` directory
    5. Installation of nri-prometheus is completed.

  <Collapser
    id="OpenMetrics-Linux-install-host-integration"
    title="Install nri-prometheus using host integration"
  >
    Follow the instructions for [installing the infrastructure on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations/) using the `INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME = nri-prometheus`.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

3. Configuring nri-prometheus
* Create a configuration file named 'nri-prometheus-config.yml' in path `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`.
```
touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
```
* Make sure your configuration file is matching the [nri-prometheus configuration file template](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample)
* Update your prometheus formatted metric URLs in the `targets > urls` section of the configuration file. So that New Relic infrastructure agent can send those metrics to one.newrelic.com.

4. [Restart the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/)

5. Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:
```
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago
```

### Update the integration [#docker-update]

To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker or Kubernetes as applicable:

1. Remove the Docker container.
2. Follow [standard installation procedures](#docker-install) to start a new Docker container.

The integration logs its current version when it starts up. To determine the running version:

```
docker logs nri-prometheus 2>&1 | grep "Integration version"
```

Example output:

```
time="2019-02-26T09:21:21Z" level=info msg="Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version <var>1.0.0</var>"
```

### Uninstall [#docker-uninstall]

To uninstall the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, execute the following command:

```
docker rm -f nri-prometheus
```
