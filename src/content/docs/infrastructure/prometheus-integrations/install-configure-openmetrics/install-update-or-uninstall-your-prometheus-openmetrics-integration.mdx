## Docker [#docker]

### Install [#docker-install]

To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Docker environment:

1. Create a configuration file `config.yaml`. Use the [example configuration file](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integration#example-configuration-file), or look at the [`nri-prometheus-latest.yaml`](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml) manifest file, which includes the `nri-prometheus-cfg` config map and an example configuration.

* **Required:** Add your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and a cluster name to identify your Docker container.
* Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the `http://localhost:8080/metrics` endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself.
* Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the [metrics filtering](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent/#drop-keep-metrics) documentation.

2. Start the integration in the background:

   ```
   docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
       --name nri-prometheus \
       -e LICENSE_KEY="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" \
       -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
       newrelic/nri-prometheus:2.18.0
   ```

3. Confirm the container is running properly:

   ```
   docker ps -f "name=nri-prometheus"
   ```

4. Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

   ```
   FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago
   ```

### Update the integration [#docker-update]

To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker as applicable:

1. Remove the Docker container.
2. Follow [standard installation procedures](#docker-install) to start a new Docker container.

The integration logs its current version when it starts up. To determine the running version:

```
docker logs nri-prometheus 2>&1 | grep "Integration version"
```

Example output:

```
time="2019-02-26T09:21:21Z" level=info msg="Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version 1.0.0"
```

### Uninstall [#docker-uninstall]

To uninstall the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, execute the following command:

```
docker rm -f nri-prometheus
```
