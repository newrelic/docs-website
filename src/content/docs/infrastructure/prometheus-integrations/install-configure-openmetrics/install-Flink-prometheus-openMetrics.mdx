With our Apache Flink dashboards, you can easily track your Flink logs, keep an eye on your instrumentation sources, and get an overview of uptime and downtime for all your applications' instances. Built with our infrastructure agent and our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, Flink dashboards take advantage of OpenMetrics endpoint scraping, so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up Flink with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install and Configure Prometheus OpenMetrics

Before getting Flink data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing Prometheus OpenMetrics. 

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=a33ce5fc-d32b-e0b8-3941-30f13e4bc00b) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. Or if you prefer, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Install our [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration).

After you've installed Prometheus OpenMetrics, then you need to configure the `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file. Add the following snippet anywhere to the file:

```yml
integrations:
- name: nri-prometheus
    config:
    standalone: false
    # Defaults to true. When standalone is set to `false`, `nri-prometheus` requires an infrastructure agent to send data.
    emitters: infra-sdk
    # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
    cluster_name: <var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE</var>
    # Match the name of your cluster with the name seen in New Relic. 
    targets:
        - description: <var>YOUR_DESCRIPTION_HERE</var>
            urls: ["https://192.168.3.1:2379", "https://192.168.3.2:2379", "https://192.168.3.3:2379"]
            tls_config:
                ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
                cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
                key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"
    verbose: false
    # Defaults to false. This determines whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode.
    audit: false
    # Defaults to false and does not include verbose mode. Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic and can lead to a high log volume.
    scrape_timeout: <var>YOUR_TIMEOUT_DURATION</var>
    # Defaults to 30s. The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints.
    scrape_duration: "5s"
    worker_threads: 4
    # Defaults to `4` For clusters with more than 400 endpoints, slowly increase the worker thread until scrape time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.Increasing this value too much results in huge memory consumption if too many metrics are scraped at once.
    insecure_skip_verify: false
    # Defaults to false. Determins if the integration should skip TLS verification or not.
timeout: 10s
```

## Get Flink metrics as dashboards

After you've installed, integrated, and configured New Relic with Prometheus OpenMetrics, you can install the [ApacheFlink quickstart](). To find your dashboard in New Relic: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards > (select Apache Flink)**.
