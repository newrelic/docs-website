[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/) is a Kubernetes controller, responsible for continuously monitoring all running applications and comparing their live state to the desired state specified in the Git repository.

Use New Relic to view a dashboard based on Prometheus metrics to better understand the Argo CD infrastructure of your k8s cluster. With New Relic you can monitor:

* Application health status
* Application sync status
* Argo CD Controller stats
* Argo CD Server stats
* Repository stats

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

1. Follow the [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/) to learn more about the metrics exposed by Argo CD.

2. Set up Prometheus monitoring. Prometheus metrics need to be integrated with New Relic. You can use the Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes or the Prometheus Remote Write integration. See [how to send Prometheus metrics](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/) for more details.

  <Callout variant="important">
  The [Prometheus Agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#scrape-metrics-only-from-prometheus-integrations-scrape-prometheus-integrations) only scrapes metrics by default from a [set of integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/integrations-list-intro).

  In this case, you must identify your pod or endpoint with one of the these labels `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.newrelic.io/name`, `k8s-app` containing the string `argocd`.
  </Callout>

3. Use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

    ```sql
    FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
    ```

4. Install the [Argo CD quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/argocd-quickstart) to access built-in <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).

  Once you imported, you can edit or clone the assets to adapt them to your specific requirements.

  <Callout variant="important">
  Some charts of the dashboard include queries with conditions that require the identification of your pod or endpoint with one of the these labels `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.newrelic.io/name`, `k8s-app` containing the string `argocd`.
  </Callout>


## Find and use metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Data points per minute:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT rate(datapointcount(), 1 minute) WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' SINCE 1 day ago
  ```

## Troubleshooting

* Use this command to verify that the Argo CD Prometheus endpoint is emitting metrics on any K8s node configured with Argo CD:

  ```
  curl <Argo CD-Pod-IP>:8082/metrics
  ```

* You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/troubleshooting-guide/) for Prometheus integrations.
