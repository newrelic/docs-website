[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open source, in-memory data store used by developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.

New Relic provides crucial tools for monitoring your Redis instances using the [Prometheus Remote-Write](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/) integration. It supports features such as a visual dashboard complete with charts detailing all critical performance and health metrics relevant to your Redis system.

With New Relic you can monitor:

* Controller, repo server, and argo server statistics
* Overview snapshot (#masters, #slaves) + charts with commands/sec, and commands/sec by node
* Charts showing connected clients, connected clients by node, changes since last save by node, expired keys/second by node, memory used by node, and blocked clients
* Charts showing keyspace hit ratio by node, evicted keys/second by node, input bytes/second by node, network I/O per second, and output bytes / second by node

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

1. Follow the [Redis exporter documentation](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-redis-exporter) to add the required pod annotations for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

2. Set up Prometheus monitoring. Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

  <Callout variant="important">
  The [Prometheus Agent](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#scrape-metrics-only-from-prometheus-integrations-scrape-prometheus-integrations) only scrapes metrics by default from a [set of integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/integrations-list-intro).

  In this case, you must identify your pod or endpoint with one of the these labels `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.newrelic.io/name`, `k8s-app` containing the string `redis`.
  </Callout>

3. Use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

  ```sql
    FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE metricName LIKE 'redis_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
  ```

4. Install the [Redis (Prometheus) quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/redis-prometheus) to access built-in <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).

  Once you imported, you can edit or clone the assets to adapt them to your specific requirements.

  <Callout variant="important">
  Some charts of the dashboard include queries with conditions that require the identification of your pod or endpoint with one of the these labels `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.newrelic.io/name`, `k8s-app` containing the string `redis`.
  </Callout>

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [Redis exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter/blob/master/README.md#whats-exported).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE 'redis_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount() WHERE metricName LIKE 'redis_%' FACET metricName
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE metricName LIKE 'redis_%' SINCE 1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

This integration enables `Redis` entities powering the full set of [entity capabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) such as golden metrics, entity dashboards, workloads, and lookout.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [Redis exporter documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
