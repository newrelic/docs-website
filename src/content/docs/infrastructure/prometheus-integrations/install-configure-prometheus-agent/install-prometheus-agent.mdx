## Install in Kubernetes [#kubernetes]

See how to [install the Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure), which includes the feature flag for Prometheus Configurator.

Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for [deploying our integration using Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm).

By default, the New Relic Prometheus Configurator uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the [metrics filtering](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/filter-prometheus-metrics) documentation. If you need advanced configuration for you targets, head to [set up prometheus agent configurator](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-configurator/set-up-prometheus-agent-configurator).

To ensure the integration has been configured correctly, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > Query builder, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago
```

  If you don't see your data right away, wait for a few seconds. Data may take some time to make it to New Relic.
