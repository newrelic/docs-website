New Relic's Prometheus agent is a thin wrapper on top of Prometheus server to run it in agent mode. With this integration, you can create a YAML configuration file used by Prometheus that's ready to send metrics to New Relic.

Learn more about the solution from [its repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator).

## Install the Prometheus agent [#install-agent]

You can install the Prometheus agent either as part of the Kubernetes integration or on its own.

### Alongside the Kubernetes integration [#kubernetes-install]

You can install our [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration) to get a full observability of your Kubernetes clusters, which includes the Prometheus agent.

1. Install our Kubernetes integration. See how to install it [here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Alternatively, we also offer manual instructions for [deploying our integration using Helm](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm).
  
  You need to enable the Prometheus agent by setting the `newrelic-prometheus-agent.enabled=true` option.
</Callout>

2. To ensure the integration has been configured correctly, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Query your data**, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE collector.name = 'prometheus-agent' AND cluster_name = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago
  ```

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you don't see your data right away, wait for a few seconds. Data may take some time to make it to New Relic.
</Callout>

### Standalone installation [#prometheus-install]

If you don't need the Kubernetes integration, you can install the Prometheus agent on its own.

1. Install the [Prometheus Agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator#readme) by running:
  ```shell
  helm repo add newrelic-prometheus https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-prometheus-configurator
  helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic-prometheus/newrelic-prometheus-agent -f YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUES.yaml
  ```

2. To ensure the integration has been configured correctly, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Query your data**, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported:

  ```sql
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE collector.name = 'prometheus-agent' since 1 hour ago
  ```

## Install the Prometheus agent dashboard [#io-dashboard]

Regardless of whether you installed the Kubernetes integration or only the Prometheus agent, we also give you a curated dashboard for self-metrics with performance and health information, and also metrics volume sent.

With this dashboard, you get meaningful insights about your Prometheus metrics and your Prometheus agent, such as:

* Samples sent by Source
* Unique metrics by Source
* Timeseries by Source
* Timeseries by Metric (Cardinality)
* Memory and CPU consumption
* Targets Failed to scrape
* Total Instances by cluster

1. Install the [dashboard for the Prometheus agent](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/prometheus-agent) in your New Relic account.
