## Get verbose logs [#verbose-logs]

You can enable verbose logs in the `newrelic-prometheus-agent` chart by setting the `verboseLog` or `global.verboseLog` variables to `true`.

```yaml
# (...)
global:
  verboseLog: true
# (...)
```

Once this has been updated on the values files, run the following helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> newrelic-prometheus-configurator/newrelic-prometheus-agent \
--namespace <NEWRELIC_NAMESPACE> \
-f values-newrelic.yaml \
[--version fixed-chart-version]
```

## Not seeing metrics for a target [#target-with-no-metrics]

You need, at least, one `job` that is discovering the target in Kubernetes that matches the filter specified, or the target should be listed as `static_target`.

If you're using the default configuration on Kubernetes, check that your pod or service has the `prometheus.io/scrape=true` annotation.

By default, the Prometheus agent scrapes metrics only from [Prometheus integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/integrations-list-intro). Unless you selected to scrape all the Prometheus endpoints in the cluster, the Prometheus agent filters the endpoints to be scraped by using the labels defined in [source_labels](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml).


## Not seeing metrics in a dashboard [#dashboard-with-no-metrics]

Some of the <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> provided by the [Prometheus integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/integrations-list-intro) may have been filtered by a Kubernetes label. Check the corresponding integration documentation to get more information.

## Check up metric status [#up-metrics]

Every target scrape generates the `up` metric with the all target metrics. If scraping is successful, these metrics have `1` as a value. If it's not successful, their value is `0`.

```SQL
FROM Metric SELECT latest(up) WHERE cluster_name= 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' AND pod = 'TARGET_POD_NAME' TIMESERIES
```

If this metric doesn't exist for the target, it may have been dropped.

If the values are `0`, scraping has failed.

## Target dropped by filter rules [#target-dropped-by-filter]

To check dropped targets, you can use the Prometheus API's [targets endpoint](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).

To list all dropped targets in JSON format and show all discovered labels, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl exec newrelic-prometheus-agent-0 -- wget -O - 'localhost:9090/api/v1/targets?state=dropped' 2>/dev/null
```

## Target scrape fail [#target-scrape-fail]

If the `up` metrics have `0` as a value, it means that the target is actively scraped by Prometheus but the scrape has failed. You can check the reason in the verbose logs with a log entry similar to this:

```bash
prometheus ts=timestamp caller=scrape.go:1332 level=debug component="scrape manager" scrape_pool=kubernetes-job-pod target=http://1.2.3.4:80/metrics msg="<error>" err="<error detail>"
```

You can also check the active target list using Prometheus API's [targets endpoint](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#targets).

To list all active targets in JSON and show all discovered labels, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl exec newrelic-prometheus-agent-0 -- wget -O - 'localhost:9090/api/v1/targets?state=active' 2>/dev/null
```

The failed target will be listed, and the error will be available in the `lastError` field in an output similar to this:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "activeTargets": [
            {
                "discoveredLabels": <map of labels>,
                "labels": <map of labels>,
                "scrapePool": "kubernetes-job-pod",
                "scrapeUrl": "http://172.17.0.5:80/metrics",
                "globalUrl": "http://172.17.0.5:80/metrics",
                "lastError": <error detail>,
                "lastScrape": "2022-09-19T14:19:20.543747971Z",
                "lastScrapeDuration": 0.000372542,
                "health": "down",
                "scrapeInterval": "15s",
                "scrapeTimeout": "10s"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```
