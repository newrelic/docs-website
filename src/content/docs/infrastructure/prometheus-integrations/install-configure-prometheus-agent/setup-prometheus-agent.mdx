## Configure the Prometheus Agent [#configure-prometheus-agent]

You need to place the examples below in the `config` section of the agent. Refer to the [installation method](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent) you used to known which is in your case.

To configure the agent using Helm, you should set up your `values.yaml` in one of these two ways:

<Callout variant="tip">
  You need to add your New Relic <LicenseKey/> in the `values.yaml` file.
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="nri-bundle"
    title="Installed using our Helm bundle"
  >
    ```yaml
    global:
      licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
      cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

    newrelic-prometheus-agent:
      enabled: true
      config:
        # YOUR CONFIGURATION GOES HERE
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="standalone-helm-release"
    title="Standalone Helm release"
  >
    This option is only recommended if you're an advanced user.

    ```yaml
    licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
    cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

    config:
      # YOUR CONFIGURATION GOES HERE. An example:
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


## Define which endpoints to scrape [#endpoints-scrape]

By default, the New Relic Prometheus agent uses two annotations to discover targets: `newrelic.io/scrape: "true"` and `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`.

All the targets in the cluster that are annotated with `newrelic.io/scrape: "true"` are discovered and scraped by default.
The targets annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` will be scraped or not depending on the configuration.

### Scrape metrics only from Prometheus integrations [#scrape-prometheus-integrations]

The Prometheus agent can be configured to scrape metrics from the most popular integrations in Kubernetes. Have a look at the [list of integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/integrations-list/integrations-list-intro) containing a set of dashboards and alerts to start monitoring out of the box.

That list is defined in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml) of New Relic's Prometheus agent helm chart. You can modify this list, but some dashboards might not work out of the box with custom labels or values.

When upgrading, new integration filters might be available. Therefore, the amount of data scraped could increase, depending on the services in your cluster, after an upgrade involving integration filters. You can avoid this by saving a fixed list of `app_values` in your `values.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml
app_values: ["redis", "traefik", "calico", "nginx", "coredns", "kube-dns", "etcd", "cockroachdb"]
```

Moreover, it might happen that a new version of the integrations filters may cause a target that was already scraped by one job to be scraped a second time. 
In order to receive a notification in the event of duplicated data (and prevent duplicate scraping altogether), you can create an alert based on the following query:
```
FROM Metric select uniqueCount(job) facet instance, cluster_name limit 10 since 2 minutes ago
```
If any value is different from 1 then you have two or more jobs scraping the same instance in the same cluster.

### Scrape metrics from all the targets [#scrape-all-targets]

If you need to scrape all the targets annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, you need to perform one of the following actions, depending on the installation method you chose:

- If you used the guided install, unselect the **Scrape only metrics from Prometheus integrations** option.
  <img
    title="Kubernetes Guided Install"
    alt="Kubernetes Guided Install"
    src={infrastructurePrometheusScrapeOnlyMetrics}
  />

- If you used Helm, add the following values in your prometheus-agent configuration:
  ```yaml
  kubernetes:
    integrations_filter:
      enabled: false
  ```

### Kubernetes target discovery [#k8s-target-discovery]

Kubernetes jobs discover targets and scrape targets according to the `target_discovery` configuration. If inside the `target_discovery` configuration, you set `pod` and `endpoints` toggles to `true`, Prometheus will create rules to discover any pod or endpoint in the cluster having an exposed port.

Use the `target_discovery.filter` configuration parameter to filter in the targets that Prometheus scrapes. Use the `label` and `annotation` labels to filter by current conditions, and the `AND` operator for all conditions.

The following example only scrapes `Pods` and `Endpoints` with the `newrelic.io/scrape: "true"` annotation, and the `k8s.io/app` label with `postgres` or `mysql` as values. For the endpoints, the annotation must be present in the service related to it. The regexes are anchored, that is, if you configure `scrape: 'true'`, Prometheus evaluates `true` as `^true$`. To avoid that, use `.*true.*` so it also matches `a-true-example`.

```yaml
kubernetes:
  jobs:
  - job_name_prefix: example
    integrations_filter:
      enabled: false
    target_discovery:
      pod: true
      endpoints: true
      filter:
        annotation:
          # <string>: <regex>
          newrelic.io/scrape: 'true'
        label:
          # <string>: <regex>
          k8s.io/app: '(postgres|mysql)'
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you don't add a value for the label or annotation, the filter will only check if it exists.
</Callout>

## Setup static targets [#setup-static-targets]

The prometheus agent defines a static target job to scrape self-metrics by default, but you can set up additional static targets by including additional jobs.

This following example includes an additional job to scrape a server managed separately, and the self-metrics job to keep reporting the prometheus agent metrics, as defined [by default](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml).

```yaml
static_targets:
  jobs:
    - job_name: managed-exporter
      targets:
        - "managed_exporter.your-company.tld:5432"
    - job_name: self-metrics
      skip_sharding: true  # sharding is skipped to obtain self-metrics from all Prometheus servers.
      targets:
        - "localhost:9090"
      extra_metric_relabel_config:
        - source_labels: [__name__]
          action: keep
          regex: "\
            prometheus_agent_active_series|\
            prometheus_target_interval_length_seconds|\
            prometheus_target_scrape_pool_targets|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_samples_pending|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_samples_in_total|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_samples_retried_total|\
            prometheus_agent_corruptions_total|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_shards|\
            prometheus_sd_kubernetes_events_total|\
            prometheus_agent_checkpoint_creations_failed_total|\
            prometheus_agent_checkpoint_deletions_failed_total|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_samples_dropped_total|\
            prometheus_remote_storage_samples_failed_total|\
            prometheus_sd_kubernetes_http_request_total|\
            prometheus_agent_truncate_duration_seconds_sum|\
            prometheus_build_info|\
            process_resident_memory_bytes|\
            process_virtual_memory_bytes|\
            process_cpu_seconds_total"
```

<Callout variant='caution'>
  If you modify the `static_targets` section and don't include self-metrics job, the agent metrics aren't reported.
</Callout>

## Target scrape interval [#target-scrape-interval]

By default, the Prometheus agent scrapes all targets for metrics every 30 seconds as defined in `common.scrape_interval` for all scraping jobs in the configuration. You can change this by using the `scrape_interval` key in that section.

This example shows two Kubernetes jobs with different scrape intervals:

``` yaml
common:
  scrape_interval: 30s
kubernetes:
  jobs:
  # this job will use the default scrape_interval defined in common.
  - job_name_prefix: default-targets-with-30s-interval
    target_discovery:
      pod: true
      filter:
        annotation:
          newrelic.io/scrape: 'true'

  - job_name_prefix: slow-targets-with-60s-interval
    scrape_interval: 60s
    target_discovery:
      pod: true
      filter:
        annotation:
          newrelic.io/scrape_slow: 'true'
```

## Metric and label transformations [#metric-label-transformations]

You can apply metric and label transformations cat any configuration section, but setting it at remote write level makes the filtering or transformations wider.

If you set them at `newrelic_remote_write` level, the filters apply to all metrics that are being sent to New Relic. If you set them at any other section, they apply to the metrics scraped by that section. The metric filter process happens after the metrics have been scraped from the targets.

You can use the `extra_metric_relabel_config` parameter to apply the filters, which adds entries of the [metric_relabel_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) parameter. This parameter is present at `static_targets.jobs`, `kubernetes.jobs`, and the `extra_write_relabel_configs` parameter for `newrelic_remote_write`.

Here's an example of how to use it in different parts of the YAML configuration file:

```yaml
static_targets:
- name: self-metrics
  urls:
    - 'http://static-service:8181'
  extra_metric_relabel_config:
  # Drop metrics with prefix 'go_' for this target.
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'go_.+'
    action: drop

newrelic_remote_write:
  extra_write_relabel_configs:
  # Drop all metrics with the specified name before sent to New Relic.
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'metric_name'
    action: drop
```

### YAML file snippet samples [#config-samples]

Add one of these examples in the YAML configuration file from the [metric and label transformations](#metric-label-transformations) section.

#### To add or remove metric labels [#filter-metric-labels]

<Callout variant="important">
  Metric Labels names must comply with [Prometheus DataModel](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels).
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="collapser-source"
    title="Add the 'new_label=newLabelValue' labels to metrics names starting with 'prefix_'"
  >
    ```yaml
    - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'prefix_.+'
    target_label: new_label
    action: replace
    replacement: newLabelValue
    ```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="collapser-source"
    title="Filter out all metrics the label 'label_name'"
  >
    You can use it to reduce cardinality, but keep in mind that removing identifying labels may make it difficult to ensure proper metric aggregation.

    ```yaml
    - regex: 'label_name'
    action: labeldrop
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Target authorization configuration [#target-authorization-configuration]

Some targets need access authorization to be scraped, like No-SQL Databases to fetch data that the user connecting has access, or exporters that expose sensible data in their metrics endpoint. All authorization methods supported by Prometheus can be configured in the `static_targets` and `kubernetes` sections.

As explained in the [Installation guide](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent) we create a configuration for Prometheus based on our YAML. This part of the configuration passed to Prometheus as-is from our YAML, so you would refer to Prometheus documentation:
- [TLS](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config)
- [OAuth2](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#oauth2)
- [Authorization Header](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config)
- Basic Auth

Here are some examples to deal with targets that need access authorization:

```yaml
kubernetes:
  jobs:
  - job_name_prefix: skip-verify-on-https-targets
    target_discovery:
      pod: true
      filter:
        annotation:
          newrelic.io/scrape: 'true'
  - job_name_prefix: bearer-token
    target_discovery:
      pod: true
      filter:
        label:
          k8s.io/app: my-app-with-token
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials_file: '/etc/my-app/token'

startic_targets:
  jobs:
  - job_name: mtls-target
    scheme: https
    targets:
    - 'my-mtls-target:8181'
    tls_config:
      ca_file: '/etc/my-app/client-ca.crt'
      cert_file: '/etc/my-app/client.crt'
      key_file: '/etc/my-app/client.key'

  - job_name: basic-auth-target
    targets:
    - 'my-basic-auth-static:8181'
    basic_auth:
      password_file: '/etc/my-app/pass.htpasswd'
```
