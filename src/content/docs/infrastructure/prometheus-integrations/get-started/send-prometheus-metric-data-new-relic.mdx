This page provides an overview of the options for the Prometheus integrations of New Relic and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs.

## Prometheus OpenMetrics, Prometheus agent or remote write integration? [#pomi-remote_write]

We currently offer three alternatives to send Prometheus metrics to New Relic.

* [Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes](#Agent).
* [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker](#OpenMetrics).
* [Prometheus remote write integration](#remote-write)

If you already have a Prometheus server, we recommend getting started with the remote write integration. Otherwise, depending on your needs, you may choose between the [Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes](#Agent) and [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker](#OpenMetrics).

Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="prometheus-agent"
    title="Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes"
  >
Benefits:

* Easily instrument workloads running in your Kubernetes clusters.
* Predefined set of dashboards and alerts.     
* Full control of the telemetry data ingested.
* No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself.


Recommendations:
* The [scrape interval](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#target-scrape-interval) is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from the default value of 15s to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%.
* Set your filters and configure data to target. See how to [filter Prometheus metrics](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent/#drop-keep-metrics).
* Control the health of your Prometheus instances and shards by installing the Prometheus Agent quickstart.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="openmetrics-integration"
    title="Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker"
  >
Benefits:

* Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers.
* Store all your metrics directly in New Relic.
* No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself.
* No need for local storage.

Reminders:

* Slightly more complex setup.
* No support for High Availability replicas.
* The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="remote-write-integration"
    title="Prometheus remote write integration"
  >
Benefits:
* Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration.
* Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus.
* Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source.
* Prometheus [High Availability support](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/prometheus-high-availability-ha): We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest.

Reminders:
* You will need to manage your Prometheus servers.
* You can reduce your storage retention.
* Fewer query loads to the server.

Recommendations:
* Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better:
    * The [scrape interval](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%.
    * Set your filters and configure data to target. See [metrics or targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_action).
    * Balance remote writes between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits.
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations:

* You can use Grafana or other query tools via the Prometheus' API of New Relic.
* You benefit from more [nuanced security and user management options](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).
* The [database](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/nrdb-horsepower-under-hood) of New Relic can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place.
* You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic.

## Prometheus Agent for Kubernetes [#Agent]

The Prometheus Agent of New Relic allows you to easily scrape Prometheus metrics from a Kubernetes cluster. By leveraging on the service discovery and the Kubernetes labels, you'll get instant access to metrics, dashboards, and alerts of the most popular workloads.

You can install Prometheus Agent in two modes:

* [Alongside the Kubernetes integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent#kubernetes-install): Prometheus agent is installed automatically together with the [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration).
* [Standalone](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent#prometheus-install): If you don't need to monitor your Kubernetes cluster and only want to monitor workloads running on it, you can easily deploy the Prometheus agent just by running a single Helm command. Keep in mind that if you're only using the Prometheus agent, the Prometheus metrics won't be decorated with Kubernetes tags like cluster, pod, or container name.

With this integration you can:

* Automatically get insights from the most popular workloads. Take advantage of predefined set of dashboards and alerts.
* Leverage on [service discovery](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent/#k8s-target-discovery) to automatically monitor new services once deployed.
* Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI.
* Monitor big clusters by using [horizontal](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/scale-prometheus-instances#horizontal) or [vertical](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/scale-prometheus-instances#vertical) sharding.
* Monitor the health of your Prometheus shards and the cardinality of the metrics ingested.
* Full control of the data ingest by supporting different [scraping intervals](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#target-scrape-interval), [metric filters](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent/#drop-keep-metrics), and [label management](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent/#filter-metric-labels).

## Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker [#OpenMetrics]

The Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations of New Relic for Docker allow you to scrape [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform.

With this integration you can:

* Automatically identify a static list of endpoints.
* Collect metrics that are important to your business.
* Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI.
* Connect your [Grafana dashboards](/docs/integrations/grafana-integrations/get-started/grafana-support-prometheus-promql) (optional).

## Reduce overhead and scale your data [#OpenMetrics-reduce-overhead]

Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems.

Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server.

To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration [blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-monitor-prometheus-metrics/) of New Relic.

## Prometheus remote write integration [#remote-write]

Unlike the [Prometheus Agent](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent) and [Docker](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-docker) OpenMetrics integrations, which scrape data from Prometheus endpoints, the remote write integration allows you to forward [telemetry data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform) from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. You can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and beyond.

### Scale your data and get moving quickly [#remote-write-scale]

With the Prometheus remote write integration you can:

* Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform.
* Combine and group data across your entire software stack.
* Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you're monitoring.
* Connect your [Grafana dashboards](/docs/integrations/grafana-integrations/get-started/grafana-support-prometheus-promql) (optional).
