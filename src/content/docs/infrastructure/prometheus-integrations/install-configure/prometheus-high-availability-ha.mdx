If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see [Set up your Prometheus remote write integration](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration).

## External labels [#prometheus-labels]

New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Label name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>

      <th>
        Example value
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `prometheus`
      </td>

      <td>
        A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers.
      </td>

      <td>
        `monitoring-cluster`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `prometheus_replica`
      </td>

      <td>
        A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data.
      </td>

      <td>
        `replica-1`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus.

## Prometheus Operator [#kubernetes-operator]

These external labels are added by default if you use [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the [helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/prometheus-operator).

The operator sets the value of the `prometheus` label (the one identifying a cluster) as `<prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>`. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is `monitoring` and the name of the deployment is `prometheus-cluster1`, the value is `monitoring/prometheus-cluster1`.

The operator sets the value of the `prometheus_replica` label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format `replica-<replica number>`, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have [`replicaExternalLabelName` or `prometheusExternalLabelName`](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#prometheusspec) in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name.
</Callout>

## Standalone Prometheus

When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the [configuration file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/). Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster:

<DNT>**Replica 1**</DNT> (`prometheus.yml`)

```
global:
	external_labels:
		prometheus: monitoring-cluster
		prometheus_replica: replica-1
```

<DNT>**Replica 2**</DNT> (`prometheus.yml)`

```
global:
	external_labels:
		prometheus: monitoring-cluster
		prometheus_replica: replica-2
```
