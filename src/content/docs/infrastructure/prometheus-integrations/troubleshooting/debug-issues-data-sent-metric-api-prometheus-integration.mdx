## Problem

You are having problems identifying the cause behind issues reported with data being sent to New Relic's [Metric API](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api). You want to see the exact data being sent from your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes to the Metric API.

## Solution

You can configure the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to show the raw data being sent to the standard output stream. To see the exact data that is being sent to the Metric API, set the `EMITTERS` environment variable to `"api,stdout"`.
