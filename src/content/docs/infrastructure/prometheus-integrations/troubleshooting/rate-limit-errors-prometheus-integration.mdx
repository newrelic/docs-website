## Problem

Your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes exceeded allowable metric rate limits. You want to see more details about why the [`NrIntegrationError` event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror) has been applied to your New Relic account.

## Solution

To examine rate limit errors:

1. Run a query of Prometheus metrics using the [`NrIntegrationError` event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/nrintegrationerror), like this:

   ```
   FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT * WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics'
   ```
2. Review additional [troubleshooting procedures for `NrIntegrationError` events](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events).

To help prevent this from happening, you can use filters to control the types and amount of data that your integration sends to New Relic. For more information, see [Ignore or include Prometheus metrics](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/ignore-or-include-prometheus-metrics).

## Cause

New Relic does a basic validation of your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration metrics when they are submitted. More extensive validation is performed asynchronously when processing the metrics.

If New Relic finds errors during this asynchronous validation, the errors are put into an `NrIntegrationError` event in your New Relic account. For example, if you exceed the metric limits defined for Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations, New Relic will apply rate limits to your account and create an associated `NrIntegrationError` event.
