With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can combine filters into a **filter set** to organize hosts based on criteria that matter the most to you.

Read on to learn about the benefits, use, and logic of filter sets.

## Benefits of filter sets

You can create filter sets based on any [infrastructure attributes](/docs/infrastructure-events-attributes) or labels.

For example, you can organize your infrastructure into categories such as:

* Regions
* Operating system versions
* Hosts associated with Docker containers
* Test environments (using [custom attributes](/docs/meatballs-configuring-your-agent#attributes))

You can share filter sets with other people in your account, and you can quickly identify infrastructure problems by checking the color-coded [health status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) of each host in the filter set.

## Create filter sets

The default infrastructure filter set is **All hosts**, and it serves as a template for you to create filter sets.

To create a filter set:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> (click Hosts, Inventory, or Events).**
2. If **All hosts** is not displayed in the left sidebar, open that filter set by selecting **Saved filter sets > All hosts**.
3. In the **All hosts** filter set, click **Filter hosts**.
4. In the list of **Attributes** and **Labels**, click an attribute or label to open the list of values.
5. Click **Include** or **Exclude** (see [Filter set logic](#logic)).
6. Click values individually or enter text to match multiple values.
7. Continue adding filters until you have the filter set you want.
8. To name your filter, click the <Icon name="edit-2"/>
   icon, type a name, and click **Save**.

## Edit filter sets

To change an existing filter set:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> (click Hosts, Inventory, or Events)**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Saved filter sets** to open a list.
3. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term.
4. Click the filter set to open it.
5. In the sidebar, click an option to update your filter set, and then save.

## Delete filter sets

You can delete any saved filter set except the default **All hosts**.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> Settings > Filter sets**.
2. Click <Icon name="trash-2"/>
   to delete the filter set.

## Combine filter sets with grouping

On some pages you can use [**Group by**](/docs/infrastructure-group-results-specific-attributes) to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, on the **Hosts** page, you can group by `awsRegion` to display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage.

Grouping applies to the selected filter sets. By combining filter sets with grouping, you can find detailed system information quickly. For an example of using these tools to troubleshoot a problem, see [Combining filter sets and grouping](/docs/infrastructure-group-results-specific-attributes#scoping-and-grouping).

## Copy filters from filter set to alerts

When you create an alert condition, you can build filters individually, or you can copy all the filters from a filter set into a new alert condition. This is a quick shortcut to populate a new alert condition with some filters.

<Callout variant="important">
  When you copy filter set filters to a new alert condition, these filters are no longer tied to the filter set. If you make changes to the filter set, the alert filters are not affected.
</Callout>

To copy filter set filters to a new alert condition:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure** **> (click Hosts, Inventory, or Events)**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Saved filter sets** to open a list.
3. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term.
4. Click the filter set to open it.
5. Mouse over any chart and click **<Icon name="more-horizontal"/>
   \> Create alert**.
6. Enter an alert condition name.
7. Make adjustments to filters as necessary.
8. Complete the remaining alert fields (see [Create alert conditions](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#create-condition)).

## Filter set logic

When you create a filter set, you generate a list of attribute or label values to narrow the results. This section explains how filter sets apply various rules to the list.

### Inclusion and exclusion

As part of building a filter set, you designate whether a filter should include or exclude entities that match certain values.

The way the inclusion or exclusion works depends on how you select values:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="match-string"
    title="Recommended: Select values by matching a string"
  >
    You can generate a list of attribute/label values by entering a string that you want values to match. This is useful for matching multiple values.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      String matching efficiently generates a list of values, and this approach scales as you add new entities.
    </Callout>

    Here is the logic filter sets use with string matching:

    <Table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Comparator
          </th>

          <th>
            Logic
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Include
          </td>

          <td>
            If you click **Include** and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator `LIKE`, which means the results include any entities that are like the string.

            For example, you could filter by the term East-, and all entities that contain that term are returned.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Exclude
          </td>

          <td>
            If you click **Exclude** and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator `NOT LIKE`, which means the results exclude any entities that are like the string.

            For example, you could filter by the term West-, and all entities that do not contain that term are returned.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </Table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="select-individually"
    title="Select values individually"
  >
    You can click through the list of attributes/labels to identify individual values.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      This approach does not scale well if you add new entities.
    </Callout>

    Here is the logic filter sets use with individual value selection:

    <Table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Comparator
          </th>

          <th>
            Logic
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Include
          </td>

          <td>
            If you click **Include** and then click specific values under attributes/labels, the filter uses the comparator `IN`, which means the filter looks for entities that exactly match one or more values in your list of selections.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Exclude
          </td>

          <td>
            If you click **Exclude** and then click specific values under attributes/labels, the filter set uses the comparator `NOT IN`, which means the filter returns all entities that do not exactly match one or more values in your list of selections.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </Table>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### And/Or

Filter sets use the logical operators `AND` and `OR` behind the scenes to join the data.

Here are the rules for `AND` and `OR`:

* When you click values from multiple attributes or labels, the attributes or labels are joined by `AND`.
* When you click values from within an attribute or label, the values are joined by `OR`.

The filter results display hosts for which both of the following are true:

* Hosts containing any one of the selected infrastructure agent versions
* Hosts in any one of the selected AWS availability zones
