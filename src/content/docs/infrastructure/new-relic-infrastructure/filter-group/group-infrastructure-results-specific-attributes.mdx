In our infrastructure monitoring tool, you can use the **Group by** feature to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, on the Hosts page, you might display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage grouped by `awsRegion`.

**Group by** is available near the top of some [infrastructure monitoring UI pages](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui/infrastructure-hosts-page).

## Group charts by specific attributes [#grouping]

On some infrastructure pages you can use **Group by** to group page results and charts by a specific attribute, such as host name, entity ID, or AWS region. The attributes available to group by will depend on your system setup. These may include:

* [Default](/docs/infrastructure-events-attributes) infrastructure attributes
* [Custom attributes](/docs/infrastructure-configure-your-agent#attributes)
* [APM-related attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure#filter-by-app)

To group infrastructure results by a specific attribute:

1. On pages that have this feature, select **Group by** (located beside the time picker).
2. From the dropdown, select an attribute to group by.

## Combine filter sets and grouping [#scoping-and-grouping]

Grouping applies to any **[filter sets](/docs/infrastructure-organize-your-resources-scopes)** you have selected. By combining filter sets with **Group by**, you can find detailed system information quickly.

    On the **[Filter sets](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/organize-infrastructure-hosts-filter-sets)** sidebar, you see [alert threshold violations](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) as **Critical** <Icon name="fe-x-circle"/>
    icon or **Warning** <Icon name="fe-alert-triangle"/>
    icon on one of your filter sets.

    1. To view only the hosts related to the filter set on your Hosts page, click the filter set name.
    2. To determine which of the hosts is causing the problem, select **Group by**, then select the **hostname** attribute.
    3. Review the charts which now show the hosts, by name, with the highest CPU usage.
