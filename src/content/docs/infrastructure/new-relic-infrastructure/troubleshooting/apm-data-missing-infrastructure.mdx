## Problem

When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> or license keys from accounts in the same organization, APM data should appear in **infrastructure**, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips.

Please note if license keys from separate accounts within an organization are used a user must have access to both accounts to see the linked data.

## Solution

If you completed the [APM/Infrastructure integration](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure) but do not see APM data in **infrastructure**, try these troubleshooting procedures.

    If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from infrastructure monitoring and APM may not be linked.

    1. Restart your app server.
    2. Generate some traffic for your app.
    3. Wait a few minutes, and then check for [APM data in infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).

    If the hostnames are different in APM and the infrastructure UI, we cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as `myhost1.example.com`), while APM uses the host's name (such as `myhost1`).

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**.
    2. From the app's APM **Overview** page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring.
    3. If the names are different, either [set the APM agent host's `display_name`](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/add-rename-remove-hosts#display_name) to match its FQDN, or [set the host's `display_name` in the infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#display_name) to match the one set in APM.

    If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data.

    * To solve this problem, get help at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com/tickets/new).
    * To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.

    If you're hosting your APM-monitored application on Kubernetes, there are some additional integration steps that must be completed to link your data.

    * To ensure your data is linked, follow the steps provided to [link APM-instrumented applications to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-apm-applications-kubernetes/).
