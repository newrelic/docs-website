## Problem [#problem]

The agent is working, but the [infrastructure monitoring UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage) shows the wrong hostname.

## Solution [#solution]

To set the correct hostname, try the following steps:

1. Edit the [newrelic-infra.yml](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#config-file) configuration file and add the `override_hostname` option, whose value is your expected hostname. For example:

   ```
   override_hostname: correct-host.domain.com
   ```
2. Use [your init system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status#init-system) to restart the agent service:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="systemd-verify-status"
       title="Restart the agent with SystemD"
     >
       Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher:

       ```
       sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra
       ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="systemv-verify-status"
       title="Restart the agent with System V"
     >
       Use System V commands with Debian 7:

       ```
       sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra restart
       ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="upstart-verify-status"
       title="Restart the agent with Upstart"
     >
       Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower:

       ```
       sudo initctl restart newrelic-infra
       ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="windows-verify-status"
       title="Restart the agent in Windows"
     >
       ```
       net stop newrelic-infra
       net start newrelic-infra
       ```
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>

## Cause [#cause]

In Linux and macOS, the New Relic infrastructure agent tries to resolve its [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) against a domain name server, which may not be properly configured or not controlled by the same user as the New Relic infrastructure agent. In Windows, it resolves the domain name using internal tools.
