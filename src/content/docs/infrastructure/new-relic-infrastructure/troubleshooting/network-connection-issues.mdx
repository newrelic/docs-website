## Problem [#problem]

The infrastructure agent is experiencing network issues connecting to New Relic endpoints.
Connectivity errors such as `Collector endpoint not reachable` or `Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers` appear on the agent logs.

## Solution [#solution]

Verify that the New Relic infrastructure agent endpoints are reachable from the host where it's installed.
Follow the instructions below to confirm there are no issues with your environment's network settings:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="windows"

    In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://infra-api.newrelic.com/cdn-cgi/trace"
    ```

    The expected output should include a `200 (OK)` as shown below:

    ```json

    1. <DNT>**Resolve the domain:**</DNT> Use `nslookup` or `dig` to validate that the Linux system can resolve the domain to an IP address:

       ```bash
       nslookup infra-api.newrelic.com
       ```

       The output should contain a name and IP address.

    2. <DNT>**Ping the server:**</DNT> Try pinging the IP address obtained above to ensure you can reach the server.

       ```bash
       ping 162.247.241.2
       ```

       The server should be reachable.

    3. <DNT>**Traceroute:**</DNT> Use `traceroute` to check the network path between your system and the server:

       ```bash
       traceroute -I infra-api.newrelic.com
       ```

       Analyze the output to identify potential network issues, such as high latency or packet loss.

    4. <DNT>**Curl:**</DNT> Use `curl` to check if the endpoint is reachable:

       ```bash
       curl -v https://infra-api.newrelic.com/cdn-cgi/trace

       fl=366f101
       h=infra-api.newrelic.com
       ip=XX.YY.ZZ.ZZ
       ts=1696347098.76
       visit_scheme=https
       uag=curl/7.88.1
       colo=MAD
       sliver=none
       http=http/1.1
       loc=ES
       tls=TLSv1.3
       sni=plaintext
       warp=off
       gateway=off
       rbi=off
       kex=X25519
       * Connection #0 to host infra-api.newrelic.com left intact
       ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Troubleshoot with NRDiag [#nrdiag]

New Relic diagnostics tool `NRDiag` is a utility that can also be used to automatically detects network problems.
Follow these steps to run the infrastructure agent connection test:

1. Follow the [getting started](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/#get-started) steps to install `NRDiag` on your host.

2. Run the infrastructure agent connect test.

   ```bash
   ./nrdiag -t Infra/Agent/Connect
   ```

3. Validate the results, the expected output should look like the report below:

   ```bash
   Check Results
   -------------------------------------------------
   Info     Base/Env/CollectEnvVars [Gathered Environment variables of current shell.]
   Success  Base/Config/Collect
   Success  Base/Config/Validate
   Success  Base/Config/LicenseKey
   Success  Base/Config/ValidateLicenseKey
   Success  Infra/Config/Agent
   Success  Infra/Agent/Connect
   3 results not shown: 3 None
   See nrdiag-output.json for full results.
   ```

   Note that the `nrdiag Connect` task result is shown in `stdout`, it should also be collected with the `nrdiag_output.zip` file.
