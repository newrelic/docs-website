## Problem

The infrastructure agent is not starting, and logs are not created.

## Solution

Here are some troubleshooting options for [non-root users](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/linux-installation/linux-agent-running-modes) if the infrastructure agent is not starting and there are no logs:

### Check `requiretty`

To see if `requiretty` is causing logging issues:

1. In `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog`, look for the message `sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo` .

   <Callout variant="important">
     When [using old Linux versions](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020147#c9), sometimes the `nri-agent` user fails to execute a service because it does not have any TTY attached.
   </Callout>
2. If you find this message, edit your `/etc/sudoers` file with the `visudo` command and comment or remove the following line: `Defaults requiretty`
3. Save and exit the file.
4. Restart the `newrelic-infra` service.

### Review log permissions

Check the agent's permission to open `log_file`. It's possible that the log file you are using was created when the agent was running as root, and now the `nri-agent` user does not have permissions to write it.

To solve this, try one of these options:

* Change the owner of the log file.
* Change the `log_file` entry in the `/etc/newrelic-infra.yml` configuration file. Our installation scripts create the `/var/log/newrelic-infra/` folder for that purpose, so we recommend the following value:

  ```
  log_file: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log
  ```
