## Infrastructure version [#agent-version]

The infrastructure Integrations SDK v4 requires infrastructure agent version 1.13.0 or higher.

SDK v3 requires agent version 1.0.888 or higher.

For infrastructure agent version information and options for installation and updates, see the [Infrastructure release notes](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes).

For notes on SDK versions and changes, see the [change log](#change-log).

## Operating systems [#os]

Integrations built with the SDK can be compiled for either Linux or Windows operating systems.

## Data and file specifications [#data-specs]

Infrastructure on-host integrations can be created with any programming language, as long as they adhere to the [data and file specifications](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/create-activate-infrastructure-integration).

    If you've built an integration using the older Go language build tools and wish to update, see [Upgrade from GoSDK v2 to v3](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v2tov3.md) and [Upgrade from v3 to v4](http://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v3tov4.md).

    For updating the Infrastructure agent, see [Update the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
