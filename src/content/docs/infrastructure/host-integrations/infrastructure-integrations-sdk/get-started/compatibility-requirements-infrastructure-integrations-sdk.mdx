Before using the New Relic [Infrastructure integrations SDK](/docs/intro-infrastructure-integration-sdk) to create a custom on-host integration, make sure your system meets these requirements.

## Infrastructure version [#agent-version]

To use the infrastructure Integrations SDK v4, you must have the Infrastructure agent version 1.13.0 or higher.

To use SDK v3, you must have agent version 1.0.888 or higher.

For Infrastructure agent version information and options for installation and updates, see the [Infrastructure release notes](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes).

For notes on SDK versions and changes, see the [change log](#change-log).

## Operating systems [#os]

Integrations built with the SDK can be compiled for either Linux or Windows operating systems.

## Data and file specifications [#data-specs]

Infrastructure on-host integrations can be created with any programming language, as long as they adhere to the [data and file specifications](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/create-activate-infrastructure-integration).

            Changes to JSON format, including support for multiple entities. The new JSON format is referred to as protocol `2` (described in [JSON output](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-executable-file-specifications) documentation and also used in the [definition file](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-definition-file-specifications#def-header)).

            Uses newer set of Go language build tools (referenced as [GoSDK v3](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v2tov3.md)).

    If you've built an integration using the older Go language build tools and wish to update, see [Upgrade from GoSDK v2 to v3](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v2tov3.md) and [Upgrade from v3 to v4](http://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v3tov4.md).

    For updating the Infrastructure agent, see [Update the agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
