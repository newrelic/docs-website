There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration:

* General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic).
* Build a custom [New Relic app](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality.
* If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight [Flex integration tool](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration) (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations).

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though this SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments.

## What is the Infrastructure Integrations SDK? [#what-is-it]

Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK is what we used to build our [infrastructure agent on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations), which work in tandem with our infrastructure agent to report data from your hosts or services.

You can study the docs in this section to help you understand the file structure and configuration options for those integrations. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and customizing your integration.
