## Problem

Your integration is reporting data, but a few inventory attributes are missing.

## Solution

The following inventory key names are used internally by our platform. If
customer-provided integrations send inventory items with the same key name,
they will remain invisible to the user:

* `pid`
* `installed_epoch`
* `epoch`
* `time`
* `size`
* `boot_id`
* `product_uuid`
* `installed_time`
