import infrastructureActiveDirectoryDashboard from 'images/infrastructure_screenshot_full_active-directory-dashboard.webp'

With our Active Directory integration, you can easily monitor the health of your directory services environment and proactively alert on potential issues. 

Built with our infrastructure agent, the Active Directory integration gives you a set of pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and <InlinePopover type ="alerts" /> that let you view your most critical performance data, all in one place.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This integration falls under the **Community project** designation in our [Open Source categories](https://opensource.newrelic.com/oss-category). This code is developed in the open with input from the community through issues and PRs. There is an active maintainer team within New Relic, as well as troubleshooting support in the New Relic Explorers Hub and documentation available in the project repository.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To see your Active Directory data in New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent collects data from Performance Counters, Windows Services, PowerShell scripts, and Windows Event Logs and sends that data to New Relic, where you can use the telemetry to measure the health of your Active Directory environment.. 

There are two methods to install the infrastructure agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=8f14e646-461e-b010-4675-3a0658bb3d20) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. 
* [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.

## Instrument Active Directory with New Relic [#instrument]

To instrument Active Directory with the infrastructure agent, follow the below procedures between this doc and the [New Relic Active Directory integration repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-active-directory-integration). 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="step1"
    title="Step 1. Clone the repository"
    >
    Run the following command in your CLI to clone the New Relic Active Directory integration repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-active-directory-integration.git
    ```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="step2"
    title="Step 2. Copy the configuration files to your host"
    >
    Copy the relevant configuration files from the repository to the agent, replacing `$ROOT_PATH` with the path where you cloned the repository:

    ```powershell
    # integrations.d
    Copy-Item -Path "$ROOT_PATH\newrelic-active-directory-integration\integrations.d\*"     -Destination "C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d" -Recurse
    
    # logging.d
    Copy-Item -Path "$ROOT_PATH\newrelic-active-directory-integration\logging.d\*"     -Destination "C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d" -Recurse
    ```
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Once you've followed all these steps, you can install the [Active Directory quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/active-directory) from the New Relic I/O catalog to add the relevant dashboard and alerts.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

The collection of telemetry from Active Directory depends on various configuration and script files located in the infrastructure agent's directory structure like this:

```
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\
    ├── integrations.d
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.ps1
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.yml
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-checks.yml
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-failures.ps1
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-replication-partners.ps1
    │   └── windows-active-directory-services.yml
    └── logging.d
        └── windows-active-directory.yml
```

Each of these files works together to present a full observability footprint. The resulting telemetry in New Relic consists of Metrics, Events, and Log data.

### Performance Counters [#perfmon-counters]

Collection of Active Directory Performance Counters is accomplished via Flex using this PowerShell script and associated configuration file:

```
windows-active-directory-performance-counters.ps1
windows-active-directory-performance-counters.yml
```

The results of this collection are stored as events named `activeDirectoryPerformanceCounters`.

### Event details
