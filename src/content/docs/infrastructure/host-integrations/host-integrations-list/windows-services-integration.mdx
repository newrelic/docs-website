New Relic's Windows services integration collects data about the services running on your Microsoft Windows hosts and sends it to our platform. You can check the state and start mode of each service, find out which hosts are running a service, set up <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> for services, and more.

With our Windows services integration you can:

* Check all your Windows services, their state (running, stopped, etc.), start mode (auto, manual, etc.), and other service [metadata](#metadata).
* See which hosts are running specific Windows services.
* [Set alerts](#set-alerts) based on any Windows services that you are monitoring using New Relic.
* Install the [Windows Services Quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/winservices) or create your own <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> to track your Windows services.

Our integration is bundled with the [Windows infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows). If you're monitoring Windows hosts on New Relic, you only need to enable the integration to get Windows services data into our platform.

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Our integration is compatible with all [Windows versions supported](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent) by the New Relic infrastructure agent.

You must have <DNT>**version 1.12.1 or higher**</DNT> for our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows) installed on a supported host. The x86 Windows versions are not yet supported.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

    To use the Windows services integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. All our on-host integrations require the infrastructure agent, which helps expose and report metrics to New Relic.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure the Windows services integration [#configure]

    To activate and configure the Windows services integration:

    1. Change the directory to the integrations folder:

       ```shell
       cd C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\
       ```
    2. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```shell
       copy winservices-config.yml.sample winservices-config.yml
       ```
    3. Edit the `winservices-config.yml` file. By default, no service is included. To include and filter services, you must edit `include_matching_entities:`.

       Here's an example of the Windows services integration configuration with both a regex pattern matching all services named `win32.*` and a direct match for the `newrelic-infra` service:

       ```yml
         integrations:
           - name: nri-winservices
             config:
               exporter_bind_address: 127.0.0.1
               exporter_bind_port: 9182
               include_matching_entities:
                 windowsService.name:
                   - regex "win32.*"
                   - "newrelic-infra"
               scrape_interval: 30s
             timeout: 60s
       ```

    For more information, see our documentation about the [general structure of on-host integration configurations](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

    Restart your infrastructure agent:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Windows services integration ` to monitor your Windows services. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DNT>**+ Integrations & Agents**</DNT> page.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>.
    3. In the search bar, type `Windows services`.
    4. The Windows services dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

    Your Windows services dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up an alert [#set-alerts]

You can create Windows services <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> using NRQL conditions to get notified about state changes of the services you wish to monitor. Here are two examples of alert conditions that use Windows services data:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="service"
    title="Service is not running"
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'windows_service_state' AND state != 'running' FACET hostname, service_name
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="start-mode"
    title={<>Start mode is <InlineCode>auto</InlineCode>, but current state is not <InlineCode>running</InlineCode></>}
  >
    ```sql
    FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE start_mode = 'auto' AND state != 'running' FACET hostname, service_name
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## How it works [#process]

To get data from Windows hosts, our Windows services integration uses a reduced version of the [Prometheus exporter for Windows](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter), which exposes Prometheus metrics on the port specified in the agent configuration. The integration collects these metrics, transforms them into entities, filters them, and then sends them to New Relic.

## Metric data [#metrics]

The Windows services integration provides the following data:

<Callout variant="tip">
  This integration creates dimensional metrics, which return the numeric status supplied by the [Win32_Service class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-service). Enumeration of these metrics into readable string values is provided under the `start_mode` and `state` attributes.
</Callout>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Metric Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Enumerated Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `windows_service_start_mode`
      </td>

      <td>
        `start_mode`
      </td>

      <td>
        Start mode of the service. Possible values are:

        * `boot`
        * `system`
        * `auto`
        * `manual`
        * `disabled`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `windows_service_state`
      </td>

      <td>
        `state`
      </td>

      <td>
        State of the service. Possible values are:

        * `stopped`
        * `start pending`
        * `stop pending`
        * `running`
        * `continue pending`
        * `pause pending`
        * `paused`
        * `unknown`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Metadata [#metadata]

The Windows services integration sends the following metadata to New Relic:

* `display_name`: Name of the service as viewed in the services snap-in.
* `process_id`: Process identifier of the service.
* `run_as`: Account name under which a service runs. Depending on the service type, the format of the account name may be `DomainName\Username` or `Username@DomainName` (UPN). The value is taken from the `StartName` attribute of the `Win32_Service` class, which can be `NULL` (in that case, the label is reported as an empty string).
* `service_name`: Unique identifier of the service.

  <Callout variant="important">
    If the `StartName` attribute is `NULL`, the service is logged on under the `LocalSystem` account. For kernel or system-level drive, it runs with a default object name created by the I/O system based on the service name, for example, `DWDOM\Admin`.
  </Callout>
