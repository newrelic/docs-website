The Varnish Cache [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

- [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic).
- Linux distribution or Windows version [compatible with our infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).

## Quick start [#quick]

Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument.

The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment.

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the Varnish Cache integration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux installation"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-varnish`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy of the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `varnish-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows installation"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-varnish` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i <var>PATH\TO\</var>nri-varnish-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `varnish-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

- **Advanced:** It's also possible to [install the integration from a tarball file](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball). This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process.
- **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings, refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer
  to this
  [document](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/)
  for help.
</Callout>

Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the `env` section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section.

### Varnish Cache instance settings [#instance-settings]

The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(<strong>M</strong>) and inventory(<strong>I</strong>) information. Check the **Applies To** column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection:

The `varnish-config.yml` commands accept the following arguments:

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:

- Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way.
- Replacing the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more [here](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough).
- Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

### Labels/Custom attributes [#labels]

Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see [Configure the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#passthrough).
You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on.<br/>
Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice.

```
 labels:
   env: production
   role: varnish
```

## Example configuration [#example-config]

Example `varnish-config.yml` file configuration:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example"
    title="Example configuration"
  >
    This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory :

    ```
    integrations:
      - name: nri-varnish
        env:
          INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic
          PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          env: production
          role: varnish
        inventory_source: config/varnish
    ```

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see [Configuration](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > Third-party services** and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links.

In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#event):

- `VarnishSample`
- `VarnishLockSample`
- `VarnishStorageSample`
- `VarnishMempoolSample`
- `VarnishBackendSample`

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as `bans.` or `main.`.

<Callout variant="tip">
  A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as
  the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are
  calculated as rates, refer to the [spec.csv
  file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-varnish/blob/master/spec.csv).
</Callout>

### Varnish sample metrics [#varnish-sample]

These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The Varnish Cache integration captures the configuration parameters. It parses the `varnish.params` configuration file for all parameters that are active.

The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/varnish** source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-varnish 'Link opens in a new window.') and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
