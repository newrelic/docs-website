## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your app's performance. The version should be 1.10.7 or higher to support NRI-Flex integration.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways:

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).
## Configure NRI-Flex for Apache Hadoop [#integrate]

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `nri-flex-hadoop-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```
2. Use our [configuration template](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/examples/json-read-cmd-example.yml) to update the fields `EVENT_TYPE` and `YOUR_DOMAIN` in the created file named `nri-flex-hadoop-config.yml`.
  The value on the `event_type` is used to store metrics on the NRDB.

  Example:
    * `EVENT_TYPE1` can be updated to `HadoopResourceManagerSample`
    * `EVENT_TYPE2` can be updated to `HadoopNameNodeSample`

  Your `nri-flex-hadoop-config.yml` file should look like this:

  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      # interval: 30s
      config:
        name: hadoopMetrics
        apis:
          - event_type: EVENT_TYPE1
            commands: 
              # run any command, you could cat .json file, or run some commands that produce a json output
            # the example just calls an API that returns json
              - run: curl -s https://YOUR_DOMAIN:9870/jmx #json output is retrieved from this command
          - event_type: EVENT_TYPE2
            commands: 
              - run: curl -s https://YOUR_DOMAIN:8088/jmx?qry=Hadoop:*
  ```
## Forward Apache Hadoop logs to New Relic

You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Apache Hadoop logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in this path:

```shell
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```
After creating the log file, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:


  ```yml
  logs:
    - name: hadoop_secondarynamenode_log
      file: /usr/local/hadoop/logs/hadoop-hadoopuser-secondarynamenode-hadoop-master.log
      attributes:
        logtype: hadoop_secondarynamenode_logs
    - name: hadoop_resourcemanager_log
      file: /usr/local/hadoop/logs/hadoop-hadoopuser-resourcemanager-hadoop-master.log
      attributes:
        logtype: hadoop_hadoop_resourcemanager_logs
    - name: hadoop_namenode_log
      file: /usr/local/hadoop/logs/hadoop-hadoopuser-namenode-hadoop-master.log
      attributes:
        logtype: hadoop_namenode_logs
  ```
## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```

In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).
##  Find your data

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Apache Hadoop` to monitor your Apache Hadoop server metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the **+ Add data** page. 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `apache hadoop`. 
4. The Apache Hadoop dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Apache Hadoop dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is a NRQL query to check the active users from the resource manager:

```sql
SELECT latest(activeUsers) 
FROM HadoopResourceManagerSample
```

Here is a NRQL query to view the number of active clients from the name node:

```sql
SELECT latest(numActiveClients) 
FROM HadoopNameNodeSample
```
