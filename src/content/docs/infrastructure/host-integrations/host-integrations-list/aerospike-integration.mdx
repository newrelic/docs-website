Our Aerospike integration monitors the performance of your Aerospike data platform, helping you diagnose issues in your application and optimize your code. Our Aerospike integration gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important Aerospike app metrics.

## Install [#install]

### Step 1: Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Aerospike app.

### Step 2: Install nri-aerospike application [#aerospike]

The Prometheus exporter application, `nri-aerospike`, is available on the apt-get repository. 

1. To install nri-aerospike, use the command below:

```
sudo apt-get install nri-aerospike
```
You'll know nri-aerospike was successfully installed because:
*  You'll see that the **Exporter** is installed in the `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin` directory
* A sample configuration file was created in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` directory

2. Rename the sample configuration file from `aerospike-config.yml.sample` to `aerospike-config.yml`

Your configuration file should look like this

```
integrations:
    - name: nri-aerospike
      config:
        # API URL of the aerospike service
        aerospike_db_host: localhost
        aerospike_db_port: 3000

        # Port to expose scrape endpoint on, If this is not provided a random port will be used to launch the exporter
        exporter_port: 9145

        # Cluster name is used on the aerospike.prometheus.json.template - all the metrics captured by nri-prometheus will be categorised under this cluster name
        aerospike_cluster_name: YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME
        scrape_timeout: 5s

        label_type: development
        label_source: aerospike

        exporter_files_path: /tmp
```

After you've successfully configured `nri-aerospike` you will be able to see the list of monitored Aerospike metrics in `http://localhost:9145/metrics`.

3. Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent. If you need more information, follow the [infrastructure agent documentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/).

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your Aerospike dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `Aerospike`. 
4. The Aerospike dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Aerospike dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query checking the percentage of memory capacity free on the namespace:

```
FROM Metric 
SELECT latest (aerospike_namespace_memory_free_pct)
```
