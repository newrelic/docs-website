<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

    To use the Envoy integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Envoy-specific data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Enable the Envoy integration with nri-prometheus

    To set up the Envoy integration, follow these steps:

    1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in the integrations directory:
       ```shell
       touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
       ```
    2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to enable the agent to capture Envoy data:

       ```yml
       integrations:
         - name: nri-prometheus
           config:
             # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true 
             standalone: false

             # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
             emitters: infra-sdk

             # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
             cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

             targets:
               - description: Envoy metrics list
                 urls: ["http://<ip-address>:9901/stats/prometheus"]

             #     tls_config:
             #     ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
             #     cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
             #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

             # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false
             verbose: false

             # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
             # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
             # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care
             audit: false

             # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
             # scrape_timeout: "30s"

             # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints
             scrape_duration: "5s"

             # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
             # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
             # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
             # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
             # many metrics are being scraped.
             # Default: 4
             # worker_threads: 4

             # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false
             insecure_skip_verify: true
           timeout: 10s
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Forward Envoy logs

    Follow these steps to forward Envoy logs to New Relic:

    1. Edit the log file named `logging.yml` located at the following path:

       ```shell
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d
       ```
    2. Add the following script to the `logging.yml` file. Replace `file` with your Envoy log filepath if needed:

    ```yml
    logs:
      - name: envoy.log
        file: /tmp/envoy.log
        attributes:
          logtype: envoy_logs
      - name: envoy-admin.log
        file: /tmp/admin_access.log
        attributes:
          logtype: envoy_admin_logs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

    Restart your infrastructure agent.

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Envoy` to monitor your Envoy application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DNT>**+ Integrations & Agents**</DNT> page
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>
    3. In the search bar, type `Envoy`
    4. The Envoy dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it

    Your Envoy dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

    Here is a NRQL query to check the Envoy downstream total connections:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(envoy_http_downstream_cx_total) as 'Downstream total connections' from Metric
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
