Our Temporal integration monitors the performance of your Temporal data, helping you diagnose issues in your write distributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable applications. Our Temporal integration gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important Temporal SDK app metrics.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

The New Relic infrastructure agent is the foundation for getting your Temporal data into New Relic. If you haven't already done so, install the agent using one of these options:

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=15321ec0-7cd8-0c04-52bf-7b65778f2e8c) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).

## Expose Temporal metrics [#expose-temporal-metrics]
To get the Temporal metrics you need to do some steps as followed:

Install the docker and docker-compose on your host.
```yml
sudo apt install docker
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
The following steps will run a local instance of the Temporal Server using the default configuration file `docker-compose.yml`:

1. Clone the repository.
```yml
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
```
2. Change directory into the root of the project, and
you need to add the prometheus endpoint and port in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
```yml
sudo nano docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
Environment:
  - PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT=0.0.0.0:8000
ports:
  - 8000:8000
```
3. Run the `docker-compose up` command.

```yml
sudo docker-compose up
```
You can check the Temporal server running on the below urls:

- The Temporal Server will be available on `localhost:7233`.
- The Temporal Web UI will be available at `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8080`
- The Temporal server metrics will be available on the `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8080/metrics`

## Expose Java SDK metrics [#expose-java-sdk-metrics]

You can set up the Prometheus registry and Micrometer stats reporter, set the scope, and expose an endpoint from which Prometheus can scrape the SDK Client metrics in the following way.

1. To create `MetricsWorker.java` file in your project main folder like as below.

```java
//...
// You need to import the following packages to set up metrics in Java.
// See the Developer's guide for packages required for the other SDKs.
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import com.uber.m3.tally.RootScopeBuilder;
import com.uber.m3.tally.Scope;
import com.uber.m3.util.Duration;
import com.uber.m3.util.ImmutableMap;

  // See the Micrometer documentation for configuration details on other supported monitoring systems.
  // This example shows how to set up the Prometheus registry and stats reported.

  PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
  StatsReporter reporter = new MicrometerClientStatsReporter(registry);

   // set up a new scope, report every 10 seconds
    Scope scope = new RootScopeBuilder()
            .tags(ImmutableMap.of(
                         "workerCustomTag1",
                         "workerCustomTag1Value",
                         "workerCustomTag2",
                         "workerCustomTag2Value"))
            .reporter(reporter)
            .reportEvery(com.uber.m3.util.Duration.ofSeconds(10));

  // For Prometheus collection, expose the scrape endpoint at port 8077. See Micrometer documentation for details on starting the Prometheus scrape endpoint. For example,
  HttpServer scrapeEndpoint = MetricsUtils.startPrometheusScrapeEndpoint(registry, 8077); //note: MetricsUtils is a utility file with the scrape endpoint configuration. See Micrometer docs for details on this configuration.
  // Stopping the starter stops the HTTP server that exposes the scrape endpoint.
  //Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> scrapeEndpoint.stop(1)));

  //Create Workflow service stubs to connect to the Frontend Service.
  WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newServiceStubs(
         WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                 .setMetricsScope(scope) //set the metrics scope for the WorkflowServiceStubs
                 .build());

  //Create a Workflow service client, which can be used to start, signal, and query Workflow Executions.
  WorkflowClient yourClient = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service,
         WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder().build());

  //...
```
2. Go to your project directory and build.
```yml
./gradlew build
```
3. Start the Worker.
```yml
./gradlew -q execute -PmainClass=<YOUR_METRICS_FILE>
```
4. See the worker metrics on the exposed Prometheus Scrape Endpoint: `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8077/metrics`.

## Configuring NRI-Prometheus [#configure-prometheus]

After successful installation, New Relic infrastructure agent. To create a nri-prometheus configuration file follow these steps:

1. Create file with named `nri-prometheus-temporal-config.yml` in this path:
```yml
cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/
```
After creating the `nri-prometheus-temporal-config.yml` file, you need to update the urls with `YOUR_HOST_IP`:

urls: `["http://<YOUR_HOST_IP>:8000/metrics", "http://<YOUR_HOST_IP>:8077/metrics"]`

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      standalone: false
      # Defaults to true. When standalone is set to `false`, `nri-prometheus` requires an infrastructure agent to send data.
      emitters: infra-sdk
      # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
      cluster_name: Temporal_Server_Metrics
      # Match the name of your cluster with the name seen in New Relic.
      targets:
        - description: Temporal_Server_Metrics
          urls: ["http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8000/metrics", "http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8077/metrics"]
      #    tls_config:
      #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"
      verbose: false
      # Defaults to false. This determines whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode.
      audit: false
      # Defaults to false and does not include verbose mode. Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic and can lead to a high log volume.
      # scrape_timeout: "YOUR_TIMEOUT_DURATION"
      # `scrape_timeout` is not a mandatory configuration and defaults to 30s. The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints.
      scrape_duration: "5s"
      # worker_threads: 4
      # `worker_threads` is not a mandatory configuration and defaults to `4` for clusters with more than 400 endpoints. Slowly increase the worker thread until scrape time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`. Note: Increasing this value too much results in huge memory consumption if too many metrics are scraped at once.
      insecure_skip_verify: false
      # Defaults to false. Determins if the integration should skip TLS verification or not.
    timeout: 10s
```
2. Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```
In a couple of minutes, your Temporal will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/).

## Find your data [#find-your-data]

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named Temporal to monitor your Temporal metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), go to the **+ Add data** page.
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type **Temporal**.
4. The Temporal dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Temporal dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the Dashboards UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).


Here is a NRQL query to check the Temporal request latency sum:

```sql
SELECT sum(temp oral_request_latency_sum) FROM Metric WHERE scrapedTargetURL = 'http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8000/metrics'

```
