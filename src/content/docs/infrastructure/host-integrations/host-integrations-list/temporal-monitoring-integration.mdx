<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

    To use the Temporal integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Temporal-specific data such as database and instance metrics.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Expose Temporal metrics [#expose-temporal-metrics]

    The following steps will run a local instance of the Temporal Server using the default configuration file `docker-compose.yml`:

    1. If you don't already have it, install  `docker` and `docker-compose` on your host:

       ```shell
       sudo apt install docker
       sudo apt install docker-compose
       ```

    2. Clone the repository:

       ```shell
       git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
       ```

    3. Change directory into the root of the project:

       ```shell
       sudo nano docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
       ```

    4. Add the Prometheus endpoint and port to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

       ```yml
       Environment:
       - PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT=0.0.0.0:8000
       ports:
       - 8000:8000
       ```

    5. Run the `docker-compose up` command to build your instance:

       ```shell
       sudo docker-compose up
       ```

    6. Confirm your instance is running correctly on the following URLs:

       * The Temporal server will be available on `localhost:7233`.
       * The Temporal web UI will be available at `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:8080`
       * The Temporal server metrics will be available on the `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:8000/metrics`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Expose Java SDK metrics [#expose-java-sdk-metrics]

    Now you'll expose SDK Client metrics that Prometheus will scrape:

    1. Create a `MetricsWorker.java` file in your project main folder:

       ```java
       //...
       // You need to import the following packages to set up metrics in Java.
       // See the Developer's guide for packages required for the other SDKs.
       import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
       import com.uber.m3.tally.RootScopeBuilder;
       import com.uber.m3.tally.Scope;
       import com.uber.m3.util.Duration;
       import com.uber.m3.util.ImmutableMap;

       // See the Micrometer documentation for configuration details on other supported monitoring systems.
       // This example shows how to set up the Prometheus registry and stats reported.

       PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
       StatsReporter reporter = new MicrometerClientStatsReporter(registry);

       // set up a new scope, report every 10 seconds
           Scope scope = new RootScopeBuilder()
                   .tags(ImmutableMap.of(
                               "workerCustomTag1",
                               "workerCustomTag1Value",
                               "workerCustomTag2",
                               "workerCustomTag2Value"))
                   .reporter(reporter)
                   .reportEvery(com.uber.m3.util.Duration.ofSeconds(10));

       // For Prometheus collection, expose the scrape endpoint at port 8077. See Micrometer documentation for details on starting the Prometheus scrape endpoint. For example,
       HttpServer scrapeEndpoint = MetricsUtils.startPrometheusScrapeEndpoint(registry, 8077); //note: MetricsUtils is a utility file with the scrape endpoint configuration. See Micrometer docs for details on this configuration.
       // Stopping the starter stops the HTTP server that exposes the scrape endpoint.
       //Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> scrapeEndpoint.stop(1)));

       //Create Workflow service stubs to connect to the Frontend Service.
       WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newServiceStubs(
               WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                       .setMetricsScope(scope) //set the metrics scope for the WorkflowServiceStubs
                       .build());

       //Create a Workflow service client, which can be used to start, signal, and query Workflow Executions.
       WorkflowClient yourClient = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service,
               WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder().build());

       //...
       ```

    2. Go to your project directory and build your project:

       ```shell
       ./gradlew build
       ```

    3. Start the worker:

       ```shell
       ./gradlew -q execute -PmainClass=<YOUR_METRICS_FILE>
       ```

    4. Check your worker metrics on the exposed Prometheus Scrape Endpoint: `http://YOUR_DOMAIN:8077/metrics`.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure NRI-Prometheus [#configure-prometheus]

    After a successful installation, make these NRI-Prometheus configurations:

    1. Create file with named `nri-prometheus-temporal-config.yml` in this path:

       ```shell
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/
       ```

    2. Here's an example config file. Make sure to update the placeholder URLs:

       ```yml
       integrations:
       - name: nri-prometheus
           config:
           standalone: false
           # Defaults to true. When standalone is set to `false`, `nri-prometheus` requires an infrastructure agent to send data.
           emitters: infra-sdk
           # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
           cluster_name: Temporal_Server_Metrics
           # Match the name of your cluster with the name seen in New Relic.
           targets:
               - description: Temporal_Server_Metrics
               urls: ["http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8000/metrics", "http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8077/metrics"]
           #    tls_config:
           #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
           #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
           #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"
           verbose: false
           # Defaults to false. This determines whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode.
           audit: false
           # Defaults to false and does not include verbose mode. Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic and can lead to a high log volume.
           # scrape_timeout: "YOUR_TIMEOUT_DURATION"
           # `scrape_timeout` is not a mandatory configuration and defaults to 30s. The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints.
           scrape_duration: "5s"
           # worker_threads: 4
           # `worker_threads` is not a mandatory configuration and defaults to `4` for clusters with more than 400 endpoints. Slowly increase the worker thread until scrape time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`. Note: Increasing this value too much results in huge memory consumption if too many metrics are scraped at once.
           insecure_skip_verify: false
           # Defaults to false. Determins if the integration should skip TLS verification or not.
           timeout: 10s
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure Temporal logs [#temporal-logs-configuration]

    To configure Temporal logs, follow the steps outlined below.

    1. Run this Docker command to check the status of running containers:

       ```shell
       sudo docker ps
       ```

    2. Copy the container ID for the **temporalio/ui** container and execute this command:

       ```shell
       sudo docker logs -f <container_id> &> /tmp/temporal.log &
       ```

    Afterwards, verify there is a log file named `temporal.log` located in the `/tmp/` directory.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Forward logs to New Relic [#temporal-logs-to-newrelic]

    You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Temporal logs to New Relic.

    1. On Linux machines, make sure your log file named `logging.yml` is in this path:

       ```shell
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
       ```

    2. Once you find the log file in the above path, include this script in the `logging.yml` file:

       ```yml
       logs:
       - name: temporal.log
           file: /tmp/temporal.log
           attributes:
           logtype: temporal_logs
       ```

    3. Use our instructions [to restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/):

       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
       ```

    4. Wait a few minutes until data starts folowing into your [New Relic account](https://one.newrelic.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#find-your-data]

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named Temporal to monitor your Temporal metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), go to the **+ Integrations & Agents** page.
    2. Click on **Dashboards**.
    3. In the search bar, type **Temporal**.
    4. When the Temporal dashboard appears, click to install it.

    Your Temporal dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the Dashboards UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

    Here is a NRQL query to check the Temporal request latency sum:

    ```sql
    SELECT sum(temporal_request_latency_sum) FROM Metric WHERE scrapedTargetURL = 'http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>:8000/metrics'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
