The PerfMon integration provides query and event results from the [Microsoft Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc749154(v%3dws.11)) to a standard output (stdout) that is consumable by New Relic.

To get started, see the [Windows PerfMon / WMI On-Host Integration README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-perfmon) on GitHub.
