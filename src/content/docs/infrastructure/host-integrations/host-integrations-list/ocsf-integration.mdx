Use New Relic to seamlessly monitor Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) data. You'll get comprehensive visibility into security-related data from multiple sources to facilitate threat detection, alert event response, and compliance.

## Set up the OCSF integration [#set-up-ocsf]

Complete the following steps to set up the OCSF integration:

<Steps>
    <Step>
## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

To use the OCSF integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with OCSF-specific data.
    </Step>
    <Step>

## Enable the OCSF integration with `nri-flex` [#enable]

1. Create a file named `nri-ocsf.yml` in the integrations directory:

  ```shell
  touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-ocsf.yml
  ```

2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-ocsf.yml` file to enable the agent to capture OCSF data:

  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      config:
        name: ocsfExample
        global:
          base_url: http://ip-address:PORT
          headers:
            accept: application/json
        apis:
          - event_type: ocsfSampleEvent       # use this name to query the data
            url: /customEndpoint               # endpoint with OCSF data
          - event_type: ocsfCustomEvent1      
            url: /customEndpoint2
  ```
    </Step>

    <Step>

## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent [#restat-agent]

Use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent. This is command that should work for most people:

  ```shell
  sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
  ```

    </Step>
    <Step>

## Find your data [#find-data]

You can use our pre-built dashboard template to monitor your OCSF application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > + Integrations & Agents**</DNT>.

2. Select <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> to access the pre-built resources. 

3. Search <DNT>**OCSF**</DNT> and select the dashboard.

To instrument the OCSF quickstart and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [OCSF quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/ocsf) by clicking on the <DNT>**Install now**</DNT> button.

Here is an example NRQL query to view the OCSF master uptime:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ocsfSampleEvent
``` 
    </Step>
</Steps>
