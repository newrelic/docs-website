Our MySQL [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems.

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps:

1. [Enabling your MySQL Server](#enable-instance).
2. [Install and activate the integration](#install).
3. [Configure the integration](#config).
4. [Find and use data](#find-and-use).
5. Optionally, see [MySQL's configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mySQL/mysql-config).

## Compatibility and requirements [#req]

### MySQL versions [#mysql-versions]

Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher.

<Callout variant="important">
  For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: `db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes`, `db.qCacheHitRatio`, and `db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond`.
</Callout>

### Supported operating systems [#supported-os]

* Windows <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Windows" alt="Windows" src={windows}/>
* Linux <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Linux" alt="Linux" src={linux}/>

For a comprehensive list of specific Windows and Linux versions, check the table of [compatible operating systems](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#operating-systems).

### System requirements [#system-reqs]

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise:
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Kubernetes" alt="Kubernetes" src={kubernetes}/>Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="ECS" alt="ECS" src={ecs}/>Amazon ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

### Enabling your MySQL Server [#enable-instance]

To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client) and [select](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics.

1. From the command line, create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password by running:
   ```shell
   sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

2. Grant replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running:
   ```shell
   sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

3. Grant privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running:
   ```shell
   sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

## Install and activate the integration [#install]

To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

### Linux installation [#linux-install]

1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), and use `nri-mysql` as filename.

2. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:
   ```shell
   cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
   ```

3. Copy the sample configuration file by running:
   ```shell
   sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml
   ```

4. Edit the `mysql-config.yml` configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some [great configuration file examples.](#examples).

5. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to [restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/#linux).

6. To enable automatic MySQL error log parsing and forwarding, copy (or rename) the `mysql-log.yml.example` file to `mysql-log.yml`. No need to restart the agent.

**Example:**

```
sudo cp /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/mysql-log.yml.example /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/mysql-log.yml
```

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration [#config]

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Kubernetes" alt="Kubernetes" src={kubernetes}/>Kubernetes, see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="ECS" alt="ECS" src={ecs}/>Amazon ECS, see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host, edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `mysql-config.yml`. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

## Configuration options for the integration [#config-options]

For more on how to find and use your data, see [MySQL's configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mySQL/mysql-config).

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring:

* Data from this service, which is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-dashboards/#nrql).
* Metrics are attached to the `MysqlSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see how to [understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metrics collected by the integration [#metrics]

The MySQL integration collects the following metrics:
