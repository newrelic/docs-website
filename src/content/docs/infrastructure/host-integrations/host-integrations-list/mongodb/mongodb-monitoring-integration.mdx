<Callout title="IMPORTANT!"> 
  This legacy integration is set to reach end-of-life in 2024: we'll add a specific EOL date when we know it. We recommend using our newer [MongoDB integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb/mongodb-monitoring-integration-new). For information on switching from the legacy integration to the new one, see our [migration docs](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb/mongodb-migration-guide).
</Callout>

Our legacy MongoDB integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MongoDB cluster to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data on `mongos` and `mongod` instances, config servers, as well as on databases and collections to help pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

This legacy integration is compatible with MongoDB v3 and v4. Our [newer MongoDB integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb/mongodb-monitoring-integration-new) supports newer versions. 

Before installing this legacy integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* MongoDB user with [`clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles](#users-privileges).
* If MongoDB is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host that's running MongoDB. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Install and activate [#install]

If you want to install our legacy MongoDB integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

    1. Install [the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations/#install), and replace the `INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME` variable with `nri-mongodb`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy of the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp mongodb-config.yml.sample mongodb-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `mongodb-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
    6. To enable automatic MongoDB error log parsing and forwarding, copy (or rename) the `mongodb-log.yml.example` file to `mongodb-log.yml`. No need to restart the agent.

       **Example:**

       ```
       sudo cp /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/mongodb-log.yml.example /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/mongodb-log.yml
       ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="windows-install"
    title="Windows"
  >
    1. Download the `nri-mongodb` .MSI installer image from:

       [https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mongodb/nri-mongodb-amd64.msi](https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mongodb/nri-mongodb-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\TO\nri-mongodb-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp mongodb-config.yml.sample mongodb-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `mongodb-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configuration [#configuration]

### Enabling your MongoDB server [#enable-instance]

In the [MongoDB shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/), execute the following commands to create a `listCollections` role and a new user. Then, assign `clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles to the new user. Note: Replace username, password, and similar user-specific values.

See the MongoDB documentation for details on [creating users](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/index.html) and [roles](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createRole/index.html).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Complete these steps on the mongos to be monitored. If mongod-level metrics
  are to be collected, such as host or replica set statistics, create the role
  and user on each mongod as well.
</Callout>

1. In the MongoDB shell, enter `use admin`.

2. Use the following command to create the `listCollections` role.

   ```
   db.createRole({
       role: "listCollections",
       privileges: [{
           resource: {db:"",collection:""},
           actions: ["listCollections"]
       }],
       roles: []
   })
   ```

3. Use the following commands to create a new user, and assign `clusterMonitor` and `listCollections` roles to the user.

   ```
   db.createUser({
       user: "username",
       pwd: "password",
       roles: [
           "clusterMonitor",
           "listCollections"
       ]
   })
   ```

### Configure the integration [#config]

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `mongodb-config.yml`.

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings, refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please see [standard configuration format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/) for help.
</Callout>

Specific settings related to MongoDB are defined using the `env` section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your MongoDB instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document.

The MongoDB integration can be configured to monitor either a full MongoDB cluster or a standalone MongoDB instance. To monitor a cluster, the `host` and `port` [arguments](#arguments) should point to one of the `mongos` instances in your cluster. If you want to monitor a standalone instance, make sure `host` and `port` point to the `mongod` running the database.

<Callout variant="tip">
  SCRAM authentication isn't supported.
</Callout>

### MongoDB instance settings [#instance-settings]

The MongoDB integration collects both metrics and inventory information. In the following table, see the **Applies To** column for the settings available to each collection.

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:

* Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way.
* Replacing the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0 or higher. For more information, see our documentation about [passthrough](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough), or see the [replacement example](#envvar-replacement).
* Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

### Labels and custom attributes [#labels]

You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on.

Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice.

```
 labels:
   env: production
   role: load_balancer
```

## Example configurations [#examples]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="basic-config"
    title="Basic configuration"
  >
    This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost:

    ```
    integrations:
      - name: nri-mongodb
        env:
          CLUSTER_NAME: my_cluster
          HOST: localhost
          PORT: 27017
          USERNAME: mongodb_user
          PASSWORD: mongodb_password
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          environment: production
        inventory_source: config/mongodb
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="basic-intervals"
    title="Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals"
  >
    This configuration collects metrics every 15 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds:

    ```
    integrations:
      - name: nri-mongodb
        env:
          METRICS: true
          CLUSTER_NAME: my_cluster
          HOST: localhost
          PORT: 27017
          USERNAME: mongodb_user
          PASSWORD: mongodb_password
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          environment: production

      - name: nri-mongodb
        env:
          INVENTORY: true
          CLUSTER_NAME: my_cluster
          HOST: localhost
          PORT: 27017
          USERNAME: mongodb_user
          PASSWORD: mongodb_password
        interval: 60s
        labels:
          environment: production
        inventory_source: config/mongodb
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="envvar-replacement"
    title="Environment variables replacement"
  >
    In this configuration we're using the environment variable `MONGODB_HOST` to populate the HOST setting of the integration:

    ```
    integrations:
      - name: nri-mongodb
        env:
          METRICS: "true"
          CLUSTER_NAME: my_cluster
          HOST: {{MONGODB_HOST}}
          PORT: 27017
          USERNAME: mongodb_user
          PASSWORD: mongodb_password
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          env: production
          role: load_balancer
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="filters"
    title="Filters"
  >
    In this configuration we're using filters to narrow down the databases and collections we monitor. With this sample filter the integration will collect:

    * `db1` database metrics and all its collections. Use `null` to collect all collections from a database
    * `db2` database metrics and metrics for `collection1` and `collection2`
    * `db3` database metrics and no collection metrics. Use an empty array `[]` if you want to skip collection metrics

      ```
      integrations:
        - name: nri-mongodb
          env:
            METRICS: "true"
            CLUSTER_NAME: my_cluster
            HOST: localhost
            PORT: 27017
            USERNAME: mongodb_user
            PASSWORD: mongodb_password
            FILTERS: '{"db1":null,"db2":["collection1","collection2"],"db3:":[]}'
          interval: 15s
          labels:
            env: production

      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="multi-instance"
    title="Multi-instance monitoring"

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Metrics are attached to these [event types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `MongoCollectionSample`
* `MongoConfigServerSample`
* `MongoDatabaseSample`
* `MongodTopSample`
* `MongoSample`
* `MongodSample`
* `MongosSample`

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The MongoDB integration collects the following metric data attributes. Some metric name are prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as `asserts.` or `collection.`.

Different metrics are available depending on whether a cluster or a standalone instance is being monitored. For a standalone instance, only [MongodSample](#mongod-clamshell), [MongoDatabaseSample](#mongo-database-clamshell), [MongodTopSample](#mongo-top-clamshell), and [MongoCollectionSample](#mongo-collection-clamshell) are collected. For a cluster, all event types are collected.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="mongo-collection-clamshell"
    title="Mongo collection sample metrics"

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The MongoDB integration captures all command line options and runtime-configured parameters from each host in the cluster.

The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/mongodb** source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mongodb) and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
