Our [VMware Tanzu integration](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-pcf-nozzle-tile) helps you understand the health and performance of your Tanzu environment. Query data from different Tanzu instances and cloud providers, and go from high level views down to the most granular data, such as the last duration of the garbage collector pause.

The integration uses [Loggregator](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-8/loggregator/architecture.html) to collect metrics and events generated by all Tanzu platform components and applications that run on cells. It connects to our platform by instrumenting the VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS) and the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To collect data from VMware PKS, use the [New Relic Cluster Monitoring](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/new-relic-cluster-monitoring/index.html) integration.
</Callout>

## Features

With the New Relic VMware Tanzu integration you can:

* Monitor the health of your deployments using our extensive collection of charts and dashboards.
* Set alerts based on any metrics collected from Firehose.
* Retrieve logs and metrics related to user apps deployed on the platform.
* Stream metrics from platform components and health metrics from BOSH-deployed VMs.
* Filter logs and metrics by [configuring the nozzle](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/new-relic-nozzle/index.html#filters) during and after the installation.
* Scale the number of instances of the nozzle to support different volumes of data.
* Use the data retrieved to monitor [Key Performance](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Capacity Scaling](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) indicators.
* Instrument and monitor multiple VMware Tanzu instances using the same account.
* Optionally send LogMessage and HttpStartStop envelopes to [New Relic Logs](/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/get-started-log-management), including [logs in context support](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents) for LogMessage envelopes.

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Our integration is compatible with VMware Tanzu (Pivotal Platform) version 2.5 to 2.11, and Ops Manager version 2.5 to 2.10. BOSH stemcells must be based on Ubuntu Xenial.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you need a VMware Tanzu account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This integration sends [custom events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/data-retention-components#components-insights-events) [and logs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-based-pricing/overview-data-retention-components#components-insights-events). If you find you are reaching the custom event data collection and data retention limits of your subscription, please reach out to your New Relic representative.
</Callout>

## Install and activate [#install-activate]

The quickest way to install the VMware Tanzu integration is by importing the [nr-firehose-nozzle](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle) tile into Ops Manager. For more information, [see the VMware Tanzu documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/new-relic-nozzle/index.html).

You can also deploy the nozzle as a standard application, edit the manifest, and run `cf push` from the command line; see how to build and deploy the integration [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-pcf-nozzle-tile).

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Once you install and activate the VMware Tanzu integration, you can find the data and predefined charts in [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > Third-party services > VMware Tanzu dashboard**. You can query the data to create custom charts and dashboards, and add them to your account.

If you collect data from multiple Tanzu environments, use `pcf.domain` and `pcf.IP` attributes with `WHERE` or `FACET` to discriminate between events from different Tanzu deployments.

<Callout variant="important">
  Tanzu metrics are aggregated in order to reduce memory and network consumption. However, you can increase the number of samples acting on the drain interval in the configuration.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
  Many **prebuilt dashboards and charts** displaying VMware Tanzu data are **available upon request**. Contact your New Relic representative to get them added to your New Relic account.
</Callout>

## Set up an alert [#setup-alert]

VMware Tanzu provides a list of indicators on [key performance](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/monitoring/kpi.html) and [key capacity scaling](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html), together with warning and critical values that you can monitor using [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).

Here is a sample [NRQL query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) that sets up an alert on memory consumption related to the `system` space:

```
SELECT average(app.memory.used) FROM PCFContainerMetric WHERE metric.name = 'app.memory' AND app.space.name = 'system' FACET app.instance.uid
```

Here is the resulting chart in New Relic One:

![VMWare Tanzu NRQL alert chart](./images/tanzu-alert-chart.png "tanzu-alert-chart.png")

For more information on NRQL queries and how to set up different notification channels for alerts, see [Create alert conditions for NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).

<Callout variant="important">
  Creating alert conditions from **Infrastructure > Settings** is currently not supported for this integration.
