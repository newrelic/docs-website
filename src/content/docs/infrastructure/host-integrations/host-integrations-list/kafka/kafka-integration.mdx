The New Relic Kafka [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) reports metrics and configuration data from your Kafka service. We instrument all the key elements of your cluster, including brokers (both ZooKeeper and Bootstrap), producers, consumers, and topics.

To install the Kafka monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps:

1. [Prepare for the installation](#prepare).
2. [Install and activate the integration](#install).
3. [Configure the integration](#config).
4. [Find and use data](#find-and-use).
5. Optionally, see [Kafka's configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config).

## Compatibility and requirements [#req]

### Kafka versions [#kafka-versions]

Our integration is compatible with Kafka version 3 or lower.

Please note [Apache Kafka EOL Policy](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Time+Based+Release+Plan#TimeBasedReleasePlan-WhatIsOurEOLPolicy) as you may experience unexpected results if you use an [End of Life](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html#cp-and-apache-ak-compatibility) Kafka version.

### Supported operating systems [#supported-os]

* Windows <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Windows" alt="Windows" src="/images/os_icon_windows.webp"/>
* Linux <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Linux" alt="Linux" src="/images/os_icon_linux.webp"/>

For a comprehensive list of specific Windows and Linux versions, check the table of [compatible operating systems](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#operating-systems).

### System requirements [#system-reqs]

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* If Kafka is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where Kafka is installed. Otherwise:
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Kubernetes" alt="Kubernetes" src="/images/os_icon_k8.webp"/>Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="ECS" alt="ECS" src="/images/os_icon_ecs.webp"/>Amazon ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* Java version 8 or higher.
* JMX enabled on all brokers.
* Java-based consumers and producers only, and with JMX enabled.
* Total number of monitored topics must be fewer than 10000.

### Connectivity requirements [#connectivity-requirements]

The integration needs to be configured and allowed to connect to:

* Hosts listed in `zookeeper_hosts` over the Zookeeper protocol, using the Zookeeper authentication mechanism, if `autodiscover_strategy` is set to `zookeeper`.
* Hosts defined in `bootstrap_broker_host` over the Kafka protocol, using the Kafka broker's authentication/transport mechanisms, if `autodiscover_strategy` is set to `bootstrap`.
* All brokers in the cluster over the Kafka protocol and port, using the Kafka brokers' authentication/transport mechanisms.
* All brokers in the cluster over the JMX protocol and port, using the authentication/transport mechanisms specified in the JMX configuration of the brokers.
* All producers/consumers specified in producers and consumers over the JMX protocol and port, if you want producer/consumer monitoring. JMX settings for the consumer must be the same as for the brokers.

<Callout variant="important">
  By default, security groups and their equivalents in other cloud providers, in AWS don't have the required ports open by default. JMX requires two ports in order to work: the JMX port and the RMI port. These can be set to the same value when configuring the JVM to enable JMX and must be open for the integration to be able to connect to and collect metrics from brokers.
</Callout>

## Prepare for the installation [#prepare]

Kafka is a complex piece of software that is built as a distributed system. For this reason, you need to ensure that the integration can contact all the required hosts and services so the data is collected correctly.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="autodiscovery"
    title="Autodiscovery"
  >
    Given the distributed nature of Kafka, the actual number and list of brokers is usually not fixed by the configuration, and it is instead quite dynamic. For this reason, the Kafka integration offers two mechanisms to perform automatic discovery of the list of brokers in the cluster: Bootstrap and Zookeeper. The mechanism you use depends on the setup of the Kafka cluster being monitored.

    ### Bootstrap

    With the [bootstrap mechanism](#bootstrap), the integration uses a bootstrap broker to perform the autodiscovery. This is a broker whose address is well known and that will be asked for any other brokers it is aware of. The integration needs to be able to contact this broker in the address provided in the bootstrap_broker_host parameter for bootstrap discovery to work.

    ### Zookeeper

    Alternatively, the Kafka integration can also talk to a [Zookeeper server](#zookeeper) in order to obtain the list of brokers. To do this, the integration needs to be provided with the following:

    * The list of Zookeeper hosts, `zookeeper_hosts`, to contact.
    * The proper authentication secrets to connect with the hosts.

      Together with the list of brokers it knows about, Zookeeper will also advertise which connection mechanisms are supported by each broker.

      You can configure the Kafka integration to try directly with one of these mechanisms with the `preferred_listener` parameter. If this parameter is not provided, the integration will try to contact the brokers with all the advertised configurations until one of them succeeds.

      <Callout variant="tip">
        The integration will use Zookeeper only for discovering brokers and will not retrieve metrics from it.
      </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="topic-listing"
    title="Topic listing"
  >
    To correctly list the topics processed by the brokers, the integration needs to contact brokers over the Kafka protocol. Depending on how the brokers are configured, this might require setting up SSL and/or SASL to match the broker configuration. The topics must have DESCRIBE access.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="broker-monitoring"
    title="Broker monitoring (JMX)"
  >
    The Kafka integration queries JMX, a standard Java extension for exchanging metrics in Java applications. JMX is not enabled by default in Kafka brokers, and you need to enable it for metrics collection to work properly. JMX requires RMI to be enabled, and the RMI port needs to be set to the same port as JMX.

    You can configure JMX to use username/password authentication, as well as SSL. If such features have been enabled in the broker's JMX settings, you need to configure the integration accordingly.

    If autodiscovery is set to bootstrap, the JMX settings defined for the bootstrap broker will be applied for all other discovered brokers, so the Port and other settings should be the same on all the brokers.
    <Callout variant="important">We don't recommend enabling anonymous and/or unencrypted JMX/RMI access on public or untrusted network segments because this poses a big security risk.</Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="consumer-offset"
    title="Consumer offset"
  >
    The offset of the consumer and consumer groups of the topics as well as the lag, can be retrieved as a [KafkaOffsetSample](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config/#KafkaOffsetSample-collection) with the `CONSUMER_OFFSET=true` flag but should be in a separate instance because when this flag is activated the instance will not collect other Samples.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="producer"
    title="Producer and consumer monitoring (JMX)"
  >
    Producers and consumers written in Java can also be monitored to get more specific metadata through the same mechanism (JMX). This will generate [KafkaConsumerSamples and KafkaProducerSamples](#KafkaConsumerSample-collection). JMX needs to be enabled and configured on those applications where it is not enabled by default.

    Non-Java producers and consumers do not support JMX and are therefore not supported by the Kafka integration.

## Install and activate the integration [#install]

To install the Kafka integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

### Linux installation [#linux-install]

1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), and replace the `INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME` variable with `nri-kafka`.

2. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:
   ```shell
   cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
   ```

3. Copy the sample configuration file by running:
   ```shell
   sudo cp kafka-config.yml.sample kafka-config.yml
   ```

4. Edit the `kafka-config.yml` configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some [configuration file examples.](#examples).

## Configure the integration [#config]

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="Kubernetes" alt="Kubernetes" src="/images/os_icon_k8.webp"/>Kubernetes, see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via <img style={{ width: '32px', height: '32px'}} class="inline" title="ECS" alt="ECS" src="/images/os_icon_ecs.webp"/>Amazon ECS, see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host, edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `kafka-config.yml`. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this [document](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/) for help.
</Callout>

As with other integrations, one `kafka-config.yml` configuration file can have many instances of the integration collecting different brokers, consumers and producers metrics. You can see config examples with one or multiple instances in the [`kafka-config.yml` sample files](#examples)

Specific settings related to Kafka are defined using the `env` section of each instance in the `kafka-config.yml` configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Brokers, Zookeeper, and JMX as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in [Kafka's configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config).

The integration has two modes of operation on each instance, which are mutually exclusive, that you can set up with the `CONSUMER_OFFSET` parameter:

* Consumer offset collection: set `CONSUMER_OFFSET = true` to collect [KafkaOffsetSample](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config/#KafkaOffsetSample-collection).
* Core collection mode: set `CONSUMER_OFFSET = false` to collect the rest of the samples: [KafkaBrokerSample, KafkaTopicSample](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config/#broker-collection), [KafkaProducerSample, KafkaConsumerSample](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config/#KafkaConsumerSample-collection).

<Callout variant="important">
  These modes are are mutually exclusive because consumer offset collection takes a long time to run and has high performance requirements, in order to collect both groups of Samples, set two instances, one with each mode.
</Callout>

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:

* Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way.

* Replacing the values from environment variables using the `{{ }}` notation. Read more about [using environment variable passthroughs with on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough) or see the example for [environment variables replacement](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-integration#envvar-replacement).

* Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [secrets management](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

### Offset monitoring

When setting `CONSUMER_OFFSET = true`, by default, only the metrics from consumer groups with active consumers (and consumer metrics) will be collected.
To also collect the metrics from consumer groups with inactive consumers you must set `INACTIVE_CONSUMER_GROUP_OFFSET` to `true`.

When a consumer group is monitoring more than one topic, it's valuable to have consumer group metrics separated by topics, specially if one of the topics have inactive consumers, because then it's possible to spot in which topic the consumer group is having lag and if there are active consumers for that consumer group and topic.

To get consumer group metrics separated by topic, you must set `CONSUMER_GROUP_OFFSET_BY_TOPIC` to `true` (it defaults to `false`)

For more on how to set up offset monitoring, see [Configure KafkaOffsetSample collection](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-config/#KafkaOffsetSample-collection).
