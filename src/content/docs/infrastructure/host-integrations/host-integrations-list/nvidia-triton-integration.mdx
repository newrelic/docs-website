<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

    To use the NVIDIA Triton integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with NVIDIA Triton-specific data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Enable the NVIDIA Triton integration with `nri-prometheus` [#enable-triton]

    The Triton server metrics are displayed at the URL `http://localhost:8002/metrics`.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      For additional details on collecting Triton server metrics, please refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/user_guide/metrics.html)
    </Callout>

    To set up the NVIDIA Triton integration, follow these steps:

    1. Run this command to create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in the integrations directory:

       ```shell
       touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
       ```

    2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to enable the agent to capture NVIDIA Triton data:

       ```yml
       integrations:
         - name: nri-prometheus
           config:
             # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
             standalone: false

             # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
             emitters: infra-sdk

             # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
             cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

             targets:
               - description: NVIDIA Triton metrics list
                 urls: ["http://localhost:8002/metrics"]

             #     tls_config:
             #     ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
             #     cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
             #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

             # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false
             verbose: false

             # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
             # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
             # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care
             audit: false

             # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
             # scrape_timeout: "30s"

             # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints
             scrape_duration: "5s"

             # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
             # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
             # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
             # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
             # many metrics are being scraped.
             # Default: 4
             # worker_threads: 4

             # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false
             insecure_skip_verify: true
           timeout: 10s
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## NVIDIA Triton logs configuration [#nvidia-triton-logs-configuration]

    To configure nvidia triton logs, follow the steps outlined below.

    1. Run this Docker command to check the status of running containers:

       ```shell
       sudo docker ps
       ```

    2. Copy the container ID for the **nvidia-triton** container and execute this command:

       ```shell
       sudo docker logs -f <container_id> &> /tmp/triton.log &
       ```

    Afterwards, verify there is a log file named `triton.log` located in the `/tmp/` directory.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Forwarding NVIDIA Triton logs to New Relic [#nvidia-triton-logs-to-newrelic]

    You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward NVIDIA Triton logs to New Relic.
    On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be in this path:

    ```shell
    cd /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
    ```

    Once you find the log file in the above path, include this script into the `logging.yml` file:

    ```yml
    logs:
      - name: triton.log
        file: /tmp/triton.log
        attributes:
          logtype: triton_logs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent [#restart-agent]

    Run this command to [restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent):

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, your NVIDIA Triton server will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#find-data]

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `NVIDIA Triton` to monitor your NVIDIA Triton server metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > + Integrations & Agents** and type
       **NVIDIA Triton**.
    2. Under **Dashboards**, click **NVIDIA Triton**.
    3. Click **Edit** if you want to change the account in the open popup window.
    4. Click **Setup NVIDIA Triton** or **Skip this step** if you already setup this datasource.
    5. Click **View dashboard**, and see your NVIDIA Triton data in New Relic.

    You can find your custom NVIDIA Triton dashboard in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. See our [dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) section for more information.

    Here is a [NRQL query](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to check the NVIDIA Triton CPU memory:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(nv_cpu_memory_total_bytes) / 1e+6 AS 'memory (MB)' FROM Metric
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
