<Callout

  title="EOL NOTICE"
>
  As of March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including our legacy SNMP monitoring integration. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com).
</Callout>

Our [network performance monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/) solution collects both [SNMP data](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring/) and [network flows](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring/). This functionality helps you the question **Is it the network?** faster.
