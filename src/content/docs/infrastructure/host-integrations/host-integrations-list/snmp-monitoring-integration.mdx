<Callout variant="important">
Have you tried our new [Network Performance Monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/)?

Collect both [SNMP](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring/) and [Network Flows](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring/) to answer the question _Is it the network?_ faster.
</Callout>

Our SNMP [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) monitors any application that exposes metrics with SNMP.

Read on to install the integration, and to configure a YAML file to start collecting metrics. This doc also contains sample YAML files to help you get started.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with SNMP version 2 or 3.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* SNMP monitoring enabled device or application.
* If SNMP is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux OS host that's running SNMP. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the SNMP integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-snmp`.
    2. Change directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration and metrics files:

       ```
       sudo cp snmp-config.yml.sample snmp-config.yml
       ```

       ```
       sudo cp snmp-metrics.yml.sample snmp-metrics.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `snmp-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. Edit the `snmp-metrics.yml` file as described in the [metric collection files](#metrics-collection).
    6. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configuration [#configuration]

### Configure the integration [#config]

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `snmp-config.yml`.

An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as `interval`, `timeout`, `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings, refer to our [Configuration Format](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics) document.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this [document](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format/) for help.
</Callout>

Specific settings related to SNMP are defined using the `env` section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your SNMP instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document.

### SNMP Instance Settings [#instance-settings]

The SNMP integration collects both metrics and inventory information. The type of metrics collected is determined by the information added to the [metrics collection file](#metrics-collection):

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:
* Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way.
* Replacing the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more [here](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough) or see the example [below](#envvar-replacement).
* Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

### Metric collection files [#metrics-collection]

The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the [metrics collection file example](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/snmp-monitoring-integration#collection-example).

Sample metrics collection file: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml.sample`

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See [configuration file](#collection-example) below for an example.
</Callout>

### Devices [#domains]

A collection file collects and organizes metrics. Each file contains a single `collect:` block which contains one or more devices. For each device, the following keys are defined:

* `device`: The name of the SNMP device from which metrics are being collected. This field is required.
* `metrics_sets`: A list of metric sets that organize metrics to collect from this device. See [Metric Sets](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/snmp-monitoring-integration#metric_sets).
* `inventory`: A list of Object Identifiers (OIDs) to collect from this device and report as inventory. See [Inventory](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/snmp-monitoring-integration#inventory).

### Metric Sets [#metric_sets]

Metrics Set represents a logical grouping of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to get from the SNMP device and report to New Relic. For each metric set, the following keys are defined:

* `name`: The metric set name.
* `event_type`: The [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) name for a collection from this metric set.

  For tips on naming event types, see [Naming tips](#data-naming).
* `type`: The metric set type. Use `scalar` to describe a metric set of SNMP scalar OIDs or `table` to describe a metric set that corresponds to the metrics from an SNMP table.
* `root_oid`: If `type` is a `table`, enter the root OID of the table. The integration performs an SNMP walk from this OID to get the table metrics.
* `index`: If `type` is a `table`, enter one or more table column index OIDs that define the table's row uniquely. For each index OID, the following keys are defined:
  * `oid`: The OID name to collect, for example, `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.2.1.1.1`. This field is required.
  * `name`: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name.
* `metrics`: List of SNMP OIDs to be collected as part of this metric set. Enter a list of `scalar OIDs` or `table column OIDs` as appropriate for the `type`.
  * `oid`: The OID name to collect, for example, `1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.2.0​`. This field is required.
  * `metric_name`: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name.
  * `metric_type`: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are `gauge`, `delta`, `pdelta`, `rate`, `prate` or `attribute`. If unspecified, the integration attempts to infer the metric type .

### Inventory

Inventory is an array of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to be collected and reported as inventory items. For each OID, the following keys are defined:

* `oid`: The OID name to collect, for example, `1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.4.0`. This field is required.
* `category`: The category name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required.
* `name`: The name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required.

## Tips for naming your data [#data-naming]

Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an [event](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) in New Relic’s event database.

You are responsible for creating and naming the SNMP data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme:

* Use camel case.
* Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains.

Example: `MyorgApplicationSample`

**Recommendation:** Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is not reported to an integration dashboard because the samples gathered are generally unique to the device being monitored. You will need to [build your own dashboard](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/create-edit-insights-dashboards).

SNMP metrics are attached to the user defined [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) specified in the [configuration file](#metrics-collection). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the collection they are collecting from. This metadata should be used in [NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired metric set.

Each event contains the following metadata:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "180px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `device`
      </td>

      <td>
        The device name for these metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `host`
      </td>

      <td>
        The SNMP host the metrics are being collected from.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `port`
      </td>

      <td>
        The SNMP port the metrics are being collected from.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `displayName`
      </td>

      <td>
        The metric set name for these metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The SNMP integration captures the configuration parameters of the SNMP integration. The data is available on the Infrastructure [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the **config/snmp** source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshoot]

Troubleshooting tips:

<CollapserGroup id="troubleshooting-list">
  <Collapser
    id="integration-errors"
    title="Search logs for errors"
  >
    If you are having trouble with the integration, first [enable and search the logs](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generate-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) for errors.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="metrics-limit"
    title="Metrics limit exceeded"
  >
    If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, you can check the [log file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generate-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) for this message:

    <Callout variant="important">
      "Metric Set x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This metric set will not be reported."
    </Callout>

    If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported metric set.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-snmp "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
