With our ActiveMQ dashboard, you can easily track your ActiveMQ logs, keep an eye on your critical brokers, and get a total overview of all components of your messaging system. Built with our infrastructure agent and our JMX integration, ActiveMQ dashboards take advantage of JMX scraping so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up ActiveMQ with New Relic, your data will display in a quickstart dashboard like this one, out of the box.

## Set up the JMX integration [#setup]

Before getting ActiveMQ data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing the JMX integration. If you haven't already:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=ff641d8b-e722-855e-4c4a-c50c23969dc3) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. Or, if you prefer, [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Install the [JMX monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/jmx-monitoring-integration).

## Get ActiveMQ metrics in a dashboard [#send]

Our ActiveMQ dashboard takes data scraped from your JMX integration and translates it into a collection of premade graphs and charts. Storing your data in New Relic gives you a full overview of your system's health and critical business points.

    title="Step 1. Update the `jmx-config.yml` file with the JMX service"
  >
The below YAML snippet connects your ActiveMQ metrics via `CONNECTION_URL` to jconsole, a Java tool that makes those metrics readable. If you're following along with the JMX integration install, this step corresponds with the configuration step. 

To update: 

1. Go to file path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jmx-config.yml`
2. Add this snippet:

```yml
integrations:
- name: nri-jmx
  env:
    COLLECTION_FILES: "/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jmx-config.yml"
    JMX_HOST: 127.0.0.1
    JMX_PASS: admin
    JMX_PORT: 8161
    JMX_user: admin
    CONNECTION_URL:
    REMOTE_MONITORING: "true"
  interval: 15s
  labels:
    env: staging
```

    title="Step 2. Update the `jvm-metrics.yml` with ActiveMQ metric names"
  >
This step organizes your metrics to be human readable once inside New Relic. Update the `jvm metrics.yml` file with any metrics that jconsole should capture:

1. Go to file path `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml`
2. Add this snippet:

```yml
collect:

    title="Step 3. Forward your ActiveMQ logs"
  >
With your monitoring environment set up, forward your ActiveMQ logs to New Relic. To forward logs:

1. Go to your ActiveMQ `logging.yml` file.
2. Add this snippet anywhere to the file:

```yml
- name: activemq.log
  file: /opt/activemq/data/activemq.log
  attributes:
    logtype: activemq-log
- name: activemq_audit.log
  file: /opt/activemq/data/activemq.log
  attributes:
    logtype: activemq-audit-log
```

After you're done installing, you can find your dashboards by going to the **Dashboards** tab in the top nav.
