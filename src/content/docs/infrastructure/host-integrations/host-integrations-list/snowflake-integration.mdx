Our Snowflake integration empowers you to gather comprehensive data on various aspects, including query performance, storage system health, warehouse status, and billing information.

<Steps>
    <Step>

    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

    To use the Snowflake integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Snowflake-specific data.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ## Setup Snowflake metrics

    Run the below command to store Snowflake metrics in JSON formate, allowing nri-flex to read it. Ensure to modify the `ACCOUNT`, `USERNAME`, and `SNOWSQL_PWD` accordingly.

    ```shell
    # Run the below command as a 1 minute cronjob

    ## Enable Snowflake integration with nri-flex

    To set up the Snowflake integration, follow these steps:

    1. Create a file named `nri-snowflake-config.yml` in the integrations directory:

    ```shell
    touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-snowflake-config.yml
    ```

    2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-snowflake-config.yml` file to enable the agent to capture Snowflake data:

    ```yml

    ```

    </Step>

    <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

    Restart your infrastructure agent. 

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ## Find your data 

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Snowflake` to monitor your Snowflake application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DNT>**+ Add data**</DNT> page.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards.**</DNT>
    3. In the search bar, type `Snowflake`.
    4. The Snowflake dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it

    Your Snowflake dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

    Here is a NRQL query to check the Snowflake metrics:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM snowflakeAccountSample
    ```        
    </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next?

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards, check out these docs:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
