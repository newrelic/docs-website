With our Snowflake dashboards, you can easily track query performance and logins, monitor your Snowflake warehouses, and get a total overview of the health of your storage system, like potential security incidents. Built with our infrastructure agent and our Snowflake integration, Snowflake dashboards let you view your most critical query data, all in one place.

After setting up the Snowflake integration with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

Before getting Snowflake data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent. This allows New Relic to collect data from Snowflake so performance metrics, logins, and other data appear in dashboards. 

There are two methods to install the infrastructure agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=8f14e646-461e-b010-4675-3a0658bb3d20) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. 
* [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.

## Integrate Snowflake with New Relic [#integrate]

The following instructions walk you through Snowflake integration with New Relic. The information for installation is split between this doc and the New Relic Snowflake repo, which you'll go to in step 4. 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="step1"
    title="Step 1. Clone the Snowflake repository"
    >
    Run the following command in your CLI to clone the New Relic Snowflake repo into your machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration.git
    ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
    id="step2"
    title="Step 2. Download relevant binary for your platform"
    >
In the cloned repo from step 1, download the [relevant binary](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/releases) in the `releases` section. In other words, if you're running Linux, then you'd download `snowflakeintegration-linux.` 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
    id="step3"
    title="Step 3. Update `config.yaml`"
    >
To ensure that you're using the most up to date information for the integration, update your `config.yaml` file to match the snippet found in [Key Pair authentication](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration#key-pair-authentication) in the Snowflake repo. 

Once you've updated the yaml file, return to this doc to install the dashboards to your New Relic account.

## Create custom queries [#custom]

You can send your own customized metrics to New Relic. Once you've added these custom queries, you can monitor them on a dashboard.

Below are two examples of custom queries.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="longest"
        title="Longest queries"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `longest_queries.sql` 
    2. Designate the file path as `newrelic-snowflake-integrations/queries`.
    3. In `longest_queries.sql`, add the following snippet:

    ```sql
    select 
        query_id, 
        query_text,
        (execution_time / 60000) as exec_time,
        warehouse_name,
        user_name,
        execution_status
    from 
        snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
    where 
        execution_status = 'SUCCESS' 
    order by 
        execution_time desc
    ```
    4. In the `flex-snowflake-linux.yml` file, add the following snippet:
    
```yml
- name: longestQueries
entity: snowflake
# New Relic will capture all your Snowflake metrics when you use `event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`. 
event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
custom_attributes:
    metric_type: snowflake.query_performance
commands: 
    - run: - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/longest_queries.sql
```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="warehouse-usage"
        title="Credit usage by warehouse"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql` 
    2. Designate the file path as `YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.
    3. In `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`, add the following snippet:

    ```sql
    select 
        warehouse_name, 
        sum(credits_used) as total_credits_used 
    from 
        snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history 
    group by 
        1 
    order by 
        2 desc;
    ```
    4. Add the following snippet to `flex-snowflake.yml`:

    ```yml
        - name: CreditUsageByWarehouse
            entity: snowflake
            event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
            custom_attributes:
                metric_type: snowflake.credit_usage_by_warehouse
            commands: 
            - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql
    ``` 
    </Collapser>

## Get Snowflake metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

Once you've installed the [Snowflake quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/snowflake), you can see your critical Snowflake data in New Relic. 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Metrics & events**.
2. Run either NRQL queries to view your Snowflake metrics: `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeAccount` or `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Snowflake metrics, go to **Dashboards** from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** to see your Snowflake dashboards. 

## What's next?

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards, check out these docs:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your dashboards display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
