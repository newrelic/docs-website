Our Snowflake integration lets you collect data about query performance, or about the health of your storage systems and warehouses. The integration then presents this data in a set of pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" />, letting you view your most critical query data all in one place.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This integration falls under the **Community project** designation in our [Open Source categories](https://opensource.newrelic.com/oss-category). This code is developed in the open with input from the community through issues and PRs. There is an active maintainer team within New Relic, as well as troubleshooting support in the New Relic Explorers Hub and documentation available in the project repository.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To see your Snowflake data in New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent collects data from Snowflake and sends that data to New Relic, where you can use performance metrics dashboards to keep track of how your Snowflake storage system is doing. 

Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=8f14e646-461e-b010-4675-3a0658bb3d20) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent.

## Integrate Snowflake with New Relic [#integrate]

Follow these procedures to enable the infrastructure agent to capture data from your Snowflake app:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="step1"
    title="Step 1. Clone the Snowflake repository"
    >
    Run the following command in your CLI to clone the New Relic Snowflake repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration.git
    ```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="step2"
    title="Step 2. Download relevant binary for your platform"
    >
From the `releases` section, download the [`snowflakeintegration-linux`
binary](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/releases). Place that binary in the cloned repo.

Make sure the binary is executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x snowflakeintegration-linux
```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="step3"
    title={<>Step 3. Update the <InlineCode>config.yaml</InlineCode> file</>}
    >
To ensure you're using the most recent information for the integration, update your `config.yaml` file so that the file matches the snippet found in Snowflake's [Key Pair authentication](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration#key-pair-authentication) section. 
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="step4"
    title={<>Step 4. When the agent is running as a <InlineCode>systemd</InlineCode> service</>}
    >      
If the New Relic infrastructure agent runs as a `systemd` service, follow these [steps to set the environment variable](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration#when-the-agent-is-running-as-a-systemd-service). (Skip this step if you're not running the New Relic infrastructure agent as a `systemd` service and follow the Step 5).      
* To determine if you're on a system using `systemd` as the init service, run the following:

```bash
[[ `\systemctl` =~ -\.mount ]] && echo yes || echo no 
```  
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
    id="step5"
    title={<>Step 5. Setting <InlineCode>NEWRELIC_SNOWFLAKE_HOME</InlineCode> variable</>}
    >
Set the `NEWRELIC_SNOWFLAKE_HOME` environment variable as documented in the [Setting NEWRELIC_SNOWFLAKE_HOME](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/tree/main#setting-newrelic_snowflake_home) section. (Skip this step if you're running the New Relic infrastructure agent as a `systemd` service and follow the Step 4).
    </Collapser> 
    <Collapser
    id="step6"
    title={<>Step 6. Update <InlineCode>flex config</InlineCode> </>}
    >
Copy the relevant flex config for your platform from [flexConfigs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/tree/main/flexConfigs) to the agent's `integrations.d` folder:
* for Linux, find it at `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/`
* for Windows, find it at `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Once you've followed all these steps, return to this doc to install the dashboard to your New Relic account.

## Create custom queries [#custom]

You can send your own customized metrics to New Relic and view that data in a dashboard. Below are two examples of custom queries.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="longest"
        title="Longest queries"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `longest_queries.sql` 
    2. Designate the file path as `newrelic-snowflake-integrations/queries`.
    3. In `longest_queries.sql`, add the following snippet:

    ```sql
    select 
        query_id, 
        query_text,
        (execution_time / 60000) as exec_time,
        warehouse_name,
        user_name,
        execution_status
    from 
        snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
    where 
        execution_status = 'SUCCESS' 
    order by 
        execution_time desc
    ```
    4. In the `flex-snowflake-linux.yml` file, add the following snippet:
    
```yml
- name: longestQueries
entity: snowflake
# New Relic will capture all your Snowflake metrics when you use `event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`. 
event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
custom_attributes:
    metric_type: snowflake.query_performance
commands: 
    - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/longest_queries.sql
```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="warehouse-usage"
        title="Credit usage by warehouse"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql` 
    2. Designate the file path as `YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.
    3. In `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`, add the following snippet:

    ```sql
    select 
        warehouse_name, 
        sum(credits_used) as total_credits_used 
    from 
        snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history 
    group by 
        1 
    order by 
        2 desc;
    ```
    4. Add the following snippet to `flex-snowflake.yml`:

    ```yml
        - name: CreditUsageByWarehouse
            entity: snowflake
            event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
            custom_attributes:
                metric_type: snowflake.credit_usage_by_warehouse
            commands: 
            - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql
    ``` 
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## See Snowflake metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

Once you've installed the [Snowflake quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/snowflake), you can see your critical Snowflake data in New Relic. 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Metrics & events**.
2. Run either NRQL queries to view your Snowflake metrics: `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeAccount` or `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Snowflake metrics, go to **Dashboards** from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** to see your Snowflake dashboards. 

## What's next?
