With our Nextcloud dashboard, you can easily track the number of files in your system, your user accounts, and your database size. Built with our infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, the Nextcloud integration gives you a set of default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> that let you view your most critical data all in one place.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your app’s performance.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

## Configure NRI-Flex for Nextcloud [#integrate]

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

Metrics for Nextcloud are available at the following URL: `http://<YOUR_HOST_IP>/ocs/v2.php/apps/serverinfo/api/v1/info?format=json`

1. Create a file named `nri-flex-nextcloud.yml` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`

2. Use our [configuration template](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/examples/json-read-cmd-example.yml) to update the fields `EVENT_TYPE` and `YOUR_DOMAIN` in the file named `nri-flex-nextcloud.yml`. The value on the `event_type` is used to store metrics on the NRDB. For example, you can update `EVENT_TYPE` to `NextcloudFlexMetrics`

Your `nri-flex-nextcloud.yml` file should look like this:

  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      config:
        name: nextcloudFlex
        global:
          base_url: http://<YOUR_HOST_IP>/ocs/v2.php/apps/serverinfo/api/v1/
          user: <nextcloud_username>
          pass: <nextcloud_password>
        apis:
          - event_type: EVENT_TYPE
            url: info?format=json
  ```

## Forward Nextcloud logs to New Relic

You can use [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Nextcloud logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be placed in `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`

After creating the log file, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
logs:
  - name: nextcloud.log
    file: /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log
    attributes:
      logtype: nextcloud_log
```

## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

1. Before you can start using your data, [restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/).

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```
2. Install the [Nextcloud quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/nextcloud) to get our pre-built dashboards.

##  Find your data

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Nextcloud` to monitor your Nextcloud server metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DoNotTranslate>**+ Add data**</DoNotTranslate> page. 
2. Click on <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. In the search bar, type `Nextcloud`. 
4. The Nextcloud dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Nextcloud dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Use this sample query to view your Nextcloud metrics captured on <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DoNotTranslate>:

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users for the last 5 minutes:
  ```sql
  FROM NextcloudFlexMetrics SELECT latest(ocs.data.activeUsers.last5minutes)
  ```

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users in the last 24 hours:
  ```sql
  FROM NextcloudFlexMetrics SELECT latest(ocs.data.activeUsers.last24hours)
  ```

* Read our [introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* See how to [manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
