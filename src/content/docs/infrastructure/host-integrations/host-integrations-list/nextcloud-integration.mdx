With our Nextcloud dashboard, you can easily track the number of files in your system, your user accounts, and your database size. Built with our infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, the Nextcloud integration gives you a set of default dashboards that let you view your most critical data all in one place.

**Prerequisites**

To get your Nextcloud data in New Relic, you need to:

* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
* Use Nextcloud 22 or later.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your app’s performance.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you’d rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

## Export Nextcloud data [#export]

To start the integration process, you need to export your Nextcloud metrics with `nextcloud-exporter`. This eventually allows our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to ingest data into New Relic. After you've exposed your metrics, you need to complete token authentication.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="export"
    title="Export your Nextcloud data"
  >
1. Run the following Docker commands to access `nextcloud-exporter`:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
docker pull xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
```

2. Clone `nextcloud-exporter`:

```
git clone https://github.com/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter.git
cd nextcloud-exporter
```

3. Using `make`, create a binary file in the `nextcloud-exporter` folder named `nextcloud-exporter`.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="token"
    title="Complete token authentication"
  >

1. To authenticate your token, you need to generate random value using OpenSSL:

```
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
``` 

2. Set the token using the occ command by going to `/var/www/nextcloud`:

```
occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value "$TOKEN"
```

3. From your cloned Nextcloud folder, run the following command to initiate username and password authentication:

```
./nextcloud-exporter --login <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1
```
4. To access metrics for Nextcloud, run:

```
./nextcloud-exporter -u <YOUR_USERNAME> -p <YOUR_PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1:9205
```

5. From your browser, go to `http:127.0.0.1:9205/metrics` to view your metrics.

## Integrate Prometheus OpenMetrics with Nextcloud [#prometheus]

With the infrastructure agent installed, you need to establish a line of communication between Nextcloud and New Relic with our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Prometheus OpenMetrics scrapes your exposed Nextcloud data so they appear in our prebuilt dashboards.

1. Follow our instructions to install our [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration). 
2. Update the `nri-prometheus.config.yml` file to match our snippet in the [`nri-prometheus` repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample).
3. To get server-related information, replace the URL inside the targets. The replacement URL should match the URL associated with your exposed Nextcloud metrics:

```yml
targets:
  urls: ["http://127.0.0.1:9205"]
```
5. Follow our doc to [restart your New Relic infrastructure service](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent).
6. Install the [Nextcloud quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/nextcloud) to get your pre-built dashboards.
