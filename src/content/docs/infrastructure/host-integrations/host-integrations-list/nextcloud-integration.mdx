With our Nextcloud dashboard, you can easily track the number of files in your system, your user accounts, and your database size. Built with our infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, the Nextcloud integration gives you a set of default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> that let you view your most critical data all in one place.

## Prerequisites

To get your Nextcloud data in New Relic, you need to:

* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* Install the `make` command
* Use Nextcloud 22 or later

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your appâ€™s performance.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

## Export Nextcloud data [#export]

To start the integration process, you need to export your Nextcloud metrics with `nextcloud-exporter`. This eventually allows our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to ingest data into New Relic. After you've exposed your metrics, you need to complete token authentication.

    title="Export your Nextcloud data"
  >
  1. Run the following Docker commands to access `nextcloud-exporter`:
    ```shell
    docker pull ghcr.io/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
    docker pull xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
    ```

  2. Clone `nextcloud-exporter`:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter.git
    ```

  3. In your `nextcloud-exporter` folder, create a binary file by using the `make` command:
    ```shell
    make
    ```
    You'll find a binary file named `nextcloud-exporter` inside your `nextcloud-exporter` folder.
  </Collapser>

  >

    1. To authenticate your token, login to Nextcloud and go to **Personal Setting**, and from the left hand-side menu, click **Security**.
    2. Under **Devices & Sessions**, enter an app name and click **Create New App Password**.
    3. Copy the token to use it in `nextcloud-exporter` configuration. You'll need the token later.
    4. Go to your local Nextcloud path, for example `/var/www/html/nextcloud`, and set the token by running:
      ```shell
      sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value "YOUR_TOKEN"
      ```
    5. In your `nextcloud-exporter` folder, run the following command to authenticate yourself:
      ```shell
      ./nextcloud-exporter --login YOUR_USERNAME YOUR_PASSWORD --server http://127.0.0.1/nextcloud
      ```

      This command will output a URL, copy it and paste it in your browser.
    6. Click **Log in**, grant access, and you'll see the `Account connected` message. Now you'll receive a username with an encrypted password on the terminal.

    7. To access your Nextcloud metrics, run the following command from your local `nextcloud-exporter` folder:
      ```shell
      ./nextcloud-exporter -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD --server http://127.0.0.1/nextcloud
      ```

    8. From your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:9205/metrics` to view your metrics.

## Integrate Prometheus OpenMetrics with Nextcloud [#prometheus]

With the infrastructure agent installed, you need to establish a line of communication between Nextcloud and New Relic with our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Prometheus OpenMetrics scrapes your exposed Nextcloud data so they appear in our prebuilt dashboards.

1. Follow our instructions to install our [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration). 
2. Navigate to `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`, the folder you installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in, and create a file named `nri-prometheus.config.yml`.
3. Copy the contents of the [`nri-prometheus.config.yml` sample file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample), and paste them in your `nri-prometheus.config.yml` file. To get server-related information, replace the URL value inside the `targets` key. The URL should match the URL associated with your exposed Nextcloud metrics:
  ```yml
    integrations:
    - name: nri-prometheus
      config:
        # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
        standalone: false

        # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
        emitters: infra-sdk

        # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
        cluster_name: "my_exporter"

        targets:
          - description: Secure etcd example
            urls: ["http://127.0.0.1:9205"]
        #    tls_config:
        #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
        #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
        #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

        # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false.
        verbose: false

        # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
        # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
        # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care.
        audit: false

        # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to "5s" if it is not set.
        # scrape_timeout: "5s"

        # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints. Default to "30s" if it is not set.
        scrape_duration: "5s"

        # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
        # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
        # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
        # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
        # many metrics are being scraped.
        # Default: 4
        # worker_threads: 4

        # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false.
        insecure_skip_verify: false

      timeout: 10s
  ```
    
4. [Restart your New Relic infrastructure service](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent).
5. Install the [Nextcloud quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/nextcloud) to get our pre-built dashboards.
    
## Query your data using NRQL

Use this sample query to view your Lighttpd metrics captured on **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**:

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users for the last 5 minutes:
  ```sql
  SELECT latest(nextcloud_active_users_total) FROM Metric
  ```

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users in the last 24 hours:
  ```sql
  SELECT latest(nextcloud_active_users_daily_total) FROM Metric
  ```

## What's next?

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards:

* Read our [introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* Read our [introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* See how to [manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard. 
    
## Troubleshooting
    
### Problem

Every time you open a page in Nextcloud, you see this error message:

```shell
Invalid private key for encryption app. Please update your private key password in your personal settings to recover access to your encrypted files.
```

### Solution
    
1. Check the status of the Nextcloud encryption by running:
  ```shell
  sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:status
  ```
    
2. If you see `enabled: false`, enable the encryption by running:
  ```shell
  sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:enable
  ```
    
3. Verify that the encryption is enabled by running:
  ```shell
  sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:status
  ```
    
Now, exit Nextcloud and refresh your Nextcloud browser session. You shouldn't see the error message anymore.
