Monitor your Stripe application in a single, pre-built Stripe dashboard that tracks metrics like transaction overview, transaction volume, revenue, and transaction errors. Simply install our agents to collect your app data, and you'll be able to see all of your Stripe app data in one place.

## Set up Stripe monitoring

<Steps>
  <Step>
        ### Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

Install our infrastructure agent to get details about your host, such as CPU usage, memory usage, storage usage, network traffic, and more.

To install the agent, follow the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=999174fa-ed8b-d707-af7b-8e4f8fd03cc1) or see the [Infrastructure agent installation docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/) to install manually.  

    </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install an APM agent [#apm-setup]

Install one of our application performance monitoring (APM) agents in the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=999174fa-ed8b-d707-af7b-8e4f8fd03cc1).
    </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install our browser monitoring agent [#browser-setup]

Our <InlinePopover type="browser" /> agent reports application and browser-related metrics like AJAX performance, error rate, duration, core web vitals, and throughput.
* See [Install the browser monitoring agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/) to get started.
    </Step>

    <Step>
      ### Set up synthetic monitoring [#synthetic-setup]

Our synthetic monitors test your app in different locations and capture server downtime. You can view this data in the Stripe dashboard.

To set up synthetic monitors, follow the steps in our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0EjOXrnxgQ6)
  </Step>

    <Step>
### Send metrics to New Relic [#send-metrics]

Check the [Metric API documentation](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/report-metrics-metric-api/) for further details.

To proceed further, you will need a New Relic license key. See [New Relic API Keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) to get your license key.
On a successful stripe payment, we receive a JSON from the stripe API service. We need to send these values to New Relic by formatting the JSON as per New Relic Metric API requirements.

The following JavaScript code snippet formats the data and sends it to the New Relic metric API URL: 

```javascript
const sendDataToNewRelic = (sessionJSON) => {
  const currentDate = new Date();
  const currentTime = currentDate.getTime();
  const nrMetrics = [{
    "metrics": [
      {
        "name": "stripe_metrics",
        "timestamp": currentTime,
        "value": 0,
        "attributes": {
          "stripe.session_id": sessionJSON.id,
          "stripe.amount_total": sessionJSON.amount_total,
          "stripe.customer_email": sessionJSON.customer_details.email,
          "stripe.created_at": sessionJSON.created,
          "stripe.currency" : sessionJSON.currency,
          "stripe.payment_status": sessionJSON.payment_status,
          "stripe.status": sessionJSON.status,
          "stripe.discount_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_discount,
          "stripe.shipping_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_shipping,
          "stripe.tax_amount":sessionJSON.total_details.amount_tax
        }
      }
    ]
  }]

  const nrMetricAPI = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1'
  axios({
    url: nrMetricAPI,
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Api-Key': 'LICENSE_KEY'
     },
    data: JSON.stringify(nrMetrics)
  })
   .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response here if needed
    console.log('Metrics data sent successfully:', response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the request
    console.error('Error sending metrics data to New Relic:', error);
  })
}

```

**Note:** Change the `sessionJSON` according to your response and call this function where you are getting Stripe metrics in your application.

```javascript
 sendDataToNewRelic (session)
```

      </Step>

  <Step>
### Install our Stripe monitoring dashboard [#add-dashboard]

To set up our pre-built Stripe dashboard to monitor your application metrics, go to the [Stripe dashboard installation](https://onenr.io/0ZQWYYE1rRW) and follow the instructions. Once installed, the dashboard should display metrics.
    </Step>
    </Steps>


## What's next?

Use NRQL to query your Stripe app data. For example, if you want to view net revenue obtained from Stripe, try this query in the Query Finder:

```sql
SELECT stripe.amount_total FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'stripe_metrics'
```

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards, check out these docs:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
