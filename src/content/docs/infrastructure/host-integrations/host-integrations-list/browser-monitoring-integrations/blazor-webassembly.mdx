With our Blazor WebAssembly dashboard, you can easily monitor your golden metrics, track end user experience, and see your total page views over time. 

Built with our browser monitoring agent, the Blazor WebAssembly integration gives you a set of default dashboards that let you view your most critical query data, all in one place.

After setting up the Blazor WebAssembly integration with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

You don't need the infrastructure agent to integrate Blazor WebAssembly with New Relic, but we recommend installation if you want full observability of your system. The infrastructure agent collects logs and other data about your hosts, showing your performance metrics alongside your application metrics. 

There are two methods to install the infrastructure agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/catalog-pack-details.launcher/?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyJ9) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. 

## Integrate Blazor WebAssembly with New Relic [#integrate]

To collect data from Blazor WebAssembly, follow the below procedures: 

1. Install the [browser monitoring agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent).
2. Go to the `www/root` directory once you've opened your app. Add the script from the browser agent installation to the `index.html` file.
3. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Metrics & events**. Run a sample NRQL query to confirm New Relic is collecting data: 

```sql
SELECT average(windowLoad) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (deviceType = 'Desktop') FACET `userAgentName` SINCE 604800 seconds AGO TIMESERIES
```
4. Install the default dashboards by going to the [Blazor WebAssembly instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/blazor-web-assembly), then clicking **Install** at the top of the page. 
5. Go to **Dashboards** from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** and click Blazor WebAssembly to view your dashboards.
