Our JMX [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#comp-req]

Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in `PATH`, follow [New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/nrjmx#configuring-java-version).

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* If JMX is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* This integration does not support the IIOP protocol.

## Install and activate [#install]

To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

    1. Install [the infrastructure agent](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations/#install), and replace the `INTEGRATION_FILE_NAME` variable with `nri-jmx`.
    2. Change the directory to the integrations folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml
       ```
    4. Copy the JVM configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml
       ```
    5. **Optional**: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file:

       ```
       sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml
       ```
    6. Edit the `jmx-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    7. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

       <Callout variant="important">
         If the sample files are not present in your installation, you can download them directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-jmx).
       </Callout>

    1. Download the `nri-jmx` .MSI installer image from:

       [http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi](http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi)
    2. To install from the Windows command prompt, run:

       ```
       msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\TO\nri-jmx-amd64.msi
       ```
    3. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

       ```
       cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `jmx-config.yml` configuration file using the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* When the Infrastructure agent executes the `nri-jmx` binary, it sets the path to `PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin`. The java binary must be in one of those paths.
* `nrjmx` and `jmx` need java binaries to be in the system `PATH`, which is NOT the `PATH` for the root user, and isn't affected if you change the `PATH` environment variable in `/root/.bashrc`. Read more on how to [change the PATH system variable](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Tips for naming your data [#data-naming]

Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an [event](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) in our database.

You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme:

* Use camel case.
* Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains.

Example: `MyorgApplicationSample`

**Recommendation:** Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

JMX data is attached to the user-defined [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic) specified in the [configuration file](#metrics-collection). For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an `event_type` called `TomcatSample`, and [query that event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the [MBean](https://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/index.jsp?topic=/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/JMX_MBean_Query_for_JVMs.html) they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in [NRQL queries](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans.

Each event contains the following metadata:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "180px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `displayName`
      </td>

      <td>
        The JMX domain name for these metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `entityName`
      </td>

      <td>
        The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `host`
      </td>

      <td>
        The JMX host the metrics are being collected from.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `query`
      </td>

      <td>
        The query used to collect these metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `bean`
      </td>

      <td>
        The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `key:<mbean_key>`
      </td>

      <td>
        For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called `“key:<mbean_key>` with the value of the bean’s key.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Example NRQL query

Here's an example [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors:

```
SELECT latest(CollectionTime)
FROM JVMSample
FACET `key:name`
WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector'
```

### Metrics data attributes [#metrics-attributes]

The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `HeapMemoryUsage.Used`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total Java heap memory used.

        The number of live threads.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `CollectionCount`

    If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the [log file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generate-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) for this message:

    ```
    "Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported."
    ```

    If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain.
