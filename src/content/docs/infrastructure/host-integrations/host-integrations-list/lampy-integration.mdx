Our LAMPy integration makes use of the Infrastructure agent, MySQL agent, Apache agent, and Python agent to provide you with a pre-built dashboard with your most important metrics (like response time, CPU utilization, traffic, and login frequencies)

## Install [#install]

### Step 1: Install the infrastructure agent for Linux [#infra-install]

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) for the host containing your Flutter app.

### Step 1: Install the MySQL agent [#mysql-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the MySQL agent to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [MySQL docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/mysql/).

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data ** > Infrastructure & OS  > MySQL**.
2. 

### Step 1: Install the Apache agent [#apache-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the Apache agent to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [Apache docs](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-monitoring-integration/).

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data ** > Infrastructure & OS  > MySQL**.
2. 

### Step 1: Install the Python agent [#python-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the Python agent to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [Python docs](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/)

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data ** > Application monitoring  > Python**.
2. Name your application.
3. Download the configuration file and place it in your application's root directory.
4. Integrate python agent for Django web site which is running on Apache server 
5. Update the wsgi.py and settings.py files
```
	settings.py
```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE = BASE_DIR / `downloaded_newrelic_file`
	```

```
wsgi.py
```
      import newrelic.agent

      from django.conf import settings 
      from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

      application = get_wsgi_application()

      newrelic.agent.initialize(settings.NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE)
      newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application)
```
8. Restart your Apache server. 

Wait five minutes and then proceed to finding your data in New Relic. 


## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your LAMPy dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `LAMPy`. 
4. The Flutter dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your LAMPy dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query checking the average window load time for the various browsers used by users on desktop computers: 

```
SELECT (average(`apache.server.net.bytesPerSecond`) 
AVERAGE (`apache.server.net.requestsPerSecond`)) as 'Bytes sent per request' 
FROM Metric 
TIMESERIES auto
```
