Our LAMPy integration makes use of the infrastructure agent, MySQL integration, Apache integration, and Python agent to provide you with a pre-built dashboard with your most important metrics like response time, CPU utilization, traffic, and login frequencies.

After setting up our LAMPy integration, we give you a dashboard for your LAMPy web app metrics.

## Step 1: Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) for the host containing your LAMPy application.

## Step 2: Install the MySQL integration [#mysql-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the MySQL integration to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [MySQL docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/mysql/).

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data > Infrastructure & OS  > MySQL**.
2. Follow the instructions to install the MySQL agent.

## Step 3: Install the Apache integration [#apache-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the Apache integration to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [Apache docs](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-monitoring-integration/).

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data > Infrastructure & OS  > Apache**.
2. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Apache agent.

## Step 4: Install the Python agent [#python-install]

Our LAMPy integration relies on the Python agent to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [Python docs](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/).

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) click **Add data > Application monitoring  > Python**.
2. Name your application.
3. Download the configuration file and place it in your application's root directory.
4. Integrate your python agent that is connected to Django web site. This python agent also runs on the Apache server. 
5. Add this line to your `settings.py` file:

```py
  NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE = BASE_DIR / 'newrelic.ini'
```

6. Add these lines to your `wsgi.py` file:

```py
import newrelic.agent

from django.conf import settings 
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

application = get_wsgi_application()

newrelic.agent.initialize(settings.NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE)
newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application)

```
## Step 5: Restart your Apache server

Wait for a few minutes and then proceed to finding your data in New Relic. 


## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your LAMPy dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `LAMPy`. 
4. The LAMPy dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your LAMPy dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

For information about data reported, see the docs for each of the tools you installed:

*  [Linux data](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux/)
* [MySQL data](https://docs.newrelic.com/install/mysql/#metrics)
* [Apache data](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-monitoring-integration/)
* [Python data](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/)

If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here is an example NRQL query to check bytes sent per request:

```sql
SELECT (average(`apache.server.net.bytesPerSecond`) / average(`apache.server.net.requestsPerSecond`)) as 'Bytes sent per request' 
FROM Metric 
TIMESERIES auto
```
