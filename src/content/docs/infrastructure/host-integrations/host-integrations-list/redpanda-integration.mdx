Our RedPanda integration captures cluster-level metrics, data about scheduling groups, and details about your service errors and uptime, then displays that data in a pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/>.

  After setting up Redpanda with New Relic, your data will display in a dashboard, right out of the box.

Complete the following steps to install the integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

    To use the RedPanda integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with RedPanda-specific data.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure integration [#configure]

    1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`.
    2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to enable the capture of RedPanda data. Be sure to edit the config file with your info:

       ```yml
       integrations:
         - name: nri-prometheus
           config:
             # When standalone is set to false, nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
             standalone: false

             # If using the infrastructure agent, emitters have to include infra-sdk
             emitters: infra-sdk

             # The name of your cluster. The name of your cluster must be consistent across New Relic products so the infrastructure agent and nri-prometheus can scrape data from the cluster.
             cluster_name: "YOUR_EXPORTER_NAME"

             targets:
               - description: Redpanda metrics are captured in the below urls
                 urls: ["http://localhost:9644/metrics", "http://localhost:9644/public_metrics"]
             #    tls_config:
             #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
             #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
             #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

             # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode. Defaults to false.
             verbose: false

             # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in audit mode. Defaults to false.
             # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
             # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care.
             audit: false

             # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to "5s" if it's not set.
             # scrape_timeout: "5s"

             # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints. Default to "30s" if it's not set.
             scrape_duration: "5s"

             # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
             # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
             # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
             # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
             # many metrics are being scraped.
             # Default: 4
             # worker_threads: 4

             #Specifies whether or not the integration should skip TLS verification. Defaults to false.
             insecure_skip_verify: false

           timeout: 10s
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

    Before you can start using your data, [restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/).

    The following command should work for most systems:

    ````shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```        

    ````
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#redpanda-metrics]

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `RedPanda` to monitor your Nextcloud server metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DNT>**+ Integrations & Agents**</DNT> page.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>.
    3. In the search bar, type `RedPanda`.
    4. The RedPanda dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

    Your Nextcloud dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).  

  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next? [#whats-next]

If you want to customize your RedPanda dashboards, you can learn more about building NRQL queries and managing your dashboards in the New Relic UI:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your dashboard display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
