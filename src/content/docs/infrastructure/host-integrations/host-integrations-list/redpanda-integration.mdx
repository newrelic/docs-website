With our Redpanda dashboard, you can track your cluster-level metrics, Redpanda scheduling groups, and your service errors and uptime. Built with our infrastructure agent and our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, our Redpanda dashboard take advantage of OpenMetrics endpoint scraping, so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up Redpanda with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration [#install]

Before getting Redpanda data into New Relic, you'll need to install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing Prometheus OpenMetrics. 

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=5e236fa2-fbfd-1f53-e55d-9241d2a73068) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. You can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.
* Install our [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration).

## Configure Prometheus OpenMetrics for RedPanda [#configure]

After you've installed Prometheus OpenMetrics, you need to configure the `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to scrape for RedPanda data. Your configuration file should match our snippet in the [nri-prometheus](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) repository: 

```yml
integrations:
- name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      # When standalone is set to false, the infrastructure agent will need to send data so nri-prometheus can work. Defaults to true.
      standalone: false

      # If using the infrastructure agent, emitters must be set to infra-sdk
      emitters: infra-sdk

      # The name of your cluster. The name of your cluster must be consistent across New Relic products so the infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics can scrape data from the cluster.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_EXPORTER_NAME"

      targets:
        - description: "Redpanda metrics are captured in the below urls"
          urls: ["'localhost:9644/metrics', 'localhost:9644/public_metrics']
      # tls_config:
      # ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      # cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      # key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

      # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode. Defaults to false.
      verbose: false

      # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in audit mode. Defaults to false.
      # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
      # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, so use with care.
      audit: false

      # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
      # scrape_timeout: "30s"

      # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints.
      scrape_duration: "5s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with more than 400 endpoints, we recommend that you slowly increase until scrape time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Specifies whether or not the integration should skip TLS verification. Defaults to false.
      insecure_skip_verify: false

    timeout: 10s
```

## Get RedPanda metrics as a dashboard

Once you've installed the [Redpanda quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/redpanda), you can see your critical Redpanda data in New Relic. To confirm that your data is reporting:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities), then click **Metrics & events**.
2. Run the following NRQL query: `FROM Metric SELECT latest(vectorized_application_uptime)`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Redpanda metrics, go to **Dashboards** from [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) to see your RedPanda dashboard.

If you want to further customize your RedPanda dashboards, you can learn more about building NRQL queries and managing your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> in the New Relic UI:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
