With our Redpanda dashboard, you can track your cluster-level metrics, Redpanda scheduling groups, and your service errors and uptime. Built with our infrastructure agent and our nri-prometheus integration, our Redpanda dashboard takes advantage of nri-prometheus endpoint scraping, so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up Redpanda with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent

Before getting Redpanda data into New Relic, you'll need to install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by configuring nri-prometheus. 

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=5e236fa2-fbfd-1f53-e55d-9241d2a73068) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. You can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.

## Configure nri-prometheus for RedPanda [#configure]
1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`.
2. Add the following configuration to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to scrape for RedPanda data. Your configuration file should match our snippet in the [nri-prometheus](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) repository: 
```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      # When standalone is set to false, nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
      standalone: false

      # If using the infrastructure agent, emitters have to include infra-sdk
      emitters: infra-sdk


      # The name of your cluster. The name of your cluster must be consistent across New Relic products so the infrastructure agent and nri-prometheus can scrape data from the cluster.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_EXPORTER_NAME"

      targets:
        - description: Redpanda metrics are captured in the below urls
          urls: ["http://localhost:9644/metrics", "http://localhost:9644/public_metrics"]
      #    tls_config:
      #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

      # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode. Defaults to false.
      verbose: false

      # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in audit mode. Defaults to false.
      # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
      # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care.
      audit: false

      # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to "5s" if it's not set.
      # scrape_timeout: "5s"

      # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints. Default to "30s" if it's not set.
      scrape_duration: "5s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      #Specifies whether or not the integration should skip TLS verification. Defaults to false.
      insecure_skip_verify: false

    timeout: 10s
  ```

## Get RedPanda metrics as a dashboard

Once you've installed the [Redpanda quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/redpanda), you can see your critical Redpanda data in New Relic. To confirm that your data is reporting:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities), then click **Metrics & events**.
2. Run the following NRQL query: `FROM Metric SELECT latest(vectorized_application_uptime)`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Redpanda metrics, go to **Dashboards** from [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) to see your RedPanda dashboard.

If you want to further customize your RedPanda dashboards, you can learn more about building NRQL queries and managing your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> in the New Relic UI:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
