Our RedPanda integration captures cluster-level metrics, data about scheduling groups, and details about your service errors and uptime, then displays that data in a pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" />.

After setting up Redpanda with New Relic, your data will display in a dashboard, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install-agent]

Before getting Redpanda data into New Relic, you need to install our infrastructure agent, then configure `nri-prometheus` to scrape data. 

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=5e236fa2-fbfd-1f53-e55d-9241d2a73068) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. You can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.

## Configure `nri-prometheus` for RedPanda [#configure]

1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`.
2. Add a snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file that enables the agent to capture RedPanda data. Your configuration file should match our snippet in the [nri-prometheus](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) repository: 

  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-prometheus
      config:
        # When standalone is set to false, nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
        standalone: false

        # If using the infrastructure agent, emitters have to include infra-sdk
        emitters: infra-sdk


        # The name of your cluster. The name of your cluster must be consistent across New Relic products so the infrastructure agent and nri-prometheus can scrape data from the cluster.
        cluster_name: "YOUR_EXPORTER_NAME"

        targets:
          - description: Redpanda metrics are captured in the below urls
            urls: ["http://localhost:9644/metrics", "http://localhost:9644/public_metrics"]
        #    tls_config:
        #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
        #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
        #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

        # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode. Defaults to false.
        verbose: false

        # Specifies whether or not the integration should run in audit mode. Defaults to false.
        # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
        # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care.
        audit: false

        # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to "5s" if it's not set.
        # scrape_timeout: "5s"

        # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints. Default to "30s" if it's not set.
        scrape_duration: "5s"

        # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
        # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
        # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
        # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
        # many metrics are being scraped.
        # Default: 4
        # worker_threads: 4

        #Specifies whether or not the integration should skip TLS verification. Defaults to false.
        insecure_skip_verify: false

      timeout: 10s
    ```

## Get RedPanda metrics as a dashboard [#redpanda-metrics]

To confirm that your data is reporting:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities), then click <DoNotTranslate>**Metrics & events**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Run the following NRQL query: `FROM Metric SELECT latest(vectorized_application_uptime)`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Redpanda metrics, go to <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> from [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) to see your RedPanda dashboard.

If you want to customize your RedPanda dashboards, you can learn more about building NRQL queries and managing your dashboards in the New Relic UI:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your dashboard display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
