Our port monitoring integration monitors status for networking ports, such as TCP, UDP, etc., and reports uptime and outage data to New Relic.

## Install the integration [#install]

Follow the steps below to install the integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

    To use the Port Monitoring integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. All our on-host integrations require the infrastructure agent, which helps expose and report metrics to New Relic.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Download and prepare the integration [#download]

    1. Download and unpack the tar file from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-port-monitor/releases):

       ```shell
       wget https://github.com/newrelic/nri-port-monitor/releases/download/1.3/nri-port-monitor.tar.gz && tar -zxvf nri-port-monitor.tar.gz  
       ```

    2. Copy the `bin` directory with `nri-port-monitor` executable to `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations`. Do the same for the `port-monitor-definition.yml` config file:

       ```shell
       cp nri-port-monitor/bin/port-monitor /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/ && cp nri-port-monitor/port-monitor-definition.yml /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/
       ```

    3. Set execution permissions for the binary file `nr-port-monitor` so it can run correctly:

       ```shell
       chmod +x /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/port-monitor
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure the integration [#configure-step]

    1. Move and rename the configuration file:

       ```shell
       cp nri-port-monitor/port-monitor-config.yml.sample /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/port-monitor-config.yml
       ```

    2. Open `port-monitor-config.yml` and edit the config with all the port instances you'd like to monitor:

       ```yml
       integration_name: com.newrelic.tcp-port-monitor

       instances:
       - name: <INSTANCE IDENTIFIER>
           command: metrics
           arguments:
           address: localhost:80
           network: tcp
           timeout: 5
           labels:
           env: prod
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#find-data]

    To easily find your Port Monitoring data, download our pre-built dashboard:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**</DNT> and click on <DNT>**+ Integrations & Agents**</DNT>.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> tab.
    3. In the search box, search for <DNT>**Port Monitoring**</DNT>.
    4. Click on the Port Monitoring dashboard to install it.

    Here's an example NRQL query that returns the status of configured ports:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(status) FROM NetworkPortSample FACET address SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
