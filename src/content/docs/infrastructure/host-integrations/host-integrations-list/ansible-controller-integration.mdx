With our Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform dashboards, you can easily track and visualize your Ansible Automation Platform logs, keep an eye on your jobs, and monitor instance memory.

Built with our infrastructure agent and our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, the Ansible Automation Platform integration gives you a set of pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> that let you view your most critical query data, all in one place.

After setting up the integration with New Relic, see your data in <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

The New Relic infrastructure agent is the foundation for getting your Ansible Automation Platform data into New Relic. If you haven't already done so, install the agent using one of these options:


* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).


## Integrate Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform with New Relic [#integrate]

Once installed, the infrastructure agent can ingest data from your app and send it to New Relic, but you still need to integrate – or establish a line of communication – between the agent and your app. Once integrated, you can get started with an out of the box monitoring solution for your Ansible Automation Platform app.

    title="Step 1. Create a bearer token on Ansible Automation Platform"
    >
Once logged into Ansible Automation Platform, navigate to the **Users** section, select **admin** and then add a **token** to the user. Copy the token and save it in your desired path.

Here is an example token: 

Create a file named "bearer_token_file" in your desired path.

```
touch /home/ansible-automation-patform/bearer_token_file

```
And paste your token in the created file.

```
nano /home/ansible-automation-platform/bearer_token_file
<paste your token>
```

Save and exit the nano editor

    title="Step 2. Configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integration"
    >
    
First, create a file named “nri-prometheus-config.yml” in the path below:

Path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml`

Then, use our [configuration template](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample) to update the created file named "nri-prometheus-config.yml."

Now, update the fields listed below:

1. `cluster_name: “YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME”`
2. `bearer_token_file: “BEARER_TOKEN_FILE_PATH`
3. `urls: [“https://YOUR_HOST_IP:443/api/v2/metrics/?format=txt”]`
4. `Insecure_skip_verify: true`

Your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file should look like this:

```
integrations:
  - name: nri-prometheus
    config:
      # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true
      standalone: false

      # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
      emitters: infra-sdk

      # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
      cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"
      bearer_token_file: "BEARER_TOKEN_FILE_PATH"

      targets:
        - description: Metrics of Ansible Automation Platform can be seen on the below url
          urls: ["https://YOUR_HOST_IP:443/api/v2/metrics/?format=txt"]
          use_bearer: true
      #    tls_config:
      #      ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
      #      cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
      #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

      # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false.
      verbose: false

      # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
      # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
      # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care.
      audit: true

      # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
      # scrape_timeout: "30s"

      # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints.
      scrape_duration: "5s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false.
      insecure_skip_verify: true

    timeout: 10s

    title="Step 3. Forward Ansible controller logs to New Relic"
    >

You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent) to forward Ansible Automation Platform logs to New Relic. 

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in the below path:

Path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`

If you don't see your log file in the above path, then you will need to create a log file by following the above log forwarding documentation.

To create the log file, add the script below to the logging.yml file:

```
  - name: ansible-tower.log
    file: /var/log/tower/tower.log
    attributes:
      logtype: ansible_tower_log

```
</Collapser>

 <Collapser
    id="step4"
    title="Step 4. Restart your infrastructure agent"
    >

Before you can start reading your data use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent. 
</Collapser>

<Collapser
    id="step5"
    title="Step 5. Use NRQL to view your data"
    >
You can use this NRQL query to view your Ansible Automation Platform data:

```
FROM Metric SELECT latest(awx_pending_jobs_total) AS 'Pending Jobs', latest(awx_running_jobs_total) AS 'Running Jobs'
```

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


## See Ansible Automation Controller metrics in a dashboard [#dash]


With the infrastructure agent installed and instrumented with your app, you can view your raw data in our **Metrics & events**. Our default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird's eye view of your system's health. To install our default dashboards, go to our Ansible Automation Controller [instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/ansible-automation-controller)).
