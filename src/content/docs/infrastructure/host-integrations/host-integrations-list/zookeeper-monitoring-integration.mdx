Our Apache ZooKeeper integration monitors the performance of your ZooKeeper clusters, helping you manage, and synchronize your distributed systems. Our Apache ZooKeeper integration gives you a pre-built dashboard that includes cluster-level and node-level metrics.

## Integrate Apache ZooKeeper with New Relic

Before bringing ZooKeeper data into New Relic, you'll need to follow [the infrastructure agent installation steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Apache ZooKeeper app.

You can integrate Apache Zookeeper with New Relic by using `NRI-Flex` for Apache ZooKeeper.

## Use NRI-Flex to capture metrics

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. You need to configure NRI-Flex for Apache ZooKeeper and create a flex configuration file. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `zookeeper-config.yml` on the path below:
    * for Linux, `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`
    * for windows, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`
2. Use the below snippet to update your configuration file named `zookeeper-config.yml`

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-flex
    # interval: 30s
    config:
      name: zookeeperFlex
      apis:
        - name: zookeeper
          event_type: zkSample
          commands:
            - run: echo mntr | nc localhost 2181  ## change to your zookeeper server
              split_by: "\t"  ## split by tab
          snake_to_camel: true
          custom_attributes:
            myCustomAttr: theValue  ## inject your own additional custom attributes
```

## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent 
Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
  ```

## Find your data

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Apache ZooKeeper` to monitor your Zookeeper application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the **+ Add data** page.
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `apache zookeeper`. 
4. The ZooKeeper dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Apache ZooKeeper dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

When you use the `nri-flex` integration your metrics will be exported into the given `EVENT_TYPE`. Here is a NRQL query to check the number of znodes in the ZooKeeper namespace with a `nri-flex` integration:

```sql
FROM <EVENT_TYPE> 
SELECT latest(zkZnodeCount)
```
