Our Linkerd integration is a service mesh for Kubernetes. It makes running services easier and safer by giving you runtime debugging, observability, reliability, and security—all without requiring any changes to your code.

<Steps>
    <Step>
## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

To use the Linkerd integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Linkerd-specific data.
    </Step>
    <Step>

## Enable the Linkerd integration with nri-prometheus [#enable-linkerd]

To set up the Linkerd integration, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `nri-prometheus-config.yml` in the integrations directory:
  ```shell
  touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-prometheus-config.yml
  ```
2. Add the following snippet to your `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file to enable the agent to capture Envoy data:
  ```yml
  integrations:
    - name: nri-prometheus
      config:
        # When standalone is set to false nri-prometheus requires an infrastructure agent to work and send data. Defaults to true 
        standalone: false

        # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk 
        emitters: infra-sdk

        # The name of your cluster. It's important to match other New Relic products to relate the data.
        cluster_name: "YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME"

        targets:
          - description: Linkerd metrics list
            urls: ["http://<ip-address>:4191/metrics","http://<ip-address>:9090/metrics"]

        #     tls_config:
        #     ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
        #     cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
        #      key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"

        # Whether the integration should run in verbose mode or not. Defaults to false
        verbose: false

        # Whether the integration should run in audit mode or not. Defaults to false.
        # Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic. Use this to log all data sent.
        # It does not include verbose mode. This can lead to a high log volume, use with care
        audit: false

        # The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Defaults to 30s.
        # scrape_timeout: "30s"

        # Length in time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints
        scrape_duration: "5s"

        # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
        # For large clusters with many (&gt;400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
        # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
        # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
        # many metrics are being scraped.
        # Default: 4
        # worker_threads: 4

        # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false
        insecure_skip_verify: true
      timeout: 10s
  ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Restart your infrastructure agent. 

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```

In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).        
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Find your data 

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Linkerd` to monitor your Linkerd application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DoNotTranslate>**+ Add data**</DoNotTranslate> page.
2. Click on <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. In the search bar, type `Linkerd`.
4. When the Linkerd dashboard option appears, click to install it.

Your Linkerd dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DoNotTranslate>**Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is a NRQL query to check the Envoy downstream total connections:

```sql
SELECT latest(process_virtual_memory_bytes)/(1024*1024) as 'Memory in MB' FROM Metric
```        
    </Step>
</Steps>
