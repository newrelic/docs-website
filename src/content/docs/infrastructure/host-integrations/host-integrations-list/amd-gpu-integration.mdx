  After you set up our AMD GPU integration, you see a dashboard for your GPU metrics.
</figcaption>

When you install, you'll get a pre-built dashboard containing crucial GPU metrics:

* GPU utilization
* Memory usage and availability
* Active compute processes
* Clock frequencies
* Temperature monitoring
* Power consumption
* Performance states
* Dynamic and static information about each supported device

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent

    To capture data with New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your GPU performance.

    You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways:

    * Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
    * If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Install AMD SMI

    Before configuring the Flex integration, you need to install AMD's SMI utility:

    ### Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```shell
    # Add AMD GPU repository
    wget -q -O - https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ ubuntu main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
    
    # Update and install
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install amd-smi
    ```

    ### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
    ```shell
    # Add AMD GPU repository
    sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo <<EOF
    [ROCm]
    name=ROCm
    baseurl=https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/yum/rpm
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key
    EOF
    
    # Install AMD SMI
    sudo yum install amd-smi
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      After installation, ensure the amd-smi binary is accessible in your system PATH and your user has proper permissions to access GPU devices.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure Flex integration for AMD GPUs

    Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent and can be integrated with AMD SMI, a command line utility to monitor AMD GPU devices.

    Follow these steps to configure Flex:

    1. Create a file named `amd-smi-gpu-monitoring.yml` in this path:

    ```shell
    sudo touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/amd-smi-gpu-monitoring.yml
    ```

    You may also download from the [git repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/examples/amd-smi-gpu-monitoring.yml).

    2. Update the `amd-smi-gpu-monitoring.yml` file with the integration config:

    Copy the file content (`.yml`) from the [AMD SMI GPU monitoring configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/nri-flex/master/examples/amd-smi-gpu-monitoring.yml) and paste it into your configuration file.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Confirm GPU metrics are being ingested

    The Flex configuration will be automatically detected and executed by the infrastructure agent, there's no need to restart the agent. You can confirm metrics are being ingested by running this NRQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM AMDGpuSample
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Monitor your application

    You can create custom dashboards to monitor your AMD GPU metrics. Here are some example NRQL queries to get you started:

    ### GPU Utilization
    ```sql
    SELECT average(gfx_activity_percent) FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### Memory Usage
    ```sql
    SELECT average(vram_used_mb), average(vram_total_mb), average(vram_free_mb) FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### Temperature Monitoring
    ```sql
    SELECT average(temp_edge_c), average(temp_hotspot_c), average(temp_mem_c) 
    FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### Power Consumption
    ```sql
    SELECT average(socket_power_w), max(max_power_w) FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### Clock Frequencies
    ```sql
    SELECT average(gfx_0_clk_mhz), average(mem_0_clk_mhz), average(fclk_0_clk_mhz) FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### GPU Activity by Type
    ```sql
    SELECT average(gfx_activity_percent), average(umc_activity_percent), average(mm_activity_percent) 
    FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### ECC Error Monitoring
    ```sql
    SELECT sum(ecc_total_correctable), sum(ecc_total_uncorrectable) FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    ### PCIe Performance
    ```sql
    SELECT average(pcie_bandwidth_mb_s), average(pcie_current_bandwidth_sent), average(pcie_current_bandwidth_received) 
    FROM AMDGpuSample TIMESERIES AUTO FACET gpu_id
    ```

    To create a comprehensive dashboard:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**</DNT> and click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Create a dashboard**</DNT>.
    3. Add charts using the NRQL queries provided above.
    4. Customize your dashboard layout and save it.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Common issues and solutions:

**AMD SMI not found:**
- Ensure AMD SMI is properly installed and accessible in your PATH
- Verify AMD SMI with: `amd-smi version`

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure your user has proper permissions to access GPU devices
- You may need to add your user to the `render` group:
  ```shell
  sudo usermod -a -G render $USER
  ```
- Log out and log back in for changes to take effect

**No GPU detected:**
- Verify AMD GPU is detected by the system: `lspci | grep -i amd`
- Check if amdgpu driver is loaded: `lsmod | grep amdgpu`
- Ensure your AMD GPU is supported by AMD SMI

**Missing metrics:**
- Some older AMD GPUs may not support all sensors
- Check which metrics are available: `amd-smi metric --help`
- Verify GPU compatibility: `amd-smi list`

## What's next? [#next]

You can adapt the Flex configuration to include or exclude information available from the AMD SMI utility. Additional AMD SMI options include:

* `amd-smi list` - List available GPU devices
* `amd-smi static` - Static GPU information
* `amd-smi metric` - Real-time GPU metrics
* `amd-smi process` - Process information using GPU
* `amd-smi monitor` - Continuous monitoring mode
