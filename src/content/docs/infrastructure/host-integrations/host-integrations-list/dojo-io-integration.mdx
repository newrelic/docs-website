With the help of New Relic's Dojo dashboard, you can track your application's core web vitals, user time on the site, and browser performance metrics like Initial page load, route change, throughput and page views with Javascript errors. Built with our infrastructure agent and our browser monitoring agent, the Dojo dashboard lets you view all your most important data in one place.

## Install the infrastructure agent and Dojo integration [#install]

1. Install the infrastructure agent (optional)
Before getting Dojo data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent to get details about your host.
* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=999174fa-ed8b-d707-af7b-8e4f8fd03cc1) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. Or if you prefer, you can install the infrastructure agent by [following the docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent).
* By integrating this infrastructure agent in your system, you can see the information for the CPU usage, memory usage, storage usage, disk usage, network traffic, and more.
2. Follow our [browser monitoring guide](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-summary-page/) to instrument your Dojo application (or) follow this steps to [install the Browser Monitoring Agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/).
3. Monitor your metrics by using the dashboard template on one.newrelic.com.
4. Use the NRQL query below to view your data:

```sql
SELECT firstInputDelay
FROM PageViewTiming
```
