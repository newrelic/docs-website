Our Temporal Cloud integration monitors the performance of your Temporal Cloud data, helping you diagnose issues in your Workflows, Namespaces and durable applications. 

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

    To use the Temporal Cloud integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Temporal-specific data such as database and instance metrics.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure `nri-flex` for Temporal Cloud [#configure-flex]

    Temporal Cloud metrics are accessible via `https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics`, you will need to [authenticate with a Temporal Cloud API Key that has metrics read authorization](https://docs.temporal.io/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/api-reference#authentication).

      Flex requires a [New Relic account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account) and is compatible with the following operating systems/platforms:

      1. Linux
      2. Windows
      3. Kubernetes

         For more information on compatible distros and versions, see the [Infrastructure agent compatibility page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).
    </Callout>

    1. Create file with named `nri-flex-temporal-cloud-config.yml` in this path:

       ```shell
       touch /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/
       ```

    2. Below is a `nri-flex` configuration file. Be sure to copy and paste its contents into your previously created `nri-flex-temporal-cloud-config.yml` file, and remember to update your Temporal Cloud API Key:

       ```yml
       # nri-flex configuration for Temporal Cloud OpenMetrics Endpoint
       # Place this file in /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/
       #
       # Prerequisites:
       # 1. Create a Service Account in Temporal Cloud UI (Settings > Service Accounts)
       # 2. Assign the "Metrics Read-Only" Account Level Role to the service account
       # 3. Generate an API key for the service account
       # 4. Set the TEMPORAL_API_KEY environment variable or replace the placeholder below
       #

       integrations:
         - name: nri-flex
           interval: 60s
           timeout: 30s
           config:
             name: TemporalCloudMetrics
             apis:
               # Collect all Temporal Cloud metrics
               - name: TemporalCloud
                 event_type: TemporalCloudSample
                 url: https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics
                 headers:
                   Authorization: Bearer ${TEMPORAL_API_KEY}
                   Accept: application/openmetrics-text
                 prometheus:
                   enable: true
                 custom_attributes:
                   integration: temporal-cloud
                   source: openmetrics
       ```

    3. Use our instructions [to restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/):

       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
       ```

    4. Wait a few minutes until data starts folowing into your [New Relic account](https://one.newrelic.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#find-your-data]

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named Temporal Cloud to monitor your Temporal Cloud metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), go to the **+ Integrations & Agents** page.
    2. Click on **Dashboards**.
    3. In the search bar, type **Temporal Cloud**.
    4. The Temporal Cloud dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

    Your Temporal Cloud dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the Dashboards UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

    Here is a NRQL query to check the Temporal Cloud frontend service requests grouped by namespace and operation:

    ```sql
    FROM TemporalCloudSample SELECT latest(`temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_request_count.gauge`) FACET temporal_namespace, operation
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
