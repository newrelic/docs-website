  After setting up the integration with New Relic, see your data in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

Complete the following steps to install the integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent [#install-infra-agent]

    To use the Sendmail integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Sendmail-specific data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Use NRI-Flex to capture metrics

    Flex allows you to capture Apache Zookeeper metrics. It comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent you installed in the previous step.

    1. Create a file named `sendmail-flex-config.yml` in the `/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` path.

    2. Update the `sendmail-flex-config.yml` with the following configuration example.

       Make sure to replace `FAILED_MESSAGES_FILE_NAME` references with your file name. To find this file name, go to `/var/mail/` and check the file that has been created for failed messages.

       ```yml

    ## Forward your Sendmail logs to New Relic [#forward-logs]

    You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) capability to forward Sendmail logs to New Relic.

    Add the following script to `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/logging.yml`:

    ````yml
    logs:
    - name: mail.log
        file: /var/log/mail.log
        attributes:
        logtype: sendmail_log
    - name: mail.err
        file: /var/log/mail.err
        attributes:
        logtype: sendmail_error
    ```        


    ````
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent [#restart-agent]

    Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find your data [#find-data]

    You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Sendmail` to monitor your Sendmail application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

    1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the <DNT>**+ Integrations & Agents**</DNT> page.
    2. Click on <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>.
    3. In the search bar, type `sendmail`.
    4. The Sendmail dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

    Your Sendmail dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT> UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

    Here is a NRQL query to find your latest message's sent status:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(sent) as 'Sent', latest(deferred) as ‘Deferred’ 
    FROM SendmailMessageStatus
    ```

    Here is a NRQL query to find view the Sendmail service status:

    ```sql
    SELECT latest(value) as 'Service Up' 
    FROM SendmailUp 
    TIMESERIES AUTO
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
