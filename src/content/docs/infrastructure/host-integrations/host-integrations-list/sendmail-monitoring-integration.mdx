## Install the infrastructure agent [#install-infra-agent]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. 

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 


## Configure NRI-Flex for Sendmail [#configure-nri-flex]

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `sendmail-flex-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```

2. Update your configuration file `sendmail-flex-config.yml` using the following snippet. 

Make sure to replace "FAILED_MESSAGES_FILE_NAME" references with your file name. To find this file name, go to `/var/mail/` and check the file that has been created for failed messages.

```yml

## Forward your Sendmail logs to New Relic [#forward-logs]

You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Sendmail logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in this path:

```shell
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```

Add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
  
logs:
  - name: mail.log
    file: /var/log/mail.log
    attributes:
      logtype: sendmail_log
  - name: mail.err
    file: /var/log/mail.err
    attributes:
      logtype: sendmail_error
```


## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent [#restart-agent]

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```

In a couple of minutes, your application will send metrics to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).


## Find your data [#find-data]

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Sendmail` to monitor your Sendmail application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the **+ Add data** page. 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `sendmail`. 
4. The Sendmail dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Sendmail dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

Here is a NRQL query to find your latest message's sent status:

```sql
SELECT latest(sent) as 'Sent', latest(deferred) as ‘Deferred’ 
FROM SendmailMessageStatus
```

 Here is a NRQL query to find view the Sendmail service status: 

```sql
SELECT latest(value) as 'Service Up' 
FROM SendmailUp 
TIMESERIES AUTO
```
