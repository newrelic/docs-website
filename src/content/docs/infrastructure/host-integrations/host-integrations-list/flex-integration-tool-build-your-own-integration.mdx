New Relic provides [integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/). If you're already using New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways you can create your own integration:

* With infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations), see our [Integrations SDK](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations-sdk).
* For telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions, use our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic).
* Build a custom [New Relic app](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality.

## What is Flex? [#what-is-it]

New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic.

Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an [example config](#example).

After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then [query Flex data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Flex comes bundled with our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) version 1.10.7 or higher ([update](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent) \| [check version](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent#check-version)) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes.

## How does Flex work? [#how-does-it-work]

Flex uses [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data:

1. You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="example"
       title="Example config"
     >
       The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named `flex-uptime.yml`. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml`.

       ```
       integrations:
         - name: nri-flex    
           config:
             name: linuxUptimeIntegration
             apis:
               - name: Uptime
                 commands:
                   - run: 'cat /proc/uptime'
                     split: horizontal
                     split_by: \s+
                     set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds]
       ```

       Some notes on what this configuration does:

       * `run` defines the command to execute.
       * The name indicated by `name: Uptime` is appended with `Sample` to generate an [event](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) called `UptimeSample`.
       * The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix.
       * The `split_by: \s+` splits the fields based on the space character.
       * The command generates [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) attached to the `UptimeSample` event. The attributes are named `uptimeSeconds` and `idletimeSeconds`.
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
2. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic.
3. You can then [query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards.

## Learn more [#get]

The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent, and it can be configured like any other on-host integration. Learn more about [configuration options](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-standard-configuration-format).
