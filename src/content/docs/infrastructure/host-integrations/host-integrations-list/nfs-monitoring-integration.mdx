Our NFS [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NFS service to our platform, where you can see disk usage data so that you can more easily find the source of any problems.

Complete the following steps to set up the NFS integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Check compatibility and requirements [#req]

    Our integration is compatible with NFS version 3 and above.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Install the infrastructure agent

    To use the NFS integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Install and activate [#install]

    The NFS integration is already activated and installed by default with the infrastructure agent. There are no installation or activation requirements, as it works out of the box.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

    To find your integration data:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Third-party services**</DNT>
    2. Search for <DNT>**NFS integration**</DNT>.
    3. Click on the NFS dashboard.

    When [querying your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), NFS data is attached to the `NFSSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).

    For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Metric data [#metrics]

The NFS integration collects the following metrics:

## Disabling the integration [#disable]

Set `metrics_nfs_sample_rate` to `-1` in the infrastructure agent [configuration file](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#metrics-nfs-sample-rate) to avoid scraping NFS metrics.
