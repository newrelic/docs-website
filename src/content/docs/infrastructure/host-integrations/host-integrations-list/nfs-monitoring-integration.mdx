Our NFS [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NFS service to our platform, where you can see disk usage data so that you can more easily find the source of any problems.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements [#req]

Our integration is compatible with NFS version 3 or 4.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic), minimum version 1.5.40, on host (NFS client)
* Linux distribution [compatible with the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems)

## Install and activate [#install]

The NFS integration is already activated and installed by default. Therefore, there are no installation or activation requirements, as it works out of the box. See [samples variables](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#samples-variables), and search for NFS for more info.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To find your integration data go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > Third-party services** and select the **NFS integration** link.

When [querying your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), NFS data is attached to the `NFSSample` [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type).

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data [#metrics]

The NFS integration collects the following metrics:
