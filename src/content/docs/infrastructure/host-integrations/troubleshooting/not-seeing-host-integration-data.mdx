## Problem

You created an on-host integration with New Relic, but you are not seeing data in the infrastructure UI.

## Solution

To troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. Check to see if the integration is activated and reporting. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Third-party Services** and look for the integration name under **Active integrations**.
2. Run [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) to check for common issues and validate your configuration files.
3. Verify that your on-host integration meets New Relic's integration requirements:

     >
       If you are not receiving data from your on-host integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements.

               Check your configuration file:

               1. Use a validator such as [yamllint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to verify it is a valid YAML file.
               2. Verify that the file is in the [correct location](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/create-activate-infrastructure-integration#placement-naming).

             <td>
               Check your definition file:

               1. Use a validator such as [yamllint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to verify it is a valid YAML file.
               2. Verify that the header fields have the [required format](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-definition-file-specifications#def-header).
               3. Verify that the [prefix for inventory](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-definition-file-specifications#def-commands) set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep.
               4. Verify that the file is in the [correct location](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/create-activate-infrastructure-integration#placement-naming).

4. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for [error logs](#check-errors) and [integration loading](#check-loading):

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="check-errors"
       title="Check the integration log file for error messages"
     >
       **Recommendation:** [Configure a log file](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) in the infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily.

       When there is an error loading or running your integration, the infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if `verbose` mode is disabled.

       1. Check the log file for lines that include `"level=error"`.
       2. If there are no error messages, check whether the infrastructure agent is [loading the integration correctly](#check-loading).
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="check-loading"
       title="Check that the integration is loading correctly"
     >
       To verify whether the infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly, try these steps:

       1. Enable [`verbose` mode](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting-infrastructure) in the infrastructure agent configuration.
       2. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
       3. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages:

          ```
          "loaded plugin" plugin=<YOUR_INTEGRATION_NAME>
          "found plugin config file" plugin-path="<YOUR_INTEGRATION_CONFIG_PATH>"
          ```
       4. Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading.

          The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

          **JSON payload example**

          ```
          nginx-server-metrics: {\"name\":\"com.newrelic.nginx\",\"protocol_version\":\"1\",\"integration_version\":\"0.5.0\",\"metrics\":
          [{\"event_type\":\"NginxSample\",\"net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond\":0.10344827586206896,\"net.connectionsActive\":1,
          \"net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond\":0,\"net.connectionsReading\":0,\"net.connectionsWaiting\":0,\"net.connectionsWriting\":1,
          \"net.requestsPerSecond\":0.10344827586206896,\"software.edition\":\"open source\",\"software.version\":\"1.4.6 (Ubuntu)\"}],\"inventory\":{},\"events\":[]}
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="check-load"
       title="Check resource consumption"
     >
       If integrations stop reporting, it may be due to insufficient system resources. We recommend to have no more than 100 instances of an integration running at the same time.
