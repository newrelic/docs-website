## Problem

You have config parameters defined in the infrastructure agent and you want to pass the parameters to one of its [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations).

## Solution

You can pass config parameters set in the agent to its on-host integrations by adding the variable `passthrough_environment` to the infrastructure agent's [configuration file](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/#passthrough_-environment).

Starting with infrastructure agent version 1.24.1, `passthrough_environment` supports regex for variable names.

For example, if you want to pass the proxy options configured in the infrastructure agent to an integration, add the following configuration to the infrastructure config file:

```
passthrough_environment:
  - HTTPS_PROXY
  - HTTP_PROXY
  - MY_REDIS_PASSWORD
  - NRIA_.*
```

Starting with infrastructure agent version 1.14.0, you can also define environment variables as part of the integration configuration file as shown below (`passthrough_environment` config is also required):

```
integration_name: com.newrelic.redis
instances:
  - name: redis-metrics
    command: metrics
    arguments:
      hostname: localhost
      port: 6379
      password: {{MY_REDIS_PASSWORD}}
```
