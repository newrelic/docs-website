Our on-host integrations let you monitor an assortment of third-party services.

## What are on-host integrations? [#overview]

At New Relic, <DNT>**on-host integrations**</DNT> are what we call our integrations that work in tandem with our infrastructure agent. These integrations collect data from supported services and use the infrastructure agent to send that data to New Relic.

Some of our on-host integrations are built using [our Flex integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration), which you can also use to build your own lightweight custom integrations.

## Data reported [#data]

On-host integrations report metrics and inventory data. Some integrations have the option to enable log reporting. Details about the data reported are in the specific docs for each integration.

## Get started [#get-started]

To get started with on-host integrations: If you already have New Relic, go to the [<DNT>**Integrations & Agents**</DNT> page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) and search for the service you want to monitor.

Or, you can:

1. Browse the list of integrations in this section.
2. Review an integration's requirements and follow the procedures to install and configure it.

To browse all integrations, see our [Instant Observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

## Features [#features]

After you install and activate an integration, you'll be able to:

* [Filter and analyze](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) the metrics and configuration data in [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure).
* Create [custom queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) of your integration data.
* Create [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) to monitor problems with your service's performance

## Monitor remote and multi-tenant configurations [#multiple-instances]

Some configurations may use third party elements, such as databases, which reside in non-accessible, remote hosts. Our integrations can fetch data from local and remote hosts or servers, ensuring a continuous monitoring of your service. They also support multi-tenant clustered configurations. By abstracting the service from the host, multiple entities can be monitored as remote instances.

To activate remote monitoring and multi-tenancy in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, use the [`remote_monitoring` parameter](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/understand-use-data/remote-monitoring-host-integrations).
