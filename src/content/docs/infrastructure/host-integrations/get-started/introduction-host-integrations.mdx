Our infrastructure on-host integrations let you monitor an assortment of third-party services. 

## Get started [#get-started]

To get started with on-host integrations: If you already have New Relic, go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace) and search for the service you want to monitor. 

Or, you can: 

1. Browse the list of integrations in this section. 
2. Review an integration's requirements and follow the procedures to install and configure it. 

To browse all integrations, see our [Instant Observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

## Features [#features]

After you install and activate an integration, you'll be able to:

* [Filter and analyze](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) the metrics and configuration data in [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure).
* Create [custom queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) of your integration data.
* Create [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) to monitor problems with your service's performance

## Monitor remote and multi-tenant configurations [#multiple-instances]

Some configurations may use third party elements, such as databases, which reside in non-accessible, remote hosts. Our integrations can fetch data from local and remote hosts or servers, ensuring a continuous monitoring of your service. They also support multi-tenant clustered configurations. By abstracting the service from the host, multiple entities can be monitored as remote instances.

To activate remote monitoring and multi-tenancy in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, use the [`remote_monitoring` parameter](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/understand-use-data/remote-monitoring-host-integrations).
