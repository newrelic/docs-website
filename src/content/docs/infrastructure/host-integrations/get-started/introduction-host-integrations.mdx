[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) allow you to send data from popular products and services to New Relic. You can select from our [list of available on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list) to collect and send data to our platform.

## Get started [#features]

To get started with on-host integrations:

1. Browse the lists of [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list).
2. If you do not already have New Relic infrastructure monitoring enabled, [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic).
3. Follow the procedures to install and configure the selected on-host integration, including prerequisites for compatibility and other requirements.

If we don't currently offer an integration for a service you use, consider creating your own integration with [Flex](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration).

## Features

After you install and activate an integration, you will be able to:

* [Filter and analyze](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) the metrics and configuration data in [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure).
* Create [custom queries and charts](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) of your integration data.
* Create [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) to monitor problems with your services' performance in [New Relic's alerts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration).

## Monitor remote and multi-tenant configurations [#multiple-instances]

Some configurations may use third party elements, such as databases, which reside in non-accessible, remote hosts. Our integrations can fetch data from local and remote hosts or servers, ensuring a continuous monitoring of your service. They also support multi-tenant clustered configurations—by abstracting the service from the host, multiple entities can be monitored as remote instances.

You can activate remote monitoring and multi-tenancy in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations with the [`remote_monitoring` parameter](/docs/remote-monitoring-host-integrations).
