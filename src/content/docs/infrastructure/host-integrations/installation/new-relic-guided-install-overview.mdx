If you haven't already, [sign up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) so you can instrument your systems and send telemetry data to New Relic. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent.

Ready to get started? Click the **Guided install** button. Or, if your account reports data through our [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers/), click **EU Guided install**.

Our **Guided Install** discovers the applications, infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument.

<InstallFeedback />

## Why it matters [#why-it-matters]

With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes.

The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for your host environment, and a [library of installation recipes](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library) to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you.

Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs.

## CLI flags [#cli-flags]

Customize and debug your installation with CLI flags. Use the "assume yes" flag `-y` for automated installation with sensible defaults, change the verbosity of the output with `--debug` or `--trace`, add tags, or use custom install recipes. You can find a full list of available options in our open source repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/newrelic_install.md).

## Some technical details [#technical-details]

The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They are written in YAML format for each type of system to be instrumented and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Additional information is available in our open source repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library/blob/main/docs/README.md).

## On-host integration (OHI) recipes [#ohi-recipes]

The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command.

To install any individual on-host integration, you would use a command similar to the following, which specifies the type of integration you want to install. This is the syntax for Linux:

```
curl -Ls https://download.newrelic.com/install/newrelic-cli/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=INSERT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID NEW_RELIC_REGION=INSERT_YOUR_REGION /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INSERT_THE_INTEGRATION_NAME
```

For example, to install the Apache integration:

```
curl -Ls https://download.newrelic.com/install/newrelic-cli/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration
```

This is the syntax for Windows:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12, tls'; (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://download.newrelic.com/install/newrelic-cli/scripts/install.ps1", "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"); & PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $env:TEMP\install.ps1; $env:NEW_RELIC_API_KEY='INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY'; $env:NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID='INSERT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID'; $env:NEW_RELIC_REGION='INSERT_YOUR_REGION'; & 'C:\Program Files\New Relic\New Relic CLI\newrelic.exe' install
```

<Callout variant="important">
  On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent.

  All other integrations are only supported on Linux.
</Callout>

Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

The table below lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference:

## Troubleshoot common problems [#troubleshoot]

As we identify areas where the guided install fails, we'll document them here and provide some troubleshooting guidance.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="mysql"
    title="MySQL: Incorrect user permissions"
  >
    To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions.

    These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions:

    Create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password.

    ```
    sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';"
    ```

    Give replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

    ```
    sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
    ```

    Give select privileges to `newrelic@localhost` with a maximum of 5 connections.

    ```
    sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
    ```

    Once done, your next guided install attempt should work.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="nginx"
    title="NGINX: No status URL "
  >
    To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL.

    `status_url`: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of `127.0.0.1` is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example:

    `status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status`

    You can read more about the `status_url` in these NGINX docs:

    * For NGINX Open Source: [HTTP stub status module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html)

    * For NGINX Plus: [HTTP status module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html) and [HTTP API module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html)

      There are different ways to set `status_url`, depending on how NGINX was installed:

    * If enabled via Kubernetes: See [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).

    * If enabled via Amazon ECS: See [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

    * If installed on-host: Edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `nginx-config.yml`.
