The F5 [open-source integration](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) monitors performance metrics (including Virtual Server, Pool, Node, and Memory stats) from [F5](https://support.f5.com/csp/knowledge-center/software/BIG-IP) and reports data to New Relic Infrastructure.

For requirements, installation, and configuration information, see the [F5 On-Host Integration README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-f5) on GitHub.
