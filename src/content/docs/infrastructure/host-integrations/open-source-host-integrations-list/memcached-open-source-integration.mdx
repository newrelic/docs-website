The Memcached [open-source integration](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) collects performance counters and stats from [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) and reports data to New Relic Infrastructure.

For requirements, installation, and configuration information, see the [Memcached On-Host Integration README](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-memcached) on GitHub.
