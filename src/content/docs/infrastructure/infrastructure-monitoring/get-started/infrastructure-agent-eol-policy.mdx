The following are the specific policies and dates for support of our infrastructure monitoring agent. See our documentation about [general EOL policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) for information about New Relic's overall end-of-life policy.

## New Relic infrastructure monitoring agent releases and support dates [#infrastructure-eol]

Starting with version v1.28.0, all infrastructure agent releases are officially supported for one year. 

The following table lists the end support date for older versions. Please [update your infrastructure monitoring agent version](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent/) to the [latest release](/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes).

## Operating systems and runtime platforms [#infra-os-runtime]

The agent is supported in a wide variety of environments. See [Requirements for the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/) for an up-to-date list of supported operating systems, architectures, and runtime environments.

The infrastructure monitoring agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. The agent might be compatible and packages might be available for EOL systems, but support is not guaranteed.
