New Relic provides flexible, dynamic observability of your entire infrastructure, from services running in the cloud or on dedicated hosts to containers running in orchestrated environments. You can connect the health and performance of all your hosts to application context, logs, and configuration changes.

With infrastructure monitoring, modern operations teams get complete observability of complex and hybrid systems, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances.

Read on to learn about our infrastructure monitoring solutions, and to see how to get started. If you haven't already, create your free New Relic account below to start monitoring your data today.

## Our infrastructure monitoring solutions [#infrastructure-solutions]

We have a wide range of infrastructure monitoring solutions. Here's a summary:

* Our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
* Our [Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure) and [Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) integrations.
* Our [cloud integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#cloud-integrations) for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
* Our [Prometheus integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic).
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#on-host-integrations) for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data.

## Quick start: Use our guided install [#quick]

The quickest way to get started is to use our guided install, which installs our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) and discovers applications and log sources in your environment.

## Reduce MTTR with actionable data [#why-it-matters]

Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your [mean-time-to-resolution](https://newrelic.com/devops/how-to-reduce-mttr) (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. From the **Inventory** page you can search across your entire estate to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts.

<img
  title="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Inventory"
  alt="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Inventory"
  src={infrastructureInventory}
/>

<figcaption>
  The **Inventory** page focuses on all the infrastructure [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) in your estate.
</figcaption>

From the **Events** page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other [key event](/docs/infrastructure-events-page#types) changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure. Our solution [securely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security) collects and displays your data in five seconds, so your monitoring never lags behind reality.

<img
  title="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Events"
  alt="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Events"
  src={infrastructureEvents}
/>

<figcaption>
  The **Events** page contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts.
</figcaption>

With our infrastructure monitoring tools you can also:

* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) to drill down into your [infrastructure events](/docs/default-infrastructure-events-attributes) and build [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) that you can share with your team.
* Troubleshoot performance issues, no matter where the issue occurs—server-side or application-side—thanks to [APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).
* [Create, view, or update alert settings](/docs/add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) directly from the relevant infrastructure chart. For example, you can create a [host not reporting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition) alert condition.

## View logs for your infrastructure and app data [#logs-context]

Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster! With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform.

You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's or host's UI. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic! For more information, see our [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context) documentation.

If your <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent doesn't support our automatic logs in context solution yet, you can continue to use our manual logs in context solutions, and [forward your logs via our infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) or other [supported third-party log forwarder](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic).

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install]

If you don't want to use our [guided install](#quick), the simplest way to install the infrastructure agent is [with a package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager) (Linux) or with the [MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer) (Windows).

If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure step-by-step, see our tutorials to install the agent for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager) \| [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server) \| [Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-agent-aws-elastic-beanstalk) \| [Ansible](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-using-ansible) \| [Chef](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-using-chef) \| [Puppet](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-puppet).

## Our infrastructure service integrations [#aws]

Our infrastructure integrations give you access to the metrics of many popular services and systems. Our integrations include:

* Cloud platform integrations: [Amazon](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list), [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations), and [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list).
* Our [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure), and our [Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie).
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list), like NGINX, Cassandra, MySQL, and many more: these work in concert with our infrastructure agent.
* Make your own integration with [New Relic Flex](/docs/introduction-new-relics-flex-integration).
