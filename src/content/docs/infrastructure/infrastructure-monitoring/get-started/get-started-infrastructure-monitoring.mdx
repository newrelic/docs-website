New Relic lets you monitor your software infrastructure so you can deliver reliable systems. Whether you work in the cloud, on dedicated hosts, or with containers running in orchestrated environments, you can use infrastructure monitoring to improve health and performance outcomes.

## One agent, many capabilities [#overview]

To get access to our infrastructure monitoring capability, you need the infrastructure agent. When you install the agent, it collects performance and health data about system resources and processes for on-premise or virtualized hosts. From there, you can configure the agent to pair with one of our supported [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations), or to [forward logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).

Infrastructure monitoring empowers modern operations teams to dig deep into complex and hybrid systems, from a single data center to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances. Whatever your architecture looks like, our infrastructure monitoring capability helps you troubleshoot and improve your systems. Here are some solutions:

* Our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
* Our [Kubernetes](/install/kubernetes) and [Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) integrations.
* Our [cloud integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#cloud-integrations) for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
* Our [Prometheus integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic).
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#on-host-integrations) for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data.

## Reduce MTTR with actionable data [#why-it-matters]

Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your [mean-time-to-resolution](https://newrelic.com/devops/how-to-reduce-mttr) (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. Here's an example of how infrastructure data can help you:

From the <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page, focus on all the infrastructure [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) in your estate.

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Infrastructure monitoring > Inventory**</DNT>: Search across your entire system to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts.
</figcaption>

From the <DNT>**Events**</DNT> page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other [key event](/docs/infrastructure-events-page#types) changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure.

<figcaption>
  The <DNT>**Events**</DNT> page contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts.
</figcaption>

However you use it, our solution [securely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security) collects and displays your data so your monitoring never lags behind reality.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install-infra-agent]

To get acccess to infrastructure monitoring, you'll first need to install an agent. You can install the infrastructure agent in Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Depending on your observability needs, you have a few different options for deploying the agent in your system. We recommend reviewing our [Choose your infrastructure agent install method](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/choose-infra-install-method) to decide the option that fits your use case.

Most of our solutions depend on installing the infrastructure agent first to send data in concert with it.

## Our infrastructure service integrations [#aws]

Our infrastructure integrations give you access to the metrics of many popular services and systems. Our integrations include:

* Cloud platform integrations: [Amazon](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list), [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations), and [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list).
* Our [Kubernetes integration](/install/kubernetes), and our [Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie).
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list), like NGINX, Cassandra, MySQL, and many more: these work in concert with our infrastructure agent.
* Make your own integration with [New Relic Flex](/docs/introduction-new-relics-flex-integration).

## View logs for your infrastructure and app data [#logs-context]

Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster! With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform.

You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's or host's UI. For more information, see our [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context) documentation.

If your <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent doesn't support our automatic logs in context solution yet, you can continue to use our manual logs in context solutions, and [forward your logs via our infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) or other [supported third-party log forwarder](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic).
