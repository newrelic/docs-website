New Relic provides flexible, dynamic observability of your entire infrastructure, from services running in the cloud or on dedicated hosts to containers running in orchestrated environments. You can connect the health and performance of all your hosts to application context, logs, and configuration changes.

With infrastructure monitoring, modern operations teams get complete observability of complex and hybrid systems, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances.

## Our infrastructure monitoring solutions [#infrastructure-solutions]

We have a wide range of infrastructure monitoring solutions. Here's a summary: 

* Our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
* Our [Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure) and [Pixie](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie) integrations.
* Our [cloud integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#cloud-integrations) for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. 
* Our [Prometheus integrations](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic).
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/#on-host-integrations) for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data. 


## Quick start: Use our guided install [#quick]

The quickest way to get started is to use our guided install, which installs our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) and discovers applications and log sources in your environment.

![A screenshot of the guided install CLI.](./images/guided-install-cli.png "The guided install CLI.")

The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, check out our other options below.

## Reduce MTTR with actionable data [#why-it-matters]

Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your [mean-time-to-resolution](https://newrelic.com/devops/how-to-reduce-mttr) (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. From the **Inventory** page you can search across your entire estate to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts.

![New Relic One - Infrastructure monitoring - Inventory](./images/nrone-infrastructure-inventory.png "New Relic One - Infrastructure monitoring - Inventory")

<figcaption>
  The **Inventory** page in New Relic One focuses on all the infrastructure [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) in your estate.
</figcaption>

From the **Events** page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other [key event](/docs/infrastructure-events-page#types) changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure. Our solution [securely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security) collects and displays your data in five seconds, so your monitoring never lags behind reality.

![New Relic One - Infrastructure monitoring - Events](./images/nrone-infrastructure-events.png "New Relic One - Infrastructure monitoring - Events")

<figcaption>
  The **Events** page in New Relic One contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts.
</figcaption>

With our infrastructure monitoring tools you can also:

* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) to drill down into your [infrastructure events](/docs/default-infrastructure-events-attributes) and build [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) that you can share with your team.
* Troubleshoot performance issues, no matter where the issue occurs—server-side or application-side—thanks to [APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).
* [Create, view, or update alert settings](/docs/add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) directly from the relevant infrastructure chart. For example, you can create a [host not reporting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition) alert condition.

## View logs for your infrastructure and app data [#logs-context] 

Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform.

You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. For more information, see our [log forwarding documentation](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/).

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install]

Our open source infrastructure agent is a [lightweight](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/agent-performance-overhead) executable file that works in the background to collect data from your operating system. 

If you don't want to use our [guided install](#quick), the simplest way to install the infrastructure agent is [with a package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-linux-using-package-manager) (Linux) or with the [MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer) (Windows). You can also use our installation assistants:

## Our infrastructure service integrations [#aws]

Our infrastructure integrations give you access to the metrics of many popular services and systems. Our integrations include: 

* Cloud platform integrations: [Amazon](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list), [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations), and [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list). 
* Our [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure), and our [Pixie integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie). 
* Our [on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list), like NGINX, Cassandra, MySQL, and many more: these work in concert with our infrastructure agent. 
* Make your own integration with [New Relic Flex](/docs/introduction-new-relics-flex-integration).

## Filter your hosts [#filter-sets]

[Filter sets](/docs/scopes-organize-your-infrastructure) allow you to organize your hosts based on criteria that matter most to you. You can filter your hosts by any [infrastructure attribute](/docs/default-infrastructure-events-attributes), such as geographic location, hostname, or Linux distribution.

You can also filter on [Amazon attributes](/docs/default-infrastructure-events-attributes#aws-ec2-attributes), such as region or instance type, and add [custom attributes](/docs/meatballs-configuring-your-agent#attributes) to define unique metadata, such as what team manages the host or the services running.

## Explore your infrastructure data

You can [query and visualize your infrastructure data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) in New Relic One:

* Sample and search [infrastructure events](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events), such as to gain full understanding of the data being collected.
* Browse your data visually with the [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
* Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql), or query your data using our PromQL-style queries.
* Use [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time.
