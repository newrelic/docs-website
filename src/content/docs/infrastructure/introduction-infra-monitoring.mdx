New Relic has tools to help you monitor your software infrastructure so you can deliver reliable systems. Whether you work in the cloud, on dedicated hosts, or with containers running in orchestrated environments, you can use infrastructure monitoring to improve health and performance outcomes.

## On-premises and virtual host monitoring [#infra-agent-intro]

If you want to monitor on-premises or virtual hosts, you can install our infrastructure agent. It collects performance and health data about system resources and processes. From there, you can use the infrastructure agent in combination with a number of [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) that extend monitoring to infrastructure tools such as databases, messaging services, and application servers. You can also use the infrastructure agent to [forward logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).

<img

  alt="Agents and New Relic"
  src="/images/infrastructure_diagram_angets-and-nr.webp"
/>

You can install the infrastructure agent in Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Depending on your observability needs, you have a few different options for deploying the agent in your system. We recommend reviewing our [Choose your infrastructure agent install method](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/choose-infra-install-method) to decide the option that fits your use case.

## Cloud integrations [#cloud]

Our cloud integrations collect data from cloud platform services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations and they do not require the use of our infrastructure agent: you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account.

## Reduce MTTR with actionable data [#why-it-matters]

Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your [mean-time-to-resolution](https://newrelic.com/devops/how-to-reduce-mttr) (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. Here's an example of how infrastructure data can help you:

From the <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page, focus on all the infrastructure [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) in your estate.

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Infrastructure monitoring > Inventory**</DNT>: Search across your entire system to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts.
</figcaption>

From the <DNT>**Events**</DNT> page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other [key event](/docs/infrastructure-events-page#types) changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure.

<img
  title="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Events"
  alt="New Relic - Infrastructure monitoring - Events"
  src="/images/infrastructure_screenshot-full_events-page.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The <DNT>**Events**</DNT> page contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts.
</figcaption>

However you use it, our solution [securely](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security) collects and displays your data so your monitoring never lags behind reality.

## View logs for your infrastructure and app data [#logs-context]

Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster! With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need. These files serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform.

You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's or host's UI. For more information, see our [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context) documentation.

If your <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agent doesn't support our automatic logs in context solution yet, you can continue to use our manual logs in context solutions, and [forward your logs via our infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) or other [supported third-party log forwarder](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic).
