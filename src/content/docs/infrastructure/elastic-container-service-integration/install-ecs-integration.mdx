New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) environment.

## Install overview

Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the [requirements](/docs/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration#requirements). During the install process:

* **For EC2 and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:** The infrastructure agent (`newrelic-infra`) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the EC2 instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers.

* **For AWS Fargate launch type:** The infrastructure agent (`newrelic-infra`) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The [AWS Fargate documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nginx-reverse-proxy-sidecar-container-on-amazon-ecs/) defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application.

Install options:

* [Install using AWS CloudFormation](#cloud-formation-install)
* [Install using automatic script](#auto-script-install)
* [Install manually](#manual-install)

## Install using CloudFormation [#cloud-formation-install]

One [install option](#install-overview) is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for EC2, EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) and AWS Fargate launch types:

1. To register the ECS integration task, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/task/master.yaml&stackName=NewRelicECSIntegration). Ensure youâ€™re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources:
   * A secret that stores the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
   * A policy to access the license key.
   * An instance role to be used as an ECS task `ExecutionRole`, with access to the license key.
   * For EC2 and External (ECS Anywhere) launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task.
2. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type:

     <Collapser
       id="ec2-cloudformation"
       title="EC2 launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for EC2 launch type:

       To create a service that runs the task on every EC2 container instance, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/service.yaml&NewRelicInfraTaskVersion=1).

       Select EC2 Launch type. Then a Service named `newrelic-infra` will be created in the cluster.
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="external-cloudformation"
       title="External (ECS Anywhere) launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:

       To create a service that runs the task on every external container instance, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/service.yaml&NewRelicInfraTaskVersion=1).

       Select EXTERNAL Launch type. Then a Service named `newrelic-infra-external` will be created in the cluster.
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="fargate-cloudformation"
       title="AWS Fargate launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for AWS Fargate launch type:

       1. Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
          ```

          <Callout variant="tip">
            For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
          </Callout>
       2. Add the `newrelic-infra` container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder `busybox` container.
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>

Next steps:

* Wait a few minutes and then [look for your data in the UI](/docs/ecs-integration-understand-use-data).
* Recommended: Install our [ECS cloud integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration), which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services.
* See [recommended alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions).
* Understand the [AWS resources](#aws-resources) created by this process.

## Install with automatic script [#auto-script-install]

One [install option](#install-overview) is using our install script. To use the automatic install script:

1. Download the ECS integration installer:

   ```
   curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh
   ```
2. Add execute permissions to the installer:

   ```
   chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh
   ```
3. Execute it with `-h` to see the documentation and requirements:

   ```
   ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h
   ```
4. Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created:

   ```
   $ aws configure get region
   us-east-1

   $ aws ecs list-clusters
   YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS 	
   arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER
   ```
5. Execute the installer, specifying your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and cluster name.

   EC2 launch type:

   ```
   ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
   ```

   EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:

   ```
   ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -e
   ```

   AWS Fargate launch type:

   ```
   ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -f -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
   ```
6. Additional steps for [Fargate launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) (not EC2 launch type):

   * Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

     ```
     curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
     ```

     <Callout variant="tip">
       For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
     </Callout>

      Notice that the just created `NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole` needs to be used as the task execution role.
      Policies attached to the role (All launch types):
        - NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key.
        - AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

   * Then, you can add the container you want to monitor as a sidecar.
      

Next steps:

* Wait a few minutes and then [look for your data in the UI](/docs/ecs-integration-understand-use-data).
* Recommended: Install our [ECS cloud integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration), which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services.
* See [recommended alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions).
* Understand the [AWS resources](#aws-resources) created by this process.

## Manual install

One [install option](#install-overview) is to manually do the steps that are done by the [automatic installer script](#auto-script-install). We will describe how this is done using the `awscli` tool:

1. Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created:

   ```
   $ aws configure get region
   us-east-1

   $ aws ecs list-clusters
   YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS
   arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER
   ```
2. Save your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter:

   ```
   aws ssm put-parameter \
     --name "/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key" \
     --type SecureString \
     --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \
     --value "NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY"
   ```
3. Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter:

   ```
   aws iam create-policy \
   	--policy-name "NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess" \
    --policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}" \
   	--description "Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter"
   ```
4. Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role:

   ```
   aws iam create-role \
     --role-name "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole" \
     --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2008-10-17","Statement":[{"Sid":"","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"},"Action":"sts:AssumeRole"}]}' \
     --description "ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure"
   ```
5. Attach the policies `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess`, and `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` to the role:

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy \
     	--role-name "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole" \
     	--policy-arn "POLICY_ARN"
   ```
6. Choose your launch type for more instructions:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="manual-ec2"
       title="EC2 and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for EC2 launch type:

       1. Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json
          ```
       2. Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role:

          ```
          "executionRoleArn": "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole",
          ```
       3. Replace the `valueFrom` attribute of the `secret` with the name of the Systems Manager parameter:

          ```
          secrets": [
            {
              "valueFrom": "/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key",
              "name": "NRIA_LICENSE_KEY"
            }
          ],
          ```
       4. Register the task definition file:

          ```
          aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json
          ```
       5. Create a service with the [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy for the registered task:

          For EC2 launch type:

          ```
          aws ecs create-service --cluster "YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" --service-name "newrelic-infra" --task-definition "newrelic-infra" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON --launch-type EC2
          ```

          For EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:

          ```
          aws ecs create-service --cluster "YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" --service-name "newrelic-infra-external" --task-definition "newrelic-infra" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON --launch-type EXTERNAL
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="manual-fargate"
       title="AWS Fargate launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for the AWS Fargate launch type:

       1. Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
          ```

          <Callout variant="tip">
            For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
          </Callout>

       2. Add the `newrelic-infra` container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder `busybox` container.
     </Collapser>

Next steps:

* Wait a few minutes and then [look for your data in the UI](/docs/ecs-integration-understand-use-data).
* Recommended: Install our [ECS cloud integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration), a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services.
* See [recommended alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions).
* Understand the [AWS resources](#aws-resources) created by this process.

<InstallFeedback />

## AWS resources created [#aws-resources]

When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS:

* Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter `/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key`. This system parameter contains the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
* Creates IAM policy `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess`, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key.
* Creates IAM role `NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole` used as the [task execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html). Policies attached to the role:
  * `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess` (created by the installer).
  * `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`
* Registers the `newrelic-infra` ECS task definition for EC2 and External (ECS Anywhere) launch types.
* For EC2 [launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html), this is also done:
  * Creates the service `newrelic-infra` for the registered task using a [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy and EC2 launch type.
* For EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) [launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html), this is also done:
  * Creates the service `newrelic-infra-external` for the registered task using a [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type.
