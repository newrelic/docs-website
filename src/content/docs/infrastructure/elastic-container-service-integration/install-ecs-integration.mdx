New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment.

## Install overview [#overview]

Before you [install](#install-options), it may help you to understand at a high level how our infrastructure agent (`newrelic-infra`) is deployed for these two launch types: 

* **EC2 and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:** Our agent gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy ([explained here in the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html)). This installs the agent in all EC2 instances of the cluster, and it then monitors ECS and Docker containers.
* **AWS Fargate launch type:** In every task to monitor, our agent gets deployed as a sidecar. Optional: [learn more about how AWS defines a sidecar](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nginx-reverse-proxy-sidecar-container-on-amazon-ecs).

## Install options [#install-options]

Choose the install you want: 

* [Install using AWS CloudFormation](#cloud-formation-install)
* [Install using automatic script](#auto-script-install)
* [Install manually](#manual-install)

## Install using CloudFormation [#cloud-formation-install]

To help you install using AWS CloudFormation, we provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for EC2, EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) and AWS Fargate launch types. 

To install using CloudFormation:

1. To register the ECS integration task, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/task/master.yaml&stackName=NewRelicECSIntegration). Ensure you're deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources:
   * A secret that stores the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
   * A policy to access the license key.
   * An instance role to be used as an ECS task `ExecutionRole`, with access to the license key.
   * For EC2 and External (ECS Anywhere) launch type: Registers the New Relic infrastructure ECS integration task.
2. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="ec2-cloudformation"
       title="EC2 launch type"
     >
       To create a service that runs the task on every EC2 container instance, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/service.yaml&NewRelicInfraTaskVersion=1).

       Select EC2 Launch type. Then a Service named `newrelic-infra` will be created in the cluster.
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="external-cloudformation"
       title="External (ECS Anywhere) launch type"
     >
       To create a service that runs the task on every external container instance, deploy [this stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://nr-downloads-main.s3.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/cloudformation/service.yaml&NewRelicInfraTaskVersion=1).

       Select EXTERNAL Launch type. Then a Service named `newrelic-infra-external` will be created in the cluster.
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="fargate-cloudformation"
       title="AWS Fargate launch type"
     >
       1. Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
          ```

          <Callout variant="tip">
            For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
          </Callout>
       2. Add the `newrelic-infra` container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder `busybox` container.
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>

When you're done, see [Next steps](#next-steps).

## Install with automatic script [#auto-script-install]

One [install option](#install-overview) is using our install script. To use the automatic install script:

1. Download the ECS integration installer:

   ```
   curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh
   ```
2. Add execute permissions to the installer:

   ```
   chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh
   ```
3. Execute it with `-h` to see the documentation and requirements:

   ```
   ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h
   ```
4. Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created:

   ```
   $ aws configure get region
   us-east-1

   $ aws ecs list-clusters
   YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS 	
   arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER
   ```
5. Execute the installer, specifying your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and cluster name.

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="auto-script-ec2"
       title="EC2 launch type"
     >
      ```
      ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
      ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
       id="auto-script-external"
       title="External (ECS Anywhere) launch type"
     > 
      ```
      ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -e
      ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
       id="auto-script-fargate"
       title="AWS Fargate launch type"
     > 

    ```
    ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -f -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
    ```
    </Collapser>  
  </CollapserGroup>

6. Additional steps for the Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type):

   * Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

     ```
     curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
     ```

     <Callout variant="tip">
       For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
     </Callout>

      Notice that the just created `NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole` needs to be used as the task execution role.
      Policies attached to the role (All launch types):
        - NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key.
        - AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

   * Then, you can add the container you want to monitor as a sidecar.
      
When you're done, see [Next steps](#next-steps).


## Manual install

One [install option](#install-overview) is to manually do the steps that are done by the [automatic installer script](#auto-script-install). We will describe how this is done using the `awscli` tool:

1. Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created:

   ```
   $ aws configure get region
   us-east-1

   $ aws ecs list-clusters
   YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS
   arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER
   ```
2. Save your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter:

   ```
   aws ssm put-parameter \
     --name "/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key" \
     --type SecureString \
     --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \
     --value "NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY"
   ```
3. Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter:

   ```
   aws iam create-policy \
   	--policy-name "NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess" \
    --policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}" \
   	--description "Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter"
   ```
4. Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role:

   ```
   aws iam create-role \
     --role-name "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole" \
     --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2008-10-17","Statement":[{"Sid":"","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"},"Action":"sts:AssumeRole"}]}' \
     --description "ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure"
   ```
5. Attach the policies `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess`, and `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` to the role:

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy \
     	--role-name "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole" \
     	--policy-arn "POLICY_ARN"
   ```
6. Choose your launch type for more instructions:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="manual-ec2"
       title="EC2 and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for EC2 launch type:

       1. Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json
          ```
       2. Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role:

          ```
          "executionRoleArn": "NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole",
          ```
       3. Replace the `valueFrom` attribute of the `secret` with the name of the Systems Manager parameter:

          ```
          secrets": [
            {
              "valueFrom": "/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key",
              "name": "NRIA_LICENSE_KEY"
            }
          ],
          ```
       4. Register the task definition file:

          ```
          aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json
          ```
       5. Create a service with the [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy for the registered task:

          For EC2 launch type:

          ```
          aws ecs create-service --cluster "YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" --service-name "newrelic-infra" --task-definition "newrelic-infra" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON --launch-type EC2
          ```

          For EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type:

          ```
          aws ecs create-service --cluster "YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" --service-name "newrelic-infra-external" --task-definition "newrelic-infra" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON --launch-type EXTERNAL
          ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="manual-fargate"
       title="AWS Fargate launch type"
     >
       Additional steps for the AWS Fargate launch type:

       1. Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed:

          ```
          curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json
          ```

          <Callout variant="tip">
            For Graviton, replace `"cpuArchitecture": "X86_64"` with `"cpuArchitecture": "ARM64"`.
          </Callout>

       2. Add the `newrelic-infra` container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder `busybox` container.

## Next steps after install [#next-steps]

After you've installed this integration: 

* Wait a few minutes and then [look for your data in the UI](/docs/ecs-integration-understand-use-data).
* Recommended: Install our [ECS cloud integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration), which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services.
* See [recommended alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions).
* Understand the [AWS resources](#aws-resources) created by this process.

## AWS resources created [#aws-resources]

When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS:

* Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter `/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key`. This system parameter contains the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
* Creates IAM policy `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess`, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key.
* Creates IAM role `NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole` used as the [task execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html). Policies attached to the role:
  * `NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess` (created by the installer).
  * `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`
* Registers the `newrelic-infra` ECS task definition for EC2 and External (ECS Anywhere) launch types.
* For EC2 [launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html), this is also done:
  * Creates the service `newrelic-infra` for the registered task using a [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy and EC2 launch type.
* For EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) [launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html), this is also done:
  * Creates the service `newrelic-infra-external` for the registered task using a [daemon scheduling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) strategy and EXTERNAL (ECS Anywhere) launch type.
