Our ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) environment. The ECS integration works well with other integrations, so you can also [monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Features

[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) (ECS) is a scalable container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on Amazon EC2 clusters. Our ECS integration instruments the underlying container instance (EC2 launch type) and the container layer by reporting metrics from ECS objects. The integration gives you insight into your ECS instances, tasks, services, and containers.

Features include:

* View your data in pre-built dashboards for immediate insight into your ECS environment.
* Create your own queries and charts in the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) from automatically reported data.
* Create [alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions) on ECS data.
* Explore entities using the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic also offers an [ECS cloud integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration), which reports a different data set than our on-host integration. For complete ECS monitoring, we recommend enabling both integrations.

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Requirements:

* Amazon ECS container agent 1.21.0 or higher.
* Windows not supported.
* This integration uses our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure) and our [Docker instrumentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/docker-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure): applicable requirements and restrictions of those systems apply.

## Install

To install, see [Install integration](/docs/install-ecs-integration).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-ecs "Link opens in a new window.") and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.
