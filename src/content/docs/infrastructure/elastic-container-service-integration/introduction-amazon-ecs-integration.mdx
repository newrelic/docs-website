Our ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) environment using our infrastructure agent and Docker instrumentation. The ECS integration works well with other integrations, so you can also [monitor the services that are running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces. To do this, enable the [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream).

## Features [#features]

[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) (ECS) is a scalable container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on:

* Amazon EC2 clusters
* [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
* [ECS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/anywhere/)

Our ECS integration instruments the underlying container instance and the container layer by reporting metrics from ECS objects. The integration gives you insight into your ECS instances, tasks, services, and containers. To view cluster entities install [Amazon ECS/ECR monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration/).

Features include:

* View your data in pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> for immediate insight into your ECS environment.
* Create your own queries and charts in the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
* Create [alert conditions](/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions).
* Explore entities using our [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer).

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

Requirements:

* Amazon ECS container agent 1.21.0 or higher.
* Windows is not supported.
* This integration uses our [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure) and our [Docker instrumentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/docker-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure): applicable requirements and restrictions of those systems apply.

## Install [#install]

To install, see our [install integration docs](/docs/install-ecs-integration).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

This integration is open source software. This means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-ecs) and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.


## Monitor with APM language agents [#monitor-with-apm]

You can also set up the APM language agents to run in your ECS Fargate environment. For more details, please see the [APM Agent in ECS Setup Guide](/docs/infrastructure/elastic-container-service-integration/monitor-ecs-with-apm-agents).
