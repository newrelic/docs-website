New Relic's on-host [ECS integration](/docs/introduction-amazon-ecs-integration) reports and displays performance data from your [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html) environment. Here we explain how to find, understand, and use the data reported by this integration.

## View data [#find-data]

To view the ECS integration dashboard:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and select [**Explorer**](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).
2. On the left, search for ECS clusters, or type the name of your ECS cluster in the search bar.
3. To view a dashboard, select the entity name corresponding to your ECS cluster.

In addition to the pre-built dashboards, you can also create your own custom queries and charts using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder). To learn how to query this data, see [Understand data](#understand).

## Query your data [#understand]

Data reported by this integration is displayed in its [dashboards](#find-data) and is also available for [querying](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and the creation of custom charts and dashboards.

This integration reports an `EcsClusterSample` [event](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic), with attributes `clusterName`, `awsRegion`, `ecsLaunchType` and `arn`.

Other types of data that may be available for querying:

* [Infrastructure agent-reported events, including](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events) [Docker](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/docker-installation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure#docker-data)

All the events reported from an ECS cluster contain the attributes `ecsClusterName`, `ecsLaunchType` and `ecsClusterArn`.

Here's an example [NRQL query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) that returns the count of containers associated with each Docker image in an ECS cluster named `MyClusterName` created in `us-east-1`:

```
SELECT uniqueCount(containerId) 
  FROM ContainerSample 
  WHERE awsRegion = 'us-east-1' 
  AND ecsClusterName = 'MyClusterName' 
  FACET imageName SINCE 1 HOUR AGO
```
