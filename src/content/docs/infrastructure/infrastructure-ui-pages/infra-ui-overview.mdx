Our **Infrastructure** UI helps you efficiently understand the state of your infrastructure. We'll give you a summary of the main parts of the infrastructure UI.

## A: Overview [#overview] 

When you open the [infrastructure UI](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts), you start out on the [**Hosts** page](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-hosts-ui-page), which gives you an overview of the state of your system, and gives you many options for exploring your hosts in more detail. 

Other pages in the **Overview** section include: 

* **Kubernetes**: This data is reported by our [Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration), if enabled. 
* **Network**: This takes you to our [network performance monitoring UI](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/get-started/npm-introduction). 
* **Inventory**: Here you can check your infrastructure configuration for upgrades and configuration drift. [Learn more about the inventory UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure).
* **Events**: A timeline of important system activity in your infrastructure stack. [Learn more about the events UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change).

## B: Integrations [#integrations]

The **Integration** section of the UI includes telemetry from any infrastructure integrations you've set up. These integrations can include: 

* Cloud service integrations, including [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), and [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations) 
* Third-party services: our many infrastructure-related integrations, including Apache, Cassandra, StatsD, RabbitMQ, and many more. To browse and add these, go to the [**Add data** page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability?category=infrastructure-and-os) in the platform. 

## C: Settings [#settings] 

The **Settings** section of the UI helps you understand: 

* **Agents**: See details about the [infrastructure agents](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) installed in your system. 
* **Alerts**: See an overview of alerts in your system, with a focus on active incidents. [Learn more about infrastructure alerting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
