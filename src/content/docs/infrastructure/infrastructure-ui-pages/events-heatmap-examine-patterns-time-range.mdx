The events heatmap provides a snapshot of the infrastructure [events](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page) occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. The darker the color on the heatmap, the more events occurred during that time period.

By comparing the heatmap to the charts on the infrastructure page, you can quickly pinpoint issues in your ecosystem. For example, if a massive CPU spike occurs, you can click on the events heatmap for that time range to find the event that caused it. From there you can dive deeper to uncover the real issue.
