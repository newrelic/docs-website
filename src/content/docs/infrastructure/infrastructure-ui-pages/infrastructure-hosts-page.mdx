Use the **Hosts** page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts**, and click the **Classic** tab. Then, click any of the following tabs:

* **[System](#system-tab)**: Overview of your hosts' performance
* **[Network](#network-tab)**: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces
* **[Processes](#processes-tab)**: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes
* **[Storage](#storage-tab)**: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations
* **[Docker containers](#containers-tab)**: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers

## System tab

Here are the default graphs shown on the **Hosts** page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown <Icon name="fe-chevron-down"/>
for any chart.

* **CPU %**: On the **System** tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the `SystemSample` event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the [`cpuPercent`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#systemsample-cpu-percent) attribute is an aggregation of `cpuUserPercent`, `cpuSystemPercent`, `cpuIoWaitPercent` and `cpuStealPercent`.
* **Load average five minute**: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes.
* **Memory free %**: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes.

For explanations of different chart metrics, see [Default infrastructure attributes and events](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#systemsample-attributes).

Functions for adjusting chart data include:

* **Select different host groups:** Use the [host filter](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/filter-sets-organize-your-infrastructure-hosts).
* **Change time range:** Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart.
* **Change the number of elements on charts:** use the **Chart shows** dropdown.
* **Change data used to order hosts:** Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest `CPU user %` to lowest, or from lowest to highest `Disk free`.

### System tab functions

Here are some of the things you can do from the **System** tab:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Filter and group hosts
      </td>

      <td>
        Use [filter sets](/docs/infrastructure-organize-your-resources-scopes) to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use [group by](/docs/infrastructure-group-results-specific-attributes) to aggregate the results.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="health">
      <td>
        Understand host health
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the **Health** column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="events">
      <td>
        Find root causes of issues
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the **Events** heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see [Events heatmap](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/events-heatmap-examine-patterns-time-range).
      </td>

        Mouse over a chart, select <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
        and then **Create alert**.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="view-alert">
      <td>

        icon.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

### APM and infrastructure data [#apm]

If you have <InlinePopover type="apm" /> data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the **Hosts** page:

* Use the [hosts filter](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/filter-sets-organize-your-infrastructure-hosts) to filter on hosts running specific applications.
* In the host list below the charts, select the **Application** column to filter on specific applications.
* From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts.

<Callout variant="important">
  <InlinePopover type="apm" /> charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have **View query** or **Create alert** options like the other infrastructure charts do.
</Callout>

For more about using <InlinePopover type="apm" /> and infrastructure monitoring together, see [APM data in infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).

## Network tab

The **Network** page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second.

Details about individual interfaces can help you:

* Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected [filter sets](/docs/scopes-organize-your-infrastructure).
* Compare load balances between specific resources.
* Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts.
* Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period.

This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision.

From the **Network** tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The **Network** page includes an [**Events** heatmap](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/events-heatmap-examine-patterns-time-range), which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics.

For a technical explanation of the [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) used to populate the **Network** page chart, see [NetworkSample attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#networksample-attributes).

        icon or **Warning** <Icon name="fe-alert-triangle"/>
        icon.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Processes tab

<Callout variant="important">
  By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send [data about the operating system's processes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=ProcessSample) unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set [`enable_process_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/) to `true`. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure [`include_matching_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#include-matching-metrics).
</Callout>

Use the **Processes** tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The **Processes** tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes.

The page also includes an [events heatmap](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/events-heatmap-examine-patterns-time-range), which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to:

* Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues.
* Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage.

On the **Processes** page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking.

**Example**

Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert:

1. You notice on the [**Hosts** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage) that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal.
2. You go to the **Processes** page and filter down to that cluster's processes.
3. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage.
4. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold.

For a technical explanation of the [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) used to populate the **Processes** page chart, see [ProcessSample attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#processsample-attributes).

<Callout variant="tip">
  You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to [start, stop, check, or restart](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) the infrastructure agent manually.

## Storage tab

The **Storage** page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to:

* Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly.
* Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out.
* Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc.
* Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests.
* Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises.

The **Storage** page includes an [**Events** heatmap](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/events-heatmap-examine-patterns-time-range), which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics.

For a technical explanation of the [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) used to populate the Storage page chart, see [StorageSample attributes](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#storagesample-attributes).
