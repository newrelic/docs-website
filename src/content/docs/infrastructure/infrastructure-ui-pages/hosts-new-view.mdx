Use the **Hosts** page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

## Access the new infrastructure UI [#access-new-ui]

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts (New)**, and click the **Dashboard** tab.

## Filters and saved views [#filter]

Use the filter at the top of the page to find your host by using the suggested filters, or by typing its name or tags attached to it.

If you have any saved views for Infrastructure, you can access them through the **Saved views** button.

## Tabs

These are the available tabs in the **Hosts** page:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser

    title="Summary"
    >
    The **Summary** tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance.

    In the **Summary** table, you can see a list of your hosts.

    There are four tiles at the top of the page: Hosts, Applications, Events, and Alerting.

    ### Hosts
