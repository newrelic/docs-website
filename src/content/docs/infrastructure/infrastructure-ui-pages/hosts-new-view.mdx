Use the **Hosts** page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

## Access the new infrastructure UI [#access-new-ui]

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts (New)**.

## Filters and saved views [#filter]

Use the filter at the top of the page to find your host by using the suggested filters, or by typing its name or tags attached to it.

If you have any saved views for Infrastructure, you can access them through the <img src={infrastructureSavedViewsBttn} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "95px"}} alt="Saved views" title="Saved views" /> button.
