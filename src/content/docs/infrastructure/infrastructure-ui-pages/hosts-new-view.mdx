Use the **Hosts** page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

## Access the new infrastructure UI [#access-new-ui]

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts (New)**, and click the **Dashboard** tab.
