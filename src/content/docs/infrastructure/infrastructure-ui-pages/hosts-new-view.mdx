Use the **Hosts** page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts (New)**.

## Filters and saved views [#filter]

Use the filter at the top of the page to find your host by using the suggested filters, or by typing its name or tags attached to it.

If you have any saved views for Infrastructure, you can access them through the <img src={infrastructureSavedViewsBttn} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "70px"}} alt="Saved views" title="Saved views" /> button.

To save a view, `LINKTO_WHERE_USERS_SAVE_VIEWS`.

## Tabs

These are the available tabs in the **Hosts** page:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="summary"
    title="Summary"
    >
    The **Summary** tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance. Here are the graphs available in this tab:

    ### Insights

    In this section, you can see the total count of your hosts, applications, events, and alerts active in your system.

    ### Metrics

    * **CPU %**: it's a derived metric part of the `SystemSample` event. The CPU percentage isn't collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the [`cpuPercent`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#systemsample-cpu-percent) attribute is an aggregation of `cpuUserPercent`, `cpuSystemPercent`, `cpuIoWaitPercent` and `cpuStealPercent`.
    * **Memory used (%)**: the amount of memory used in a specific period of time.
    * **Disk used (%)**: the amount of disk used in a specific period of time.
    * **Disk utilization (%)**:
    * **Memory free (%)**: the amount of free memory in a specific period of time.
    * **Load average (5 min)**: an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes.
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="system"
    title="System"
    >
    The **System** tab gives you an overview of your system. Here are the graphs available in this tab:

    * **Disk reads per second**: 
    * **Load average 5 min**: an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes.
    * **Memory free**: the amount of free memory in a specific period of time.

    In the **System** table, you can filter your hosts by metric name. With the <img src={infrastructureExportCSV} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Export CSV" title="Export CSV" /> button, you can export this table as a CSV file.

    The **Processes** tab gives you data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes. Here are the graphs available in this tab:
    
    * **CPU %**: it's a derived metric part of the `SystemSample` event. The CPU percentage isn't collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the [`cpuPercent`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#systemsample-cpu-percent) attribute is an aggregation of `cpuUserPercent`, `cpuSystemPercent`, `cpuIoWaitPercent` and `cpuStealPercent`.
