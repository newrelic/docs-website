In our infrastructure monitoring UI, the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> UI page is the main place for you to understand and troubleshoot issues with your infrastructure.    

<Callout variant="tip">
  These docs describe the new <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> UI added in April of 2023. You can switch between the new view and the <DoNotTranslate>**Classic**</DoNotTranslate> view.
</Callout>

## An example use case [#use-case]

The <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> page is the place to go to investigate issues in your infrastructure. Here's one example of a common workflow our customers use to diagnose a problem: 

1. On the [APM summary page](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/triage-run-diagnostics), you notice an issue with your Kafka service. Throughput has dropped and many errors are present. 
2. Based on the infrastructure data you see in APM, you think it's a host issue so you click through to the infrastructure <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> page. 
3. The <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> page automatically filters to your Kafka service. You see that half of the hosts running that service have maxed out their CPU %. 
4. If you suspect a host configuration change could be the source of your issue, go to the <DoNotTranslate>**Inventory**</DoNotTranslate> tab and check your system's configurations per host.

## UI features for exploring and analyzing your hosts [#ui-features]

There are some important UI features available across the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> UI. Understanding how to use these will help you get the most out of this UI.

<img
  title="Infrastructure UI - Hosts UI options"
  alt="Infrastructure UI - Hosts UI options"
  src={infrastructureHostsUiOptions}
/>

* <DoNotTranslate>**A.**</DoNotTranslate> The filter bar: Filter for the hosts you want to see. For tips, see [Filter bar](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities).
* <DoNotTranslate>**B.**</DoNotTranslate> Saved views: When you create a view you like (which can include filters, and custom chart and table selections), click <DoNotTranslate>**Save**</DoNotTranslate>. 
* <DoNotTranslate>**C.**</DoNotTranslate> Chart options: You can switch to different metrics for each chart, and you can click `...` to see [more chart options](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform/#data-analysis), including getting a shareable link and creating an alert for that metric. 
* <DoNotTranslate>**D.**</DoNotTranslate> Group by: Use this to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, you might display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage grouped by `awsRegion`.
* <DoNotTranslate>**E.**</DoNotTranslate> Attribute filter: This lets you filter your hosts to those with a specific [attribute](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#attribute) value. For example, 
* <DoNotTranslate>**F.**</DoNotTranslate> Host table: By default, 25 hosts are selected for display. Use the table columns and the attribute filter to explore the hosts, and select different hosts for display. You can export the table as a CSV.
* <DoNotTranslate>**G.**</DoNotTranslate> Host details: For a specific host in the host table, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon to see more options to learn about it, including options for viewing logs, seeing an [entity map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps), and more. 

## Tabs on the hosts UI page [#host-views]

Here are more details about the tabs available on the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> UI page: 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="summary"
    title="Summary tab"
    >

On the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> page, the <DoNotTranslate>**Summary**</DoNotTranslate> tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance. 

<img
  title="Hosts Summary page"
  alt="Hosts Summary page"
  src={infrastructureHostsNewSummaryAnimated}
/>

<figcaption>
  <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DoNotTranslate>
</figcaption>

The tiles at the top of this page give you an overview of your hosts, applications, events, and alerts. Use these tiles to see more detail about a host or filter the entire <DoNotTranslate>**Summary**</DoNotTranslate> page to a specific host.

The time picker on the <DoNotTranslate>**Summary**</DoNotTranslate> page only adjusts the metrics tiles and charts but does **not** adjust the host table. The other tabs in the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> UI have tables that reflect the time range set by the time picker.  
</Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="system"
    title="System UI"
    >
The <DoNotTranslate>**System**</DoNotTranslate> tab gives you an overview of your system. It's somewhat similar to the <DoNotTranslate>**Summary**</DoNotTranslate> tab but allows you to search for more in-depth details about some aspects of your system. 

<img

<figcaption>
    <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts > System**</DoNotTranslate>
</figcaption>

Here are the default charts shown on the <DoNotTranslate>**System**</DoNotTranslate> page:

* <DoNotTranslate>**CPU %**</DoNotTranslate>: This is a metric derived from several other metrics on the `SystemSample` event. Specifically, the [`cpuPercent`](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#systemsample-cpu-percent) attribute is an aggregation of `cpuUserPercent`, `cpuSystemPercent`, `cpuIoWaitPercent` and `cpuStealPercent`.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Load average five minute**</DoNotTranslate>: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes.
* <DoNotTranslate>**Memory free %**</DoNotTranslate>: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes.

For details about the data used to generate these charts, see [SystemSample](attribute-dictionary/?event=SystemSample).

    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="network"
    title="Network UI"
    >
The <DoNotTranslate>**Network**</DoNotTranslate> page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second.

    <img
        title="Hosts Network page"
        alt="Hosts Network page"
        src={infrastructureHostNewNetwork}
    />

        <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts > Network**</DoNotTranslate>
    </figcaption>

Details about individual interfaces can help you:

* Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected hosts.
* Compare load balances between specific resources.
* Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts.
* Evaluate the top five network errors detected.

This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision.

For details about the data used to generate these charts, see [NetworkSample](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NetworkSample).

    <Collapser
    id="processes"
    title="Processes UI"
    >
<Callout variant="important">
  By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send [data about the operating system's processes](/attribute-dictionary/?event=ProcessSample) unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set [`enable_process_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings/) to `true`. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure [`include_matching_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#include-matching-metrics).
</Callout>

Use the <DoNotTranslate>**Processes**</DoNotTranslate> tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The <DoNotTranslate>**Processes**</DoNotTranslate> tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes.

    <img
        title="Hosts Processes page"
        alt="Hosts Processes page"

        <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts > Processes**</DoNotTranslate>
    </figcaption>

On the <DoNotTranslate>**Processes**</DoNotTranslate> tab, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking.

For details about the data used to generate these charts, see [ProcessSample](/attribute-dictionary/?event=ProcessSample).

Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert:

1. You notice on the <DoNotTranslate>**Hosts**</DoNotTranslate> page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal.
2. You go to the <DoNotTranslate>**Processes**</DoNotTranslate> page and filter down to that cluster's processes.
3. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage.
4. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to [start, stop, check, or restart](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status) the infrastructure agent manually.

        <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts > Storage**</DoNotTranslate>
    </figcaption>

The <DoNotTranslate>**Storage**</DoNotTranslate> tab allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to:

* Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly.
* Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out.
* Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc.
* Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests.
* Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises.

For details about the data used to generate these charts, see [StorageSample](/attribute-dictionary/?event=StorageSample).

    <Collapser
    id="containers"
    title="Containers"
    >
Use the <DoNotTranslate>**Containers**</DoNotTranslate> tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. This tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. Use this information to:

* Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues.
* Create <InlinePopover type="alerts" /> for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage.
