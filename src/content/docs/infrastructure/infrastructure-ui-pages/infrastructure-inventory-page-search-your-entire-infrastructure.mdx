New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, and more. The <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration.

Use the <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page to:

* Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts.
* Audit version discrepancies across your hosts.
* Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability.

## Find the inventory page [#find]

To view and search your inventory data: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Inventory**</DNT>.

## What data does this page display? [#data]

For data to appear on this page, you must have [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) installed.

## Inventory item naming [#item-naming]

The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements:

<img
  title="Source path.png"
  alt="Inventory source path"
  src="/images/infrastructure_screenshot-full_inventory-name-source-path.webp"
/>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Element
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Category
      </td>

      <td>
        Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Source
      </td>

      <td>
        The specific data source for the inventory item.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Label
      </td>

      <td>
        The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          Use [tagging](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor#attributes) for detailed metadata and other information about your hosts .
        </Callout>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Page functions [#page-functions]

Use <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="search"
    title="Search inventory"
  >
    Search for an inventory item using the search function.

    For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search `openssl`. The search term is matched against the inventory item name.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you want to find the Fluent Bit version being used on your system, in the **Search Inventory** search box, enter `fluent-bit`, then click **>** to expand the search results.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="view"
    title="View inventory item details"
  >
    Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic [inventory item name](#item-naming). If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the <DNT>**variant hosts**</DNT> label and lists each host running each version.

    Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item.

    Common inventory item attributes include:

    * Variant hosts (hostname)
    * Architecture
    * Description
    * Essential
    * Priority
    * Status
    * Version
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="alerts"
    title="View host's alert threshold incidents"
  >
    To view one or more host's [alert threshold incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold), select the host's <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> <Icon name="fe-x-circle"/>
    icon or <DNT>**Warning**</DNT> <Icon name="fe-alert-triangle"/>
    icon.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Inventory data collection [#data-collection]

Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations. The data appears on the <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page and in other places in our infrastructure UI.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="linux"
    title="Linux built-in agent data"

## Inventory data retention [#data-retention]

Inventory data is real-time. If a host stops reporting, its inventory data still displays for up to 24 hours.

## Chart data attributes [#attributes]

For a technical explanation about attributes used to populate the <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> page, see [Default infrastructure attributes and events](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#shared-attributes). This includes a summary of [common events by operating system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-attributes-events#events-os).

## Filter sets [#filter-sets]

The filter set UI component is used for filtering your hosts and creating saved views. <DNT>**It is only available on the Events and Inventory UI pages and is in the process of being deprecated.**</DNT> It has been replaced by the [saved views](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-hosts-ui-page#ui-features) feature. Any filter sets you create from this point onward will not be migrated to the saved views feature.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="filter-set"
    title="How to use filter sets"
  >
    With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can combine filters into a filter set to organize hosts based on criteria that matter the most to you. Your account may have hundreds of hosts reporting to it, so focusing on what's important is crucial for being able to troubleshoot effectively.

    ### See patterns within categories [#benefits]

    You can create filter sets using available [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) or [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).

    For example, you can organize your infrastructure into categories such as:

    * Regions
    * Operating system versions
    * Hosts associated with Docker containers
    * Test environments

    You can share filter sets with other people in your account, and you can quickly identify infrastructure problems by checking the color-coded [health status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) of each host in the filter set.

    ### Create filter sets [#create]

    The default infrastructure filter set is <DNT>**All hosts**</DNT>, and it serves as a template for you to create filter sets.

    To create a filter set:

    1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT> and click <DNT>**Inventory**</DNT> or <DNT>**Events**</DNT>.
    2. If <DNT>**All hosts**</DNT> is not displayed in the left sidebar, open that filter set by selecting <DNT>**Saved filter sets > All hosts**</DNT>.
    3. In <DNT>**All hosts**</DNT>, click <DNT>**Filter hosts**</DNT>.
    4. In the list, click an item to see a list of values.
    5. Click <DNT>**Include**</DNT> or <DNT>**Exclude**</DNT> (see [Filter set logic](#logic)).
    6. Click values individually or enter text to match multiple values.
    7. Continue adding filters until you have the filter set you want.
    8. To name your filter, click the <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       icon, type a name, and click <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

    ### Edit filter sets [#edit]

    To change an existing filter set:

    1. In the sidebar, click <DNT>**Saved filter sets**</DNT> to open a list.
    2. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term.
    3. Click the filter set to open it.
    4. In the sidebar, click an option to update your filter set, and then save.

    ### Filter set logic [#logic]

    When you create a filter set, you generate a list of attributes and/or tags that narrow the results. This section explains how filter sets apply various rules to the list.

    #### Inclusion and exclusion [#include-exclude]

    As part of building a filter set, you designate whether a filter should include or exclude entities that match certain values.

    The way the inclusion or exclusion works depends on how you select values:

        You can generate a list of values by entering a string that you want values to match. This is useful for matching multiple values.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          String matching efficiently generates a list of values, and this approach scales as you add new entities.
        </Callout>

        Here is the logic filter sets use with string matching:

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
                Comparator
              </th>

              <th>
                Logic
              </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Include
              </td>

              <td>
                If you click <DNT>**Include**</DNT> and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator `LIKE`, which means the results include any entities that are like the string.

                For example, you could filter by the term East-, and all entities that contain that term are returned.
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                Exclude
              </td>

              <td>
                If you click <DNT>**Exclude**</DNT> and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator `NOT LIKE`, which means the results exclude any entities that are like the string.

                For example, you could filter by the term West-, and all entities that do not contain that term are returned.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="select-individually"
        title="Select values individually"
      >
        You can click through the list of attributes/tags to identify individual values.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          This approach does not scale well if you add new entities.
        </Callout>

        Here is the logic filter sets use with individual value selection:

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
                Comparator
              </th>

              <th>
                Logic
              </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Include
              </td>

              <td>
                If you click <DNT>**Include**</DNT> and then click specific values, the filter uses the comparator `IN`, which means the filter looks for entities that exactly match one or more values in your list of selections.
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                Exclude
              </td>

              <td>
                If you click <DNT>**Exclude**</DNT> and then click specific values, the filter set uses the comparator `NOT IN`, which means the filter returns all entities that do not exactly match one or more values in your list of selections.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    #### And/Or

    Filter sets use the logical operators `AND` and `OR` behind the scenes to join the data.

    * When you click values from multiple attributes or tags, they are joined by `AND`.
    * When you click values from within an attribute or tags, they are joined by `OR`.

    The filter results display hosts for which both of the following are true:

    * Hosts containing any one of the selected infrastructure agent versions
    * Hosts in any one of the selected AWS availability zones
