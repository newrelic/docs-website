In New Relic's infastructure monitoring, the **Events** UI page is a live feed of important system and host activity, including inventory change events, configuration changes, and log analytics events. The event feed helps you understand correlations between these events and system performance. Search and filter through your events to decrease the mean time to detect and repair infrastructure issues.

<Callout variant="tip">
Note that this use of "event" is specific to infrastructure monitoring and a separate concept from our more general [event data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
</Callout>

You can access the **Events** page by going to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > Events**.

## Event types [#types]

New Relic collects a variety of change events so you can understand each change in your environment:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Events**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Alert incidents
      </td>

      <td>
        When a [violation](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-violation) is opened or closed, New Relic generates an event indicating the host and associated [alert condition](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Agent connection
      </td>

      <td>
        When an infrastructure [agent](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#agent) connects to New Relic, our platform generates an **Agent connected** event. If New Relic doesn't receive data from an agent for three minutes, the platform generates an **Agent disconnected** event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Inventory changes
      </td>

      <td>
        These events are generated when [inventory](/docs/infrastructure-inventory-page) data is added, removed, or modified. Select the source <Icon name="fe-filter"/>
        icon to to understand which category corresponds to the altered inventory path. For additional details, select an inventory event to see a side-by-side comparison of the old and new state.

        Inventory events can include:

        * **Kernel** (includes modules and configuration): Can be added, modified, or deleted.
        * **Metadata** (includes various additional information about hosts): Can be added, modified, or deleted.
        * **Packages**: Can be installed, removed, or modified.
        * **Services**: Can be started, stopped, or restarted.
        * **Sessions** (includes users): Can be connected or disconnected.
      </td>

## Events page features [#search]

To view the live event feed: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > Events**. The **Events** page includes a [heatmap](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/events-heatmap-examine-patterns-time-range), which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the selected time range.
