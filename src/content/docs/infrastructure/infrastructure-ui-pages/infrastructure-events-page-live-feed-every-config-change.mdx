In our infrastructure monitoring UI, the <DoNotTranslate>**Events**</DoNotTranslate> UI page is a live feed of important system and host activity, including inventory change events, configuration changes, and log analytics events. The event feed helps you understand correlations between these events and system performance. Search and filter through your events to decrease the mean time to detect and repair infrastructure issues.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that `event` here has an infrastructure-specific meaning that is different from our [event data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
</Callout>

Find the <DoNotTranslate>**Events**</DoNotTranslate> page by going to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Events**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Event timeline [#event-timeline]

The events chart provides a snapshot of the infrastructure [events](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page) occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. On hover you can see the number of events per color coded category to investigate any anomalous spikes.

</figcaption>

By comparing the timeline to the charts on the infrastructure page, you can quickly pinpoint issues in your ecosystem. For example, if a massive CPU spike occurs, you can click on the events timeline for that time range to find the event that caused it. From there you can dive deeper to uncover the real issue.

## Event types [#types]

New Relic collects a variety of change events so you can understand each change in your environment:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        <DoNotTranslate>**Events**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>

      <th>
        <DoNotTranslate>**Comments**</DoNotTranslate>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Alert incidents
      </td>

      <td>
        When an [incident](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident) is opened or closed, New Relic generates an event indicating the host and associated [alert condition](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Agent connection
      </td>

      <td>
        When an infrastructure [agent](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#agent) connects to New Relic, our platform generates an <DoNotTranslate>**Agent connected**</DoNotTranslate> event. If New Relic doesn't receive data from an agent for three minutes, the platform generates an <DoNotTranslate>**Agent disconnected**</DoNotTranslate> event.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Inventory changes
      </td>

      <td>
        These events are generated when [inventory](/docs/infrastructure-inventory-page) data is added, removed, or modified. Select the source <Icon name="fe-filter"/>
        icon to to understand which category corresponds to the altered inventory path. For additional details, select an inventory event to see a side-by-side comparison of the old and new state.

        Inventory events can include:

        * <DoNotTranslate>**Kernel**</DoNotTranslate> (includes modules and configuration): Can be added, modified, or deleted.
        * <DoNotTranslate>**Metadata**</DoNotTranslate> (includes various additional information about hosts): Can be added, modified, or deleted.
        * <DoNotTranslate>**Packages**</DoNotTranslate>: Can be installed, removed, or modified.
        * <DoNotTranslate>**Services**</DoNotTranslate>: Can be started, stopped, or restarted.
        * <DoNotTranslate>**Sessions**</DoNotTranslate> (includes users): Can be connected or disconnected.
