You may be part of a cloud-based DevOps team or a traditional tech ops team in a network operations center. Either way, you need a single platform with integrated tools and a comprehensive set of telemetry data to quickly manage all your systems.

Our infrastructure monitoring solution provides both depth and breadth of open-source options. And our unique Kubernetes cluster explorer simplifies your complex environment. The multidimensional view helps you dive deeper into your related application metrics, container logs, and Kubernetes events.

Using any of our hosted or containerized agents, integrations, APIs, and SDKs, you can quickly:

* Observe relationships between the health and performance of your infrastructure and application components.
* Proactively detect and troubleshoot escalating incidents, so you can resolve outages and other problems.
* Identify root causes behind issues across your systems.
* Manage the stability, scalability, and reliability of your systems.
* Reduce MTTD and MTTR across your infrastructure in any environment.

**Troubleshoot and resolve problems.**

* Use [alerts](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-alerts) and [Applied Intelligence](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai) for key performance indicators.
* Examine issues by using the [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui).
* Correlate your apps, related services, alerts, logs, and overall digital customer experience with our [Kubernetes cluster explorer](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/kubernetes-cluster-explorer) and [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

**Visualize your data.**

* [Query](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) any data type (including [metrics, events, logs, and traces](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types)) via UI or API.
* Create and share a variety of [charts and dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) that include customer context with business priorities and expected outcomes.
* Examine [dimensional metrics](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql) from multiple entities, from a single customer.
