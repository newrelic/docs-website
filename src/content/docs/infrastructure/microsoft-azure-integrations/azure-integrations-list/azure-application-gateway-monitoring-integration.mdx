[New Relic includes an integration](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) for reporting your Azure App Gateway data to our platform. Here we explain how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Activate the integration [#activate]

To enable the integration follow standard procedures to [activate your Azure service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/azure-integration-polling) information for the Azure App Gateway integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > Azure** and select an integration.

Data is attached to the following [event type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
