[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Microsoft Azure Media Services Live Events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/live-event-streaming-best-practices-guide) metrics and other data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

New Relic gathers metrics data from Azure Monitor for the Azure Media Services Live Events. Azure Media Services Live Events is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables live video and audio streaming for various events such as conferences, webinars, concerts and sports events. It allows users to capture, encode, package, and deliver live video content to audiences worldwide via the internet.  


Using New Relic, you can:

* View Azure Media Services Live Events data in pre-built dashboards.
* Run [custom queries and visualize the data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights).
* Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

Follow standard [Azure Monitor integration procedure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor) to activate your Azure service in New Relic Infrastructure.


## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings).

New Relic queries your Azure Media Services Live Events through Azure Monitor integration according to a default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings) interval.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To [explore your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]
