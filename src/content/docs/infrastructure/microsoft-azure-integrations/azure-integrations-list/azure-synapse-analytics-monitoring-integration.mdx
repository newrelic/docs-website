title: Azure Synapse Analytics service through Azure Monitor integration
metaDescription: "New Relic's Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics integration: what data it reports and how to enable it."
---

[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/synapse-analytics/) metrics and other data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

Azure Synapse Analytics is an enterprise analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. It brings together the best of SQL technologies used in enterprise data warehousing, Apache Spark technologies for big data, and Azure Data Explorer for log and time series analytics.

Using New Relic, you can:

* View Azure Synapse Analytics data in pre-built dashboards.
* Run [custom queries and visualize the data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights).
* Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

Follow standard [Azure Monitor integration procedure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor) to activate your Azure service in New Relic infrastructure monitoring.

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings).

New Relic queries your Azure Synapse Analytics services through the Azure Monitor integration according to a default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings) interval.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To [explore your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to **[one.newrelic.com/infra](https://one.newrelic.com/infra) > Azure > (select an integration)**.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following [metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#metric):
