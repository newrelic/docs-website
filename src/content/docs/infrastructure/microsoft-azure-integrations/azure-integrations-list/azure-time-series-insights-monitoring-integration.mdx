title: Azure Time Series Insights service through Azure Monitor integration
metaDescription: "New Relic's Microsoft Azure Time Series Insights integration: what data it reports and how to enable it."
---

[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Microsoft Azure Time Series Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/time-series-insights/) metrics and other data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

New Relic gathers metrics data from Azure Monitor for the Azure Time Series Insights service. Azure Time Series Insights can easily scale up or down based on the amount of data being ingested and queried. This ensures that you have the resources you need to handle any spikes in data volume.

Using New Relic, you can:

* View Azure Time Series Insights data in pre-built dashboards.
* Run [custom queries and visualize the data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-Insight).
* Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data.

## Activate integration [#activate]

Follow standard [Azure Monitor integration procedure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor) to activate your Azure service in New Relic infrastructure monitoring.

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings).

New Relic queries your Azure Time Series Insight services through the Azure Monitor integration according to a default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor/#settings) interval.

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To [explore your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to **[one.newrelic.com/infra](https://one.newrelic.com/infra) > Azure > (select an integration)**. 

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following [metric data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#metric).
