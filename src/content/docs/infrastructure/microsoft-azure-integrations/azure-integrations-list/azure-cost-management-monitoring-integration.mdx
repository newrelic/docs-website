[New Relic's integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your [Microsoft Azure Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/) data to New Relic. Here we explain how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Features

New Relic's Azure Cost Management integration collects your accumulated monthly expenditures for the Azure resources in your subscription, grouped by service, location, resource group, or tag.

Our integration allows you to track how costs evolve for each billing period and detect unexpected trends, or alert on accumulated costs for the current billing period.

## Activate integration [#requirements]

Follow standard procedures to [activate your Azure service in New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations).

In some cases, the Azure Cost Management integration requires you to add an additional role to fetch billing data:

1. In the Azure Portal <DNT>**Subscriptions**</DNT> section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor.
2. Select <DNT>**Access control (IAM) > Add**</DNT>.
3. From the <DNT>**Role**</DNT> dropdown, select <DNT>**Billing Reader**</DNT>.
4. From the <DNT>**Select**</DNT> dropdown, select the app's name; for example, `NewRelic-Integrations`.
5. From <DNT>**Selected members**</DNT>, verify your app name appears, then select <DNT>**Save**</DNT>.

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Azure Cost Management integration:

* Default polling frequency: 1 hour
* Maximum recommended polling frequency: 1 hour
* Resolution: 1 day

## Find and use data [#find-and-use]

To find your integration data, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure**</DNT> and look for the integration.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `AzureCostManagementSample` event type. The `provider` metadata value indicates how the daily cost is grouped:

* `AzureCostLocation`: Costs are grouped by location.
* `AzureCostService`: Costs are grouped by cloud service.
* `AzureCostResourceGroup`: Costs are grouped by resource group.
* `AzureCostTag`: Costs are grouped by a resource tag, indicated in the `label.<tag_key>` metadata of the same event. Untagged resources will not be collected. In order to collect costs grouped by tag, specify the tag key in the integration settings.

Costs are estimates, as Microsoft can make updates to the cost data up until the invoice for the billing period is generated. To get the most accurate value of the accumulated cost in the billing period, use the [`max()` function](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#func-max) in your NRQL queries.

## Event data [#metrics]

Here are the metrics and metadata reported by the Azure Cost Management integration. For more information about how data is structured and reported to New Relic, see [Understand and use integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#metric).
