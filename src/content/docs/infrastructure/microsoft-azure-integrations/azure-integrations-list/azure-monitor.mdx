Monitor and report data about your Microsoft Azure services to New Relic with the New Relic Azure Monitor integration. 

Our Azure Monitor integartion improves upon our past Azure solutions;
- Coverage: New metrics will be available the moment Azure adds it to their Azure Monitor API endpoints, including data from new Azure services.
- Always up-to-date: Any improvement in existing metrics will show up in New Relic automatically.
- Faster metrics: The new integration enables customers to define up to 1 polling interval reducing the average time-to-ingest for most Azure Monitor namespaces.

## Features

Monitor all your Azure metrics from all supported Azure services with our Azure Monitor integration.

Once you enable the New Relic Azure Monitor integration, New Relic queries your Azure platform services according to the configured polling interval. This enables all of the following features:

- Metric ingestion from [all Azure services supported by Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported)
- Native [dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics-new-relic) experience for queries, alerts and data explorer.
- Azure [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) in the [New Relic explorer](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) with golden metrics and built-in dashboards.
- Metrics decorated with custom tags defined in Azure resources
- Faster [polling intervals](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/polling-intervals-azure-integrations/) available (up to `1min`), enabling faster time-to-glass for metrics
- Ability to filter monitored resources by group, type and tags

## Why Azure Monitor over traditional Azure integrations?
Before the Azure Monitor integration, monitoring azure required service-specific Azure APIs to retreive metrics and metadata.  

In contrast, the new **Azure Monitor** integration retrieves all [available Azure Monitor metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported), enhancing our Azure support and accelerating the availability of new Azure services and metrics.  

The following table shows the differences between both solutions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Traditional Azure integrations</th>
      <th>New Azure Monitor integration</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
		A separate integration with each Azure service is required to collect metrics and metadata.
      </td>
      <td>
		Our single Azure Monitor integration is able to collect metrics and metadata from a large and ever-growing list of resources supported by Azure Monitor.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
		Adding support for new Azure services requires building and maintaining a new integration.
      </td>
      <td>
		Data from new services supported by Azure Monitor is available in New Relic at once.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
      <td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Requirements

The Azure integration activation process requires you to:

- A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required.
- Create a New Relic application and key in Azure.
- Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor.
- Place required information in the Integrations UI.

## Cost considerations [#cost-considerations]

Consider the following when evaluating the costs of the **Azure Monitor** integration with New Relic:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="azure"
    title="Microsoft Azure costs"
  >

Given that the new integration enables ingesting all metrics from all services, **the amount of API calls to Azure will depend on the number of resources that are monitored by New Relic**. Configuration of the integration's polling interval parameters can help controlling the amount of these API calls.

Review [Microsoft Azure Monitor pricing documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/monitor/#pricing) for additional detail.

Rate limits as enforced by Azure will be shared between any current polling integrations that exist from within other New Relic Azure integrations.

**Standard data ingest costs apply**, based on your New Relic pricing plan. Multiple controls exist to control the amount of data being ingested, including inclusion/exclusion filters and [data dropping rules](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/).

## Setting up the Azure Monitor integration

1. See the [Activate Azure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/activate-azure-integrations/) documentation. Then the **Azure Monitor** integration will be visible to set up in the Azure integrations tab.
2. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to begin collecting data for your app.

/>


Once you activate the integration, we recommend: 

- Start by validating and testing the new integration on testing environments first.
- Review the [integration settings](#integration-settings) section to adjust polling intervals and filters based on your observability requirements.
- Start with those resource types that were not previously supported by New Relic with traditional Azure integration.


Note that the Azure Monitor integration and other Azure integration can be enabled in parallel. See the [querying your data](#Querying-Your-Data) section to learn how to query Azure Monitor metrics in isolation

## Integration settings

Polling frequency:
- `Metrics polling interval`: how often will New Relic fetch metrics from your resources through Azure Monitor
- `Metadata and tags polling interval`: how often will New Relic fetch metadata and tags from your Azure resources through Azure Monitor

Data collection and filters:

- `Limit to resource types`: only fetch data from resources matching specified resource type(s) (if enabled and not empty)
- `Limit to resource group`: only fetch data from resources matching specified resource group(s) (if enabled and not empty)
- `Resource tags to include`: only fetch data from resources tagged with specified tag(s) (if enabled and not empty)
- `Resouce tags to exclude`: drop data from resources tagged with specified tag(s) (highest precedence)


## Out of the box support
<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="query"
    title="Querying your data"
  >

Metrics collected using the Azure Monitor:
- Are stored in New Relic as [dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) of type `summary`.
- Can be [queried](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-infrastructure-dimensional-metrics-nrql/) using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).
- Are available as raw dimensional metrics when not mapped to an entity.

In order to ease migration to the Azure Monitor integration, you can continue to use the queries and metric naming from the traditional Azure integrations.

All Azure Monitor metrics will have these attributes:

-   `collector.name`: `azure-monitor`
-   `instrumentation.provider`: `azure`
-   `azure.region`
-   `azure.resourceId`
-   `azure.resourceType`
-   `azure.resourceId`
  
  For example, to see the amount of metric updates received from Azure Monitor in the last hour, you can run this query:

```
FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE collector.name = 'azure-monitor' TIMESERIES SINCE 1 hour ago
```

Custom metrics are not supported by the Azure Monitor integration at the moment.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="alerts"
    title="Alert conditions"
  >

You can create [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/) [alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) on metrics from the New Relic Azure Monitor integration. 

Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the Azure Monitor integration only. For example:

```
FROM Metric
SELECT max(`azure.storage.storageaccounts.SuccessServerLatency`)
WHERE collector.name = 'azure-monitor' 
FACET azure.region, azure.resourceId
```

Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because Azure Monitor receives metrics from services with a certain delay. 

To configure the signal settings, under **Condition Settings**, click on **Advanced Signal Settings** and enter the following values:

- **Aggregation window**: With a one minute aggregation window, we recommend setting an eight minute evalaution offset.

See documentation on [how to create NRQL alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/) for more details.

A partial list of entities are available as part of the Limited Preview. Customers can create custom dashboards and alerts on top of new metrics.

We expect to cover feature-parity and have all entities from the 30 Azure services we have today and will continue adding support for more services over the next few months.

List of services that create entities:

- Azure App Service Plans
- Azure Flexible DB for MySQL
- Azure Flexible DB for PostgreSQL
- Azure Functions Apps
- Azure Load Balancer
- Azure Redis Cache
- Azure Storage Accounts
- Azure SQL Databases
- Azure SQL Elastic Pools
- Azure Service Bus Namespaces
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Virtual Networks
- Azure Virtual Networks Network Interfaces
- Azure Virtual Networks Public IP Address

List of services from the simple definitions (synthesis rules):

- Azure API Management
- Azure App Gateways
- Azure Containers
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Express Routes
- Azure Firewalls
- Azure Frontdoors
- Azure Key Vaults
- Azure Logic Apps

## Migrate to the Azure Monitor integration

When migrating from individual Azure integration to the Azure Monitor integration, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- When you enable an Azure Monitor integration, new separate entities will be created for all of your resources. The entities created by the Azure Polling integration are staying as they are. This means you must update dashboards, alerts, and any other capability that refrences those entities.  
- Old entities are available for 24 hours
