Our [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) integrations allow you to monitor and report data about your Azure services to New Relic, providing a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place.

The Azure integrations are not the same as [APM's .NET support for Azure](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation).

## Requirements [#permissions]

Check the docs of our [Azure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list) for requirements for specific integrations.

New Relic cannot obtain monitoring data from resources that are located in Azure Government or that were created through the [classic deployment model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model).

## Features [#features]

After you [activate your Azure integration](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations), New Relic begins to query your Azure platform services according to a regular [polling interval](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations). You can use our integrations UI to:

* View performance data from [Integrations dashboards](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) that automatically scale as you make changes to your ecosystem.
* Manage [alert conditions](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration) with alerts.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

## Cost considerations [#cost-considerations]

When evaluating the cost of the Microsoft Azure integrations with New Relic, consider Azure's Monitor Pricing. Refer to the "Metric queries" cost item in the [Azure pricing documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/#pricing).

* Pricing is based on the number of API calls per month.
* An estimation of the API calls peformed by New Relic to the different Azure services can be seen in the UI, under **Infrastructure > Azure > Azure Status Dashboard**.
