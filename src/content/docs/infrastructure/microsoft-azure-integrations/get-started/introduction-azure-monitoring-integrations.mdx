We have several ways for you to monitor your [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) applications and services. Here's an overview of these offerings and why you'd use one versus the other.

* New Relic in Azure: With our [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native), you can deploy New Relic built on Azure, directly from the Azure portal. This option gives you the equivalent of both of the features below (and also Java app monitoring), and you can configure it directly from the Azure portal.
* Our Azure integrations: Our [Azure infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/activate-azure-integrations) support dozens of Azure services.
* .NET APM: You can install [our .NET APM agent](/install/dotnet) to monitor your Azure applications and receive detailed telemetry data.
