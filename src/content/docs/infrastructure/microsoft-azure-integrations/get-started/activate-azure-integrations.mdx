With our Azure infrastructure integrations, you can report data to New Relic from dozens of Azure platform services. For all our solutions for Azure monitoring, see [Introduction to Azure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations). 

## Features [#features]

To monitor your Azure services, we query them on a regular [polling interval](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations). With our Azure integrations, you can:

* View performance data from [dashboards](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data) that automatically scale as you make changes to your ecosystem.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration) to get notifications when things go wrong. 
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and create custom charts and dashboards to meet the specific observability challenges you have. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can use Terraform to automate the process of enabling cloud integrations: see the [Terraform docs site](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/cloud_integrations_guide).
</Callout>

## Requirements and limitations [#reqs]

Requirements include: 

* A New Relic account. Don't have one? [Sign up for free!](https://newrelic.com/signup) No credit card required.
* Specific [Azure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list) have their own requirements.

We cannot get data from Azure resources that: 

* Are located in Azure Government
* Were created through the [classic deployment model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model)

## Cost considerations [#cost-considerations]

When evaluating the cost of the Microsoft Azure integrations with New Relic, consider Azure's Monitor Pricing. Refer to the `Metric queries` cost item in the [Azure pricing documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/#pricing). Pricing details: 

* Pricing is based on the number of API calls per month.
* An estimate of the API calls we make to Azure services can be found on your [account status dashboard](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/cloud-integrations-account-status-dashboard).

## Overview of enabling Azure integrations [#overview]

We'll describe the process of activating our Azure integrations in more detail below, but here's an overview of that process: 

1. You'll create a New Relic application and key in Azure.
2. You'll grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor.
3. You'll place the required information in the <DoNotTranslate>**Integrations**</DoNotTranslate> UI.

To use these integration activation instructions directly from our infrastructure UI, go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs [#get-ids]

To get your Azure account's subscription `id` and `tenantId`, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use [Azure's Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell) terminal in the Azure portal.

1. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account.
2. Type the following:

   ```
   az account show
   ```
3. Copy and save the subscription `id` and `tenantID` from the output response for later use.

The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription `id` and `tenantID` are highlighted.

```js   lineHighlight=4,8
@Azure:~$ az account show
{
  "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
  "id": "9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21",
  "isDefault": true,
  "name": "Beyond Team Sandbox",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1",
  "user": {
    "name": "youremail@domain",
    "type": "user"
}
```

## Step 2: Register your app and get ID [#register-app]

You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its `Application ID`.

To register your app in Azure:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the <DoNotTranslate>**Azure Active Directory**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. From <DoNotTranslate>**Manage**</DoNotTranslate>, select <DoNotTranslate>**App registrations > New registration**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app `NewRelic-Integrations`.
4. In <DoNotTranslate>**Redirect URI**</DoNotTranslate> select `Web`and add `https://www.newrelic.com` as the sign-on URI.
5. Create the application by clicking <DoNotTranslate>**Register**</DoNotTranslate>.
6. From the <DoNotTranslate>**Overview**</DoNotTranslate> of your app, copy the <DoNotTranslate>**Application (client) ID**</DoNotTranslate>, and save it for later use.

## Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure [#create-client-secret]

To create a client secret associated with your application:

1. In Azure, under the application you've just created, select <DoNotTranslate>**Certificates & secrets**</DoNotTranslate>.
2. Under <DoNotTranslate>**Client secrets**</DoNotTranslate>, click on <DoNotTranslate>**New client secret**</DoNotTranslate> and then on <DoNotTranslate>**Add**</DoNotTranslate>. Choose the secret expiration date which can be up to 2 years. Once the secret expires, follow the steps to [update the application details](#update-app).
3. Copy the value of <DoNotTranslate>**Client Secret**</DoNotTranslate> and save it for later use.

## Step 4: Provide permissions to services [#read-permissions]

Your app must provide `Reader` permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor:

1. In the Azure <DoNotTranslate>**Subscriptions**</DoNotTranslate> section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor.
2. Select <DoNotTranslate>**Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment**</DoNotTranslate>.
3. From the <DoNotTranslate>**Role**</DoNotTranslate> dropdown, select <DoNotTranslate>**Reader**</DoNotTranslate>.
4. From the <DoNotTranslate>**Select**</DoNotTranslate> dropdown, select the app's name; for example, `NewRelic-Integrations`.
5. From <DoNotTranslate>**Selected members**</DoNotTranslate>, verify your app name appears, then select <DoNotTranslate>**Save**</DoNotTranslate>.

Some Azure services, including [Azure CosmosDB](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/azure-document-dbcosmos-db) and [Azure VMs](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/azure-vms-monitoring-integrations), require additional steps. See the [Azure integration documentation](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list) for the services you want to enable.

## Step 5: Add app to New Relic [#complete-integration]

Now you can activate the Azure integration from our infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including:

* Your Azure account's [subscription `id` and `tenantId`](#get-ids)
* The application's [application ID](#register-app)
* The application's [client secret](#create-client-secret)

To add your Azure app to New Relic:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure**</DoNotTranslate> and select the Azure Service you wish to add.
2. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic.
3. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For `Azure account name`, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your <DoNotTranslate>**Integrations**</DoNotTranslate> dashboard.)

After you activate an Azure integration, we'll start monitoring your Azure data at regular [polling intervals](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations). To [find and use your data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), use [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) or go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure**</DoNotTranslate>.

It may take few minutes until new resources are detected and synthesized as entities. See Cloud integrations [system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits) for more information.

## Update application details and rotate client secrets [#update-app]

It will be required to update the application's authentication credentials using the infrastructure UI or the [Cloud Integrations API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-cloud-integrations-api-tutorial/) once the client secret expires (maximum expiration date available in Azure is 2 years).

Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the infrastructure UI:

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Azure**</DoNotTranslate> and click on <DoNotTranslate>**Manage Services**</DoNotTranslate> on the Azure account you wish to edit.
2. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value.
3. Edit the <DoNotTranslate>**Client Secret**</DoNotTranslate> field with the new value and confirm with <DoNotTranslate>**Save Changes**</DoNotTranslate>.

## Uninstall Azure integrations [#uninstall]

To uninstall Azure integrations, follow these steps.
