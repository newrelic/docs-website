If your team deploys software and cloud services through Azure, our [Azure Native New Relic Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg) lets you manage the Azure-New Relic integration, and manage and install our infrastructure agent and our .NET and Java <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents, all directly from the Azure Portal.

The Azure Native New Relic Service lets you:

* Easily onboard and use New Relic as a natively integrated service built on Azure.
* Get a single bill for all the resources that you consume on Azure, including New Relic.
* Automatically monitor Azure subscription activity and resource logs for New Relic.
* Automatically monitor Azure metrics by using New Relic.
* Use a single experience to install and uninstall the New Relic agent on virtual machines and app services.

On top of that, you can then use New Relic for other non-Azure-related monitoring you might need, using any of [our 500+ integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

<Callout variant="important">
  * This service is only available for customers who opt to have Azure host their New Relic data. 
  * To avoid incurring additional charges ensure that the diagnostic settings on Azure resources are set accordingly or disable forwarding via Azure Native New Relic Service to avoid data being forwarded to New Relic platform.

## Integration details [#tech-details]

This service relies on [our Azure Monitor integration](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor).

## Note about data centers [#datacenters]

The Azure Native New Relic Service stores your data directly on Microsoft's Azure data centers. Currently the Azure Native service stores all data in Azure's US East region.

New Relic's log patterns service operates solely in Amazon Web Services. By using New Relic log patterns, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in Amazon Web Services. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's Azure data center or in our Amazon Web Services data center.
