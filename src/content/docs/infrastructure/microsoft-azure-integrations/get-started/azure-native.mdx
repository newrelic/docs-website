If your team deploys software and cloud services through Azure, our [Azure Native New Relic Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg) lets you deploy and manage New Relic directly through the Azure Marketplace. With it, you can: 

* Create a free New Relic account or purchase New Relic directly from your Azure Portal
* Manage billing directly through Azure Marketplace
* Deploy New Relic APM and infrastructure agents through an automated setup flow 
* Manage the metrics and logs for all your resources through an interactive dashboard

## Available features [#features]

You can deploy the following agents through the Azure Native New Relic Service:

* The .NET and Java APM agents
* The infrastructure agent, for Windows and Linux systems

Other agents and integrations are available. You can browse them from within New Relic or on our [Instant Observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

Our Standard and Pro [editions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) are available, but not yet Enterprise edition. 

This service comes with our [Data Plus option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus) but not all Data Plus features are available. For details, see the [Data Plus docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus).

## Get the Azure Native New Relic Service [#get-it]

For in-depth docs on how to set this up, see the [Microsoft Azure docs site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/new-relic/new-relic-create), but here's a short summary of setup instructions. 

First, you'll need to create a New Relic resource in the Azure Portal: 

1. In the Azure Marketplace, subscribe to the Azure Native New Relic Service.
2. In your Azure Portal, create a New Relic resource.
3. Select **Create a New Relic resource** to create a new New Relic account, or you can **Link an existing New Relic resource** to link to an existing account.
4. Complete the prompt that appears and select **Review + create**.
5. Configure how your service reports metrics and logs in the **Resource configuration** tab.
6. Verify that New Relic is receiving data in the **Monitored resources** tab of the Azure Portal. Resources with a green checkmark are sending data to New Relic.

## Log into New Relic [#login-newrelic]

Once you've created your New Relic resource and verified that Azure is sending data to it, you can go into New Relic. 

To log into New Relic: 

1. On the Azure **Overview** page for the new resource, click **Login to New Relic account**. 
2. You'll need to create a new password. To do this, click **Forgot your password**. 
3. Enter your email address. It must be the same one you use for your Azure account.

* [View your logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
* [Set up alerting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition)

## Pricing details [#pricing]

For pricing details and other feature explanations, see [the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg).

## Note about datacenters [#datacenters]

The Azure Native New Relic Service stores your data directly on Microsoft's Azure data centers. Currently the Azure Native service stores all data in Azure's US East region. 

New Relic's log patterns service operates solely in Amazon Web Services. By using New Relic log patterns, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in Amazon Web Services. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's Azure data center or in our Amazon Web Services data center.
