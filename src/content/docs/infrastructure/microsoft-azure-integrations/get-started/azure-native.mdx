If your team deploys software and cloud services through Azure, our [Azure Native New Relic Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg) lets you deploy and manage New Relic directly through the Azure Marketplace. With it, you: 

* Can create a free New Relic account or purchase New Relic directly from your Azure Portal
* Can manage billing directly through Azure Marketplace
* Get a single bill for the resources you consume on Azure, including New Relic
* Can manage the metrics and logs for all your Azure resources through an interactive dashboard

## Available features [#features]

Your Azure Native New Relic Service works almost exactly the same as a standard New Relic sign-up, with the exception of a few caveats mentioned here. Details on available features:

* From Azure, you can deploy our .NET and Java APM agents and our infrastructure agent for Linux and Windows systems. (Our other [New Relic integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability) can be added from New Relic.)
* Our Standard and Pro [editions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions) are available, but not yet Enterprise edition. 
* This services comes with our Data Plus option but not all Data Plus features are available. For details, see [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/#data-plus).

## Get the Azure Native New Relic Service [#get-it]

For in-depth docs on how to set this up, see the [Microsoft Azure docs site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/new-relic/new-relic-overview), but here's a short summary of setup instructions.

First, you'll need to create a New Relic resource in the Azure Portal: 

1. In the Azure Marketplace, subscribe to the Azure Native New Relic Service.
2. In your Azure Portal, create a New Relic resource.
3. Select **Create a New Relic resource** to create a new New Relic account, or you can **Link an existing New Relic resource** to link to an existing account.
4. Complete the prompt that appears and select **Review + create**.
5. Configure how your service reports metrics and logs in the **Resource configuration** tab. 
6. Verify that New Relic is receiving data in the **Monitored resources** tab of the Azure Portal. Resources with a green checkmark are sending data to New Relic.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure docs site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/new-relic/new-relic-overview)

## Log into New Relic [#login-newrelic]

Once you've created your New Relic resource and verified that Azure is sending data to it, you can go into New Relic. 

To log into New Relic: 

1. On the Azure **Overview** page for the new resource, click **Login to New Relic account**. 
2. You'll need to create a new password. To do this, click **Forgot your password**. 
3. Enter your email address. It must be the same one you use for your Azure account.

## Pricing details [#pricing]

For pricing details and other feature explanations, see [the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg).

## Note about datacenters [#datacenters]

The Azure Native New Relic Service stores your data directly on Microsoft's Azure data centers. Currently the Azure Native service stores all data in Azure's US East region. 

New Relic's log patterns service operates solely in Amazon Web Services. By using New Relic log patterns, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in Amazon Web Services. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's Azure data center or in our Amazon Web Services data center.
