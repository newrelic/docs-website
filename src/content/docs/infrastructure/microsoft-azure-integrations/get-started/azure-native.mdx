If your team deploys software and cloud services through Azure, our [Azure Native New Relic Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg) lets you manage the Azure-New Relic integration, and manage and install our infrastructure agent and our .NET and Java <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents, all directly from the Azure Portal.

The Azure Native New Relic Service lets you:

* Easily onboard and use New Relic as a natively integrated service built on Azure.
* Get a single bill for all the resources that you consume on Azure, including New Relic.
* Automatically monitor Azure subscription activity and resource logs for New Relic.
* Automatically monitor Azure metrics by using New Relic.
* Use a single experience to install and uninstall the New Relic agent on virtual machines and app services.

On top of that, you can then use New Relic for other non-Azure-related monitoring you might need, using any of [our 500+ integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

1. In the Azure Marketplace, subscribe to the Azure Native New Relic Service.
2. In your Azure Portal, create a New Relic resource.
3. Select <DNT>**Create a New Relic resource**</DNT> to create a new New Relic account, or you can <DNT>**Link an existing New Relic resource**</DNT> to link to an existing resource.
4. Complete the prompt that appears and select <DNT>**Review + create**</DNT>.
5. Configure how your service reports metrics and logs in the <DNT>**Resource configuration**</DNT> tab.
6. Go to <DNT>**App services**</DNT> to enable our <InlinePopover type="apm"/> agents. Go to <DNT>**Virtual machines**</DNT> to enable our infrastructure agent.
7. Verify that New Relic is receiving data in the <DNT>**Monitored resources**</DNT> tab of the Azure Portal. Resources with a green checkmark are sending data to New Relic.

For details on setup, see the [Microsoft Azure docs site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/new-relic/new-relic-overview)

## Integration details [#tech-details]

This service relies on [our Azure Monitor integration](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-monitor).

## Note about data centers [#datacenters]

The Azure Native New Relic Service stores your data directly on Microsoft's Azure data centers. Currently the Azure Native service stores all data in Azure's US East region.

New Relic's log patterns service operates solely in Amazon Web Services. By using New Relic log patterns, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in Amazon Web Services. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's Azure data center or in our Amazon Web Services data center.
