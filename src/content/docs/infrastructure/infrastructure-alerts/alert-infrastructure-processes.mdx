Use New Relic infrastructure's <DNT>**Process running**</DNT> [alert condition](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) to be notified when a set of processes on your [filtered hosts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/filter-group/filter-sets-organize-your-infrastructure-hosts) stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when:

* Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting
* A process is running too many instances on one host

This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation.

## Before you begin

<Callout variant="important">
**Required setup:** The infrastructure agent doesn't send process data by default. Before creating process alerts:

1. **Enable process metrics** in your infrastructure agent configuration:
   ```yaml
   enable_process_metrics: true
   ```

2. **Optional:** Fine-tune which processes to monitor:
   - Use [`include_matching_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#include-matching-metrics) to specify processes to include
   - Use [`exclude_matching_metrics`](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#exclude-matching-metrics) to specify processes to exclude

3. **Verify setup:** Check that process data appears in <DNT>**Infrastructure > Processes**</DNT> (wait 5-10 minutes after enabling)

For detailed configuration instructions, see [Infrastructure configuration settings](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#enable-process-metrics).
</Callout>

## How process alerts work

Process alerts monitor the **count of running processes** that match your criteria:
- **Hosts** → Which servers to monitor
- **Process filters** → Which processes on those servers
- **Threshold** → When to trigger an alert (too many, too few, or none)
- **Duration** → How long the condition must persist

## Common scenarios [#features]

By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define [alerting thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) to decide when incidents open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's [incident preferences](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).

**Most popular:** Monitor critical services that must always run → [Jump to setup](#create-condition)

**Also common:**
- Ensure load balancers have enough worker processes
- Detect runaway processes consuming resources
- Monitor containerized microservices

  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> Use the <DNT>**No processes are running**</DNT> (default) threshold.

    **Example configuration:**
    - **Process filter**: `processDisplayName = 'nginx'`
    - **Threshold**: "No processes are running" for 2 minutes
    - **Use case**: Web server monitoring
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="processes-load"
    title="Ensure enough worker processes for load balancing"
  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. You need to be alerted when there aren't enough processes to handle the load.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> Use the <DNT>**Fewer than**</DNT> threshold.

    **Example configuration:**
    - **Process filter**: `processDisplayName = 'gunicorn'`
    - **Threshold**: "Fewer than 8 processes running" for 5 minutes
    - **Use case**: Python web application scaling
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="microservices-example"
    title="Monitor containerized microservices"
  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> You have Docker containers running microservices, and you need to ensure each service maintains the expected number of replicas.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> Use container labels to filter and monitor specific services.

    **Example configuration:**
    - **Host filter**: `containerLabel.service = 'user-api'`
    - **Threshold**: "Fewer than 3 processes running" for 3 minutes
    - **Policy**: Create dedicated policy for microservices with Slack notifications
    - **Use case**: Kubernetes/Docker service monitoring

## Create an infrastructure process running condition [#create-condition]

To define the <DNT>**Process running**</DNT> alert criteria:

1. **Start creating your alert condition** using one of these methods:

   **Method A: From Alerts & AI (Recommended)**
   - Navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI > Alert conditions**</DNT>
   - Click <DNT>**New alert condition**</DNT>
   - Select <DNT>**Infrastructure**</DNT> as the data source

   **Method B: From Infrastructure monitoring**
   - Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure > Settings > Alert conditions**</DNT>
   - Click <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>

   **Method C: From a chart (Quick method)**
   - Navigate to <DNT>**Infrastructure**</DNT> and find a relevant chart
   - Hover over the chart and select the ellipses (three dots) icon
   - Select <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>

2. **Name your condition:** Type a meaningful condition name (e.g., "Critical Web Server Process Down").

3. **Select alert type:** Choose <DNT>**Process running**</DNT> as the <DNT>**Alert type**</DNT>.

4. **Configure host and process filters:**

   **Host filtering:**
   - **All hosts**: Leave filters blank to monitor all hosts
   - **Specific hosts**: Use attributes like `hostname`, `os`, or custom tags
   - **Host groups**: Select existing filter sets or create new ones

   **Process filtering examples:**
   - **Process name**: `processDisplayName = 'nginx'`
   - **Command line**: `commandLine LIKE '%java%'`
   - **User**: `userName = 'root'`
   - **Multiple processes**: `processDisplayName IN ('nginx', 'apache', 'httpd')`

   💡 **Pro tip:** Click <DNT>**Preview results**</DNT> to verify your filters match the expected hosts and processes before proceeding.

5. **Configure alert thresholds:**

   **Choose threshold type:**
   - **No processes are running** (default): Alert when process count = 0
   - **At least one process is running**: Alert when process count ≥ 1
   - **Fewer than**: Alert when process count &lt; specified number
   - **More than**: Alert when process count &gt; specified number
   - **Exactly**: Alert when process count = specified number

   **Set time duration:**
   - **Critical threshold**: How long the condition must persist (1-60 minutes)
   - **Default**: 5 minutes (recommended for most use cases)
   - **Shorter duration**: More sensitive, may create noise
   - **Longer duration**: Less sensitive, may miss brief outages

6. **Optional:** To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the [<DNT>**Enabled**</DNT> checkbox option](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#enabled).

7. **Configure alert policy and notifications:**

   **Option A: Use existing policy**
   - Select a policy from the dropdown
   - Review the policy's notification channels and incident preferences

   **Option B: Create new policy**
   - Enter a descriptive policy name (e.g., "Critical Infrastructure Processes")
   - **Add notification channels:**
     - **Email**: Enter email addresses for alerts
     - **Slack**: Connect Slack channels for team notifications
     - **PagerDuty**: Set up for on-call escalation
     - **Webhook**: Configure custom integrations

8. **Optional configuration:**

   **Runbook URL:** Add a link to your troubleshooting procedures
   - Example: `https://company.wiki/process-alerts-runbook`
   - Appears in alert notifications to help responders

   **Custom violation description:** Add context for alert recipients
   - Example: "Critical service \{\{conditionName\}\} stopped on \{\{tags.hostname\}\}"

9. **Optional:** Set the [<DNT>**Close open incidents after**</DNT>](#incident-time-limit) time limit to automatically close open incidents after a certain amount of time (this defaults to 24 hours for infrastructure conditions).

10. **Create the condition:** Select <DNT>**Create**</DNT> to save your configuration.

If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's [incident preferences](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents). Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.

## Verify your alert works [#verify-alert]

After creating your condition:

1. **Check the condition status:** Look for a green status indicator next to your condition name. Green means it's receiving data; red indicates a configuration issue.

2. **Test notification channels:** Use the <DNT>**Send test notification**</DNT> option in your alert policy to verify your notification channels work correctly.

3. **Monitor the first 24 hours:** New conditions may need threshold adjustments based on your actual process behavior patterns.

4. **Validate with a controlled test:** If possible, temporarily stop a monitored process to confirm the alert triggers as expected.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

### Common issues

**No alerts triggering despite stopped processes:**
- Verify `enable_process_metrics: true` in infrastructure agent configuration
- Check that the infrastructure agent is running and reporting data
- Confirm your process filters match actual process names (case-sensitive)
- Wait 5-10 minutes after configuration changes for data to appear

**Too many false positives:**
- Increase the threshold duration (e.g., 5 minutes → 10 minutes)
- Refine your process filters to be more specific
- Consider using "By condition and signal" incident preference to reduce noise
- Review your process patterns during expected restart periods

**Process names not appearing in filters:**
- Check the <DNT>**Infrastructure > Processes**</DNT> page to see available process data
- Verify processes are actually running on monitored hosts
- Ensure your host filters aren't excluding the hosts where processes run
- **Common filter mistakes:**
  -  `processName = nginx` (missing quotes)
  -  `processDisplayName = 'nginx'`
  -  `hostname contains web` (wrong operator)
  -  `hostname LIKE '%web%'`

**Need to monitor processes across multiple environments:**
- Use host tags to differentiate environments (e.g., `environment:production`)
- Create separate conditions for each environment with appropriate filters
- Use filter sets to group hosts by environment or function
