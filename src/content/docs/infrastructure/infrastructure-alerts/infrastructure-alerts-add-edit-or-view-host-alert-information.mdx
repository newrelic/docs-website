With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create [alert conditions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-condition) directly within the context of what you're currently monitoring with New Relic.

For example, if you've used the [filter bar](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities) to filter to a specific set of hosts, and you notice a problem, you can create an alert from the infrastructure UI. To create the alert, select a saved filter view, and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you're viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment.

Alert conditions apply to alert [policies](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-policy). You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from our infrastructure UI. If you want to use other types of [notification channels](/docs/alerts/get-notified/intro-notifications/#channels), create a [new policy](/docs/alerts/organize-alerts/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) from within the <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> UI.

<Callout
  id="rest-api-alert-limit"
  variant="important"
>
  The infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit.

## Create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart [#create-condition-chart]

To create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT> and mouse over a chart you want to alert on.

2. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select <DNT>**Create alert condition**</DNT>.

    alt="Create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-infra-chart.webp"
    />

3. A new window opens with your pre-populated query. Click <DNT>**Run**</DNT> to check if the query shows what you need.

    alt="Create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-infra-chart-query.webp"
    />

4. Click <DNT>**Next**</DNT>.

5. Set some thresholds to create the alert condition. See the [Create alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions) document to know more about these settings.

<Callout variant="important">
  If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a "silent attribute", and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the [API](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts/) to create alert conditions for silent attributes.
</Callout>

## Create an alert condition from the infrastructure settings [#create-condition-infra-settings]

To create an alert condition from the infrastructure settings, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT>.

2. Under the <DNT>**Settings**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Alerts**</DNT>.

3. Click <DNT>**+ New alert condition**</DNT>.

    <img
    title="Create an alert condition from the infrastructure settings"
    alt="Create an alert condition from the infrastructure settings"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-infra-settings.webp"
    />

3. A new window opens to set your alert condition.

    <img
    title="Create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart"
    alt="Create an alert condition from an infrastructure chart"
    src="/images/alerts_screenshot-crop_conditions-create-infra-settings-fields.webp"
    />

    Fill in the fields to configure your alert condition:

    * <DNT>**Name this alert condition**</DNT>: We recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your condition easily.

    * <DNT>**Describe this condition**</DNT>: This is an optional field. You can use this field to add context to your alert. For example, describe the problem you're trying to detect or the goal of the alerts.

    * <DNT>**Choose an alert type**</DNT>: Choose your alert type between the options you've.

    * <DNT>**Narrow down your alert type**</DNT>: You can add filters to narrow your type of alert by setting a specific attribute, operator, and values.

    * <DNT>**Define thresholds**</DNT>: Set warning and critical [thresholds](/docs/alerts/alert-conditions/set-thresholds/) that if exceeded mean an issue and will open an [incident](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident).

    * <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT>: Select an existing policy or [create a new one](/docs/alerts/organize-alerts/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) to add your alert condition to the policy. Decide if you want to enable your alert condition now or not by turning on or off the <DNT>**Enabled**</DNT> toggle. Finally, if you'd like to link to a [runbook](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-runbook) for the condition that triggered the incident, you can add the URL in the runbook URL field.  

4. Click <DNT>**Create**</DNT>.

## View infrastructure alert events [#view-alerts]

Anyone included in the policy's [notification channels](/docs/alerts/get-notified/intro-notifications/#channels) receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view infrastructure alert incidents and individual incidents through the user interface.

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure**</DNT>.

2. Under the <DNT>**Overview**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Events**</DNT>.

3. Select <DNT>**alerts**</DNT> category.

4. Use the search field, the entity filter bar or time functions to personalize your search.

5. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on a specific row to view the [detailed information about that alert](/docs/alerts/incident-management/view-event-details-incidents).

## Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries [#alert-nrql-error]

Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed.

To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Problem
      </th>

      <th>
        Solution
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hosts
      </td>

      <td>
        * If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts.
        * Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting `prod-host-01`, `prod-host-02`, and `prod-host-03`, just target all hosts with `prod-host-0` in the name.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Entities
      </td>

      <td>
        * Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target.
        * Create [custom attributes](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/collect-custom-attributes/) for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
