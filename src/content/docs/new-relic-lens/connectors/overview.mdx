<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Before querying data with [New Relic Lens](/docs/new-relic-lens/overview), you need to set up connections to your data sources. Lens provides both system connectors for accessing NRDB data and data connectors for connecting to external databases and other data sources.

## System connectors [#system-connectors]

By default, Lens provides three system connectors for accessing NRDB data. These connectors are available automatically and don't require any setup.

      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Connector</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Telemetry**</td>
      <td>Access telemetry data from NRDB, such as transactions, logs, and metrics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Entity**</td>
      <td>Access entity data from NRDB, including services, hosts, and applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Materialized views**</td>
      <td>Access materialized view data stored in NRDB (results from queries joining multiple databases).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### System connector access [#system-connector-access]

* **Telemetry and Entity connectors**: Work at the account level and are available to users with appropriate permissions. When querying NRDB data, you must specify the account ID from which you want to pull data. You can only access data from accounts for which you have permissions.

* **Materialized views connector**: Works at the organization level. All users with Lens access can query materialized views created within their organization.

## Data connectors [#data-connectors]

Data connectors allow you to connect Lens to external data sources such as databases, data warehouses, and spreadsheets. Once configured, data connectors are available at the organization level for users with appropriate permissions to query.

<Callout variant="important">
Only Org managers or users with custom roles containing connector creation capabilities can set up data connectors.
</Callout>

### Supported data sources [#supported-sources]

Lens supports connecting to the following external data sources:

* **Cloud data warehouses**: Snowflake
* **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, OpenSearch, and Redshift
* **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets
* **Data lakes**: Iceberg
* **Metrics**: Prometheus

For detailed configuration information for each connector type, see [Supported connectors](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/supported-connectors).

### Connector scope [#connector-scope]

All data connectors are org-scoped:

* All users within the organization can see connectors listed on the Connectors page
* Users can view connector details, but credentials remain hidden
* Users can only query connectors they have been granted access to
* Admins can grant access to specific users or user groups for each connector

For details on managing who can access each connector, see [Manage connector access](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/manage-access).
