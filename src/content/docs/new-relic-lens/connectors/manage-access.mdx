<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Org managers can control who has access to query each connector in Lens. This page explains how to grant and remove access to connectors, and describes the access behavior for different user roles.

## Default access [#default-access]

When you create a new connector, by default only the following users have access:

* The user who created the connector
* Org managers

All other users must be explicitly granted access before they can query the connector.

## Grant access to a connector [#grant-access]

To grant users or user groups access to a connector:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Administration > Connectors**.
2. Find the connector you want to manage and click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu.
3. Select **Edit**.
4. In the access control section, configure the following:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Auth domain** | Select the authentication domain containing the users or groups you want to grant access to. Authentication domains are organization-specific and contain your user directory. |
   | **User or group** | Search and select the specific users or user groups to grant access. You can select multiple users and groups. |
   | **Role** | Select the Lens role to assign. Currently, only the **Viewer** role is available, which allows users to query the connector. |

5. Click **Add** to add the selected users or groups.
6. Click **Save changes**.

<Callout variant="tip">
You can also configure access control when creating a new connector. The access control fields are available in the connector creation form.

## Remove access from a connector [#remove-access]

To remove a user or group's access to a connector:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Administration > Connectors**.
2. Find the connector and click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, then select **Edit**.
3. In the access control section, find the user or group you want to remove.
4. Click the delete icon next to their entry.
5. Click **Save changes**.

## Access behavior [#access-behavior]

When working with connector access:

* **Visibility**: All users can view all connectors listed on the Connectors page, regardless of their access level. This allows users to see what data sources are available in the organization.
* **Connector details**: Users can view connector details such as connector type and connection URLs, but passwords and credentials remain hidden.
* **Query restrictions**: If a user without access tries to query a connector, the query fails with an error message indicating they don't have permission.
* **Edit restrictions**: Users without edit permissions cannot modify connector settings or manage access for others. Only Org managers and users with appropriate custom roles can edit connectors.

## Who can manage access [#who-can-manage]

The following users can grant or remove access to connectors:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Role</th>
      <th>Access management capabilities</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Org manager**</td>
      <td>Can create, edit, and delete any connector. Can grant or remove access for any user or group.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Custom role with Lens permissions**</td>
      <td>Users with custom roles containing the appropriate Lens IAM capabilities can manage connectors and access. Authentication domain managers can create these custom roles.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For details on the required IAM capabilities, see [IAM capabilities](/docs/new-relic-lens/overview#iam-capabilities).
