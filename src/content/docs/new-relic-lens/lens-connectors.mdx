<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Before querying data with [New Relic Lens](/docs/new-relic-lens/introduction), you need to set up connections to your data sources. Lens provides both system connectors for accessing NRDB data and data connectors for connecting to external databases and other data sources.

## System connectors [#system-connectors]

By default, Lens provides three system connectors for accessing NRDB data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Connector</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Telemetry**</td>
      <td>Access telemetry data from NRDB, such as transactions, logs, and metrics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Entity**</td>
      <td>Access entity data from NRDB, including services, hosts, and applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Materialized views**</td>
      <td>Access materialized view data stored in NRDB (results from queries joining multiple databases).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The Telemetry and Entity connectors work at the account level and are available to users with appropriate permissions. Materialized views work at the organization level. When querying NRDB data, you must specify the account ID from which you want to pull data. You can only access data from accounts for which you have permissions.

## Data connectors [#data-connectors]

<Callout variant="important">
Only users with Admin permissions or users with custom roles containing connector creation capabilities can set up data connectors. Once configured, data connectors are available at the organization level for users with appropriate permissions to query.
</Callout>

### Supported connector types [#supported-connectors]

Lens supports the following data connector types:

<CollapserGroup>

### Create a connector [#create-connector]

To set up a data connector:

1. From the New Relic platform, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Administration > Connectors**.
2. Click **Create a connector**.
3. Select your connector type from the dropdown menu.
4. Enter the required connection information for your selected connector type.
5. Click **Create**.

After creating a connector, you can view its schema or delete it from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu.

## Manage connector access [#manage-access]

Admins can control who has access to query each connector. By default, only the connector creator and account admins have access to a newly created connector.

### Grant access to a connector [#grant-access]

To grant users or user groups access to a connector:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open connector settings

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Administration > Connectors**.
    2. Find the connector you want to manage and click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu.
    3. Select **Edit**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Navigate to access control

    In the Edit connector modal, click the **Access control** tab.

      title="Lens connector access control"
      alt="Screenshot showing the Access control tab in the Edit connector modal"
      src={lensAccessControl}
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add users or groups

    1. Select an **Auth domain** from the dropdown.
    2. Select a **User or group** to grant access to.
    3. Select a **Role**. Currently, only the **Viewer** role is available, which allows users to query the connector.
    4. Click **Add**.

    <img
      title="Lens connector access granted"
      alt="Screenshot showing users with access to a connector"
      src={lensAccessGranted}
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Save changes

4. In the **Who has access** section, find the user or group you want to remove.
5. Click the delete icon next to their entry.
6. Click **Save changes**.

### Access behavior [#access-behavior]

When working with connector access:

* All users can view all connectors listed on the Connectors page, regardless of their access level.
* Users can view connector details such as connector type and connection URLs, but passwords and credentials remain hidden.
* If a user without access tries to query a connector, the query fails with an error message indicating they don't have permission.
* Users without edit permissions cannot modify connector settings or manage access for others.
