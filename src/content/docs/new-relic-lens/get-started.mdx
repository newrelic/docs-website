<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Lens operates exclusively within New Relic [Notebooks](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/notebooks/introduction-notebooks/). Notebooks are structured, shareable documents that combine queries, visualizations, and descriptive markdown blocks to capture analytical workflows. To use Lens, you create SQL blocks in a notebook to query your data sources.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you start:

* Ensure you have access to a New Relic account with Lens enabled
* Verify you have the necessary [permissions](/docs/new-relic-lens/overview#permissions) to query data sources
* If you need to query external data sources, ensure the [connectors](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/overview) are set up

## Access Lens [#access-lens]

To access Lens and start querying:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Query your data**.
2. Enable the toggle beside **Notebooks**. The **+ SQL** button appears.
3. Click **+ SQL** to add a SQL block where you can write your queries.

## Write your first query [#first-query]

Once you have a SQL block open:

1. From the account dropdown, select the account from which you want to query NRDB data.

   <Callout variant="tip">
   The account selector is only relevant when querying NRDB system connectors. Data connectors are available at the organization level and don't require account selection.
   </Callout>

2. Write your SQL query using the format: `connection_name.schema.table`

   For example, to query the count of Transactions per appName in NRDB:
   ```sql
   SELECT appName, count(*)
   FROM telemetry.Transaction
   GROUP BY appName
   ```

3. Click **Run** to execute your query and view the results.

## Example queries [#example-queries]

Here are some common query patterns to get you started:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser id="nrdb-query" title="Query NRDB telemetry data">
    Query transaction data from NRDB:
    ```sql
    SELECT appName, count(*), average(duration)
    FROM telemetry.Transaction
    GROUP BY appName
    ORDER BY count(*) DESC
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="external-connector" title="Query an external data source">
    Query data from a Google Sheets connector:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM gsheets.default.employees
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="cross-db-join" title="Cross-database join">
    Join data from multiple sources:
    ```sql
    WITH employees AS (
      SELECT * FROM gsheets.default.employees
    ),
    logins AS (
      SELECT * FROM telemetry.user_logins
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM logins
    JOIN employees ON logins.user_id = employees.employee_id
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Next steps [#next-steps]

Now that you've written your first query, explore more Lens capabilities:

* [Set up connectors](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/supported-connectors) to connect to external data sources
* [Create materialized views](/docs/new-relic-lens/materialized-views) for complex, frequently-run queries
* [Learn more SQL patterns](/docs/new-relic-lens/query-data) for cross-database joins and advanced queries
