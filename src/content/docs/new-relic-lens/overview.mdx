<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

As a New Relic user, you may need to analyze your telemetry data alongside data stored across multiple databases, data warehouses, and spreadsheets. Manually exporting data from each source and combining it with your observability data offline takes time and reduces productivity. Additionally, you often can't consolidate all data into a single database due to compliance, security, or operational requirements.

New Relic Lens addresses these challenges. Lens is a unified query platform within New Relic that lets you connect and query multiple data sources directly from New Relic. Write a query in Lens using ANSI SQL and perform cross-database joins to analyze and correlate data from various sources.

## What you can do [#features]

Whether you have business data in Snowflake, customer data in PostgreSQL, metrics in Prometheus, or spreadsheet data in Google Sheets, you can query all of this data using Lens. You can use Lens to:

<CollapserGroup>

  <Collapser id="connect-sources" title="Connect to multiple data sources">
    You can connect to various data sources including:
    * **NRDB**: New Relic's telemetry database and entities
    * **Cloud data warehouses**: Snowflake
    * **Relational databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redshift
    * **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets
    * **Data lakes**: Iceberg
    * **Metrics stores**: Prometheus

    For details on connecting data sources, refer to [Lens connectors](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/overview). If you want to connect to additional databases, contact your account team to confirm compatibility with Lens.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="query-sql" title="Query data using ANSI SQL">
    Lens uses ANSI SQL to query its data sources, so you don't need to learn database-specific query languages. Lens translates your ANSI SQL queries to work with each data source.

    <Callout variant="tip">
    When querying data sources, Lens doesn't restrict the number of rows you can retrieve. However, queries to NRDB through Lens maintain the same 5,000 row limit as NRQL.
    </Callout>

    For more information on querying data with Lens, refer to [Query data with Lens](/docs/new-relic-lens/query-data).
  </Collapser>


  <Collapser id="cross-db-joins" title="Perform cross-database joins">
    You can run queries that join data from different data sources within a single SQL query. For example, you can join employee data from Google Sheets with user login data from NRDB to analyze access patterns.

      <Callout variant="tip">
      Lens pushes all computational work to the data source. The data source processes the query and returns only the results. Lens then combines results from multiple data sources to display the final output. Lens does not ingest raw data. It only combines the processed results.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="materialized-views" title="Create and manage materialized views">
    For larger, computationally expensive queries, you can store the results as materialized views. Query the materialized view instead of running the complex query each time. You can refresh the view to get the latest data. This approach avoids repeatedly fetching the same data from data sources in short intervals, reducing query costs and improving performance.

    For details on creating and managing materialized views, refer to [Materialized views](/docs/new-relic-lens/materialized-views).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser id="manage-access" title="Manage connector access">
    Admins can control who has access to query each connector. You can grant access to specific users or user groups for each connector, ensuring that only authorized users can query sensitive data sources.

    For details on managing connector access, refer to [Manage connector access](/docs/new-relic-lens/connectors/manage-access).
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

## Use cases [#use-cases]

Lens enables various data analysis scenarios:

* **Budget analysis**: Compare New Relic utilization data from NRDB with budget data stored in Snowflake to track spending against allocated budgets.
* **Workflow optimization**: Replace multiple manual export/import steps (from one database to another) with a single SQL query that joins all necessary data, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
* **Aggregate data across regions**: Track user traffic across various geographical regions by unioning data from different data sources.
* **Performance optimization with materialized views**: An executive dashboard combines data from 5+ databases and refreshes weekly. By storing the results from the multi-database `JOIN` query in a materialized view, you avoid running the computationally expensive query each time someone loads the dashboard. This reduces query costs and significantly improves page load speed.

## User roles and permissions [#permissions]

Access to Lens features depends on your user role. The following sections describe the permissions for different Lens operations.

### Connector permissions [#connector-permissions]

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>Role</th>
      <th>Permissions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Org manager**</td>
      <td>
        * Create, edit, and delete connectors
        * Add or remove users and user groups to any role for a connector
        * Query all connectors
        * Refresh connector connections
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Custom role with Lens permissions**</td>
      <td>
        * Same permissions as Org manager when assigned the appropriate Lens capabilities
        * Created by Authentication domain manager
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Viewer**</td>
      <td>
        * Query connectors they have been granted access to
        * View connector details (credentials remain hidden)
        * Refresh connector connections
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### IAM capabilities [#iam-capabilities]

Org managers or users with [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) containing specific IAM capabilities can perform the following operations:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>Operations</th>
      <th>Required capabilities</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Connectors: Full access**</td>
      <td>
        * `nr_lens.read.catalogs`
        * `nr_lens.create.catalogs`
        * `nr_lens.update.catalogs`
        * `nr_lens.delete.catalogs`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Connectors: Read only**</td>
      <td>`nr_lens.read.catalogs`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Query data sources**</td>
      <td>`nr_lens.query.connector`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Materialized views: Full access**</td>
      <td>
        * `nr_lens.read.materialized_views`
        * `nr_lens.create.materialized_views`
        * `nr_lens.update.materialized_views`
        * `nr_lens.refresh.materialized_views`
        * `nr_lens.delete.materialized_views`
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Materialized views: Read only**</td>
      <td>`nr_lens.read.materialized_views`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Materialized views: Refresh only**</td>
      <td>`nr_lens.refresh.materialized_views`</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Data access control [#data-access-control]

Access to data in Lens depends on the data source type:

* **Data connectors**: Available at the organization level for users with appropriate permissions. Connectors are org-scoped, meaning all users within the organization can see connectors listed, but can only query those they have been granted access to. Admins can grant access to specific users or user groups for each connector.
* **NRDB data**: Restricted to account-specific access based on your existing New Relic permissions. For example, if you only have access to Account A in New Relic, you can query NRDB data specific to Account A only.
