New Relic defines a [web or non-web transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) as one logical unit of work in a software application. Once you [instrument a transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent), you can also instrument errors in the transaction so you can monitor them in the New Relic UI. In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the New Relic function `newrelic_notice_error()` to it.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's `-rdynamic` linker flag to [link your apps when compiling](/docs/install-c-agent-compile-link-your-code#compile). The `-rdynamic` linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces.

For an index of documentation available during the private Beta, see the [C SDK table of contents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/c-agent-table-contents).

## Instrument errors in transactions [#errors]

To instrument errors in transactions:

1. [Start a transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent#start-transaction).
2. Record an error with [`newrelic_notice_error()`](https://source.datanerd.us/c-agent/c-agent/blob/master/examples/ex_notice_error.c), supplying the required parameters.
3. [End the transaction](/docs/instrument-transactions-c-agent#end-transaction).

## View errors

Transaction errors and [error traces](#error-trace-examples) appear on the [**Error analytics** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-manage-error-traces) in the New Relic UI. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute on the **Error analytics** page.

You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors in New Relic Insights as `TransactionError` events.
