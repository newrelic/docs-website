Effective April 30, 2025, our Data Exploration products will no longer be accessible via **Query Your Data** capability. Instead, you can access the query builder and data explorer by expanding the query console at the bottom of the platform UI.

## Background [#bg]

We are implementing updates to streamline access to our data exploration tools across the platform, including providing additional querying and data exploration features. 

## What's happening [#whats-happening]

* The **Query Your Data** capability will be removed from the menu. The legacy **Query Builder** and **Data Explorer** that are part of the **Query Your Data** capability will no longer be accessible. 
* **Query Builder** and **Data Explorer** will now be accessible through the console located at the bottom of the platform.
* PromQL query support will be integrated into the query console, allowing you to explore multiple PromQL queries simultaneously using multiple query tabs.

## What do you need to do [#what-to-do]

* For accessing **Query Builder** and **Data Explorer**: No action required from your side. You can access these tools through the console at the bottom of the platform UI.
* For querying with PromQL: Use the PromQL to NRQL translator found in the three-dot menu (kebab menu) within the new query console. Remember, the old **Query Builder** will not be available after April 30, 2025.
