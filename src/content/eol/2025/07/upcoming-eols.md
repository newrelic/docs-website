We are committed to continually improving your experience with our platform, and as part of this effort, we will be retiring or modifying certain features over the coming weeks. These changes are designed to streamline your interactions and enhance the overall functionality of our services.

## End-of-Life Updates [#updates]

### Invite a Teammate Feature [#invite]

* **What’s Changing:** The ability for all users to invite teammates will be modified on Tuesday, October 28, 2025 to only allow [Authentication Domain Managers](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) to invite and add users.

* **Why:** This will reduce unnecessary notifications and help to strengthen customer security practices around access controls when adding users to an existing organization.

* **Impact:** Users will need to contact Authentication Domain Managers for user invitations. No additional action is required from customers.



We encourage customers to [regularly update to the most current versions of New Relic agents](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/#update-your-agents-regularly) to avoid potential issues and maintain optimal functionality and security.

We understand that changes can sometimes be challenging, but these updates are necessary to help ensure an efficient and secure platform. Our Support team is here to assist you during this transition. If you have any questions about these changes, please [contact support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-get-support/).

Thank you for your understanding and support as we work to improve your experience.
