We are committed to continually improving your experience with our platform, and as part of this effort, we will be retiring or modifying certain features over the coming weeks. These changes are designed to streamline your interactions and enhance the overall functionality of our services.

## End-of-Life Updates [#updates]

### Invite a Teammate Feature [#invite]

* **What’s Changing:** The ability for all users to invite teammates will be modified on Tuesday, October 28, 2025 to only allow [Authentication Domain Managers](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings) to invite and add users.

* **Why:** This will reduce unnecessary notifications and help to strengthen customer security practices around access controls when adding users to an existing organization.

* **Impact:** Users will need to contact Authentication Domain Managers for user invitations. No additional action is required from customers.


### 32-bit Windows Binaries for Infrastructure Agent and NR Native On-Host Integrations [#32-bit]

* **What’s Changing:** Creation of 32-bit Windows binaries will be discontinued on Tuesday, October 14, 2025. Future releases will only support the creation of x64 Windows binaries.

* **Why:** This aligns with [Microsoft’s EOL date of Windows 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro), which was the last supported OS that had earlier been available in a 32-bit x86 version. Our focus will remain on supporting modern and secure operating systems.

* **Impact:** Customers using Windows 10 (32-bit) will no longer be able to upgrade the infrastructure agent. However, existing installations will continue to function. Customers on actively supported Windows versions, including all modern Windows Server OS editions are already on 64-bit versions. Customers on any OS that is beyond its vendor’s EOL date are expected to upgrade to an OS version that is actively supported. The old 32-bit binaries that were created before October 2025 will no longer be covered by New Relic’s Support team assistance but will be available for downloading if needed.

* **Documentation and Resources:** [Infrastructure Agent - OS compatibility](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-agent/requirements-infrastructure-agent/#os)

We encourage customers to [regularly update to the most current versions of New Relic agents](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/#update-your-agents-regularly) to avoid potential issues and maintain optimal functionality and security.

We understand that changes can sometimes be challenging, but these updates are necessary to help ensure an efficient and secure platform. Our Support team is here to assist you during this transition. If you have any questions about these changes, please [contact support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-get-support/).

Thank you for your understanding and support as we work to improve your experience.
