Effective June 16th, 2025, New Relic will deprecate the following data exploration user interfaces:

* The Metrics and Events capability
* Metrics Explorer and Events Explorer within entity views

Instead, users can access the query builder and data explorer by expanding the query console at the bottom of the platform UI.


## Background [#bg]

We are committed to enhancing your data querying experiences by streamlining our data exploration tools across the platform. This initiative is aimed at consolidating query building and data exploration into a unified, convenient location, thereby allowing us to innovate and enrich these functionalities further.

## What's happening [#whats-happening]
### Deprecation details

* **Metrics and Events** Capability: This will be removed from the left menu.
* **Metrics Explorer** and **Events Explorer**: These will no longer be accessible from the menus on specific entities.

### New access points
The features previously found in the deprecated tools will be available through the **Query Console** located at the bottom of the platform UI. Our new data explorer includes an intuitive, resizable point-and-click interface to seamlessly understand metrics, timeslices, events, and logs. You will be able to modify queries directly with the shared console between the Query Builder and the Data Explorer.

## What do you need to do [#what-to-do]

* No action is required from your side. You can now access the **query builder** and **data explorer** through the query console at the bottom of the platform UI.
