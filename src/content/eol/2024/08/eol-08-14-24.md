Beginning September 25, 2024, we're removing the ability to copy API keys from [the UI](https://get.newrelic.com/MzQxLVhLUC0zMTAAAAGUiZ8sq6uwzvQMEjtdfLs43rOhHFRYwkHxXjt8wYs2qCJP2IkoVpEZiGhCVneo-hfy1Ucijgo=). We're removing the **Copy key** option in the UI drop-down. This applies to user and license keys, both new and existing. If you have an automation that's dependent on scraping keys from the UI, please integrate using the NerdGraph API.

You're still able to retrieve your new and existing API keys through our [NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/use-nerdgraph-manage-license-keys-user-keys/#query-keys).

## What you need to do

Before **September 25, 2024**: You need to store your existing API keys (both user and license keys) in a secure location outside New Relic, if you haven't done that. **If you do not take this step, you will lose access to existing API keys in our UI.**

After September 25, 2024: when generating new API keys (both user and license keys), you need to copy the key to a secure location outside New Relic before leaving the page.

For more information, [see our docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#copy-keys).
