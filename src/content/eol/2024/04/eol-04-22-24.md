On October 22, 2024, New Relic will end of life (EOL):

* The Containerized Private Minion (CPM) capability
* Legacy synthetic monitoring runtimes, including our legacy Chrome 72 (or older) and Node version 10 (or older) runtimes 

## What you need to do

Update to the latest runtimes by [following procedures in our transition guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/), or by contacting support.

The new runtimes improve on our legacy runtime environment, including but not limited to these changes:  

* Updating to the new runtime will remove certain CVE findings that cannot be resolved due to the legacy runtime design and backward compatibility requirements of the Containerized Private Minion (CPM)
* Support for newer Chrome and Node.js versions, including easier upgrade paths
* More frequent browser version updates
* Access device emulation and other new capabilities 

**All customers must be on the new runtime by October 22, 2024 in order to prevent degradation.**

Read on to learn more about how the update affects your public or private locations.

### For public locations

* New Relic will update all broken link and certificate check monitors to the new runtime.
* Customers should update their scripted API, scripted browser, and step monitors to the new runtime [using the runtime upgrade UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/runtime-upgrade-ui) before October 22, 2024. 
   * If you do not update, weâ€™ll force update your monitors to the new runtime on the end-of-life date. **This may result in check failures and triggered alerts.**
   * Before updating to the new runtime, use the test results from the runtime upgrade UI to determine which monitors need to be modified.
* As of **August 26, 2024**, customers will be unable to create new monitors using legacy runtimes on public locations.

### For private locations

* You should [update to our new job manager](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/), which provides support for our new runtime on private locations. **If you don't, your monitors will stop running at the end-of-life date.**
* Once you're using the new job manager, update your monitors to the new runtime using the runtime upgrade UI. This includes all non-ping monitor types. 
   * If you do not update, we'll force update your monitors to the new runtime. **This may result in check failures and triggered alerts.**
   * Remember to use the test results from the runtime upgrade UI to determine the monitors that may require modifications before updating to the new runtime.
* On April 5, 2024, we added support for advanced features of the Containerized Private Minion (CPM) to the Synthetics Job Manager:
   * Verified script execution (VSE)
   * Custom environment variables
   * Custom node modules
* Customers will be unable to create new monitors using legacy runtimes on private locations as of **August 26, 2024**.
