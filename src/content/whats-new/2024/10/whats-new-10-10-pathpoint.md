New Relic has released a new version of Pathpoint, built on an entirely new code base that features significant enhancements and AI capabilities. First introduced in January 2024, our new version of New Relic Pathpoint helps different teams understand business health, from frontline teams like customer support and product managers to business analysts and C-level executives.  New Relic Pathpoint provides deep business insights and a more intuitive user experience so you can visualize the stages, steps, and signals for different business journeys in complex environments.

New features include:

* **Intuitive UX:** No-code, entity-centric UX that allows you to instantly add any signal, alert, and service levels to your business flows to simplify business analysis (no need for custom NRQL).
* **Multiple journey modeling:** The ability to model multiple business journeys per instance for deeper insights in complex environments.
* **Playback mode:** Track improvements and the state of your business stages over time so you can more proactively resolve issues.
* **Import and export with audit trails:** Easily move journeys between instances with an audit log for less toil and better version control.
* **Automatically identify instrumentation gaps:** Close blind spots and have a more complete view of your digital business processes.
* **AI driven insights:** Fully integrated AI alerting and anomaly detection for real-time insights and fast root cause analysis.
