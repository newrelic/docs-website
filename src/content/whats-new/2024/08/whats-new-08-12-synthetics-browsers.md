Simple browser, scripted browser, and step monitors can now be configured to test multiple browsers (Chrome and Firefox) and emulated device configurations (Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet). This allows you to improve synthetic monitoring coverage for the browser and device types used by your customers without needing to create duplicate synthetic monitors.

## Get started

This exciting new capability is available for both new and existing synthetic monitors using [our latest synthetic runtimes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime/).

## Private location requirements

Please update Synthetics Job Manager to release-400 and Synthetics Node Browser Runtime to v3.0.0 or newer to start using Firefox and multiple emulated device profiles on private locations.
