Customers on the [New Relic Compute](https://newrelic.com/pricing/compute) consumption pricing plan can now customize how often your data visualizations update with the refresh rate option. This feature allows you to personalize your dashboards further to suit your specific needs, ranging from refreshing every 5 seconds to every 24 hours. 

This configuration option also allows you to control and manage costs, ensuring that you only pay for the value you receive. For example, you may want to refresh critical charts every 5 seconds, while keeping less frequently visited charts on a longer refresh cycle.
