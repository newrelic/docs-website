You can now view logs related to a Kubernetes deployment directly in the Kubernetes deployment view, making it easier to explore related logs without having to manually search through log data.

To get started, open a Kubernetes deployment view and click the **Logs** tab. A logs view will open where you can explore logs related to your Kubernetes deployment. 

In addition, we have added the **Mini Overview** widget to the Kubernetes deployment summary page, allowing you to view the total log count and the error log count associated with your Kubernetes deployment. This widget contains the **See logs** button, which opens up the logs in context view for that Kubernetes deployment.
