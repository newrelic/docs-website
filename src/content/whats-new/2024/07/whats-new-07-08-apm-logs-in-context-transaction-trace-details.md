You can now view logs related to span-based transaction traces directly in the transaction trace details view, making it easier to explore related logs without having to manually search through log data.

To get started, open the transaction trace details view for any span-based transaction trace and click the new **Logs** tab. A logs view will open where you can explore your logs related to the transaction trace. In addition, weâ€™ve improved our logs in context views to show a timeseries of your logs by log level in a stacked bar chart.
