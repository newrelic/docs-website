The new LambdaTest integration and quickstart dashboard make it easier to understand your digital experience testing metrics from LambdaTest alongside the performance insights from across the rest of your stack in New Relic.

[LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) is an AI-powered test orchestration and execution platform for running manual and automated tests at scale. Common use cases for LambdaTest include cross-browser, mobile app, automation, visual regression, load, and security testing. Test websites and mobile applications across 3000+ real browsers, devices, and operating systems to ensure high-quality product delivery.

The integration brings LambdaTest metrics into a pre-built curated New Relic dashboard, and allows you to:

- **Proactively improve digital experiences** by monitoring key metrics such as test executions, durations, failure rates, and errors.
- **Accelerate troubleshooting** with deeper insights into test failures, anomalies, and environments where errors occurred.
- **Build better cross-platform experiences** by gaining insights on website and application compatibility and functionality across thousands of different browsers and devices.
