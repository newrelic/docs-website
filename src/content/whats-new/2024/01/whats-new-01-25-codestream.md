New Relic CodeStream already lets you see relevant observability metrics right in your editor allowing you to stay head off performance issues before they hit production.

And now with unified identity, getting to those insights is easier than ever:

* Install the CodeStream extension for your IDE.
* Sign in using your New Relic credentials.

And thatâ€™s it! Now you access performance insights all the way down to the method-level so you can quickly identify issues before they hit production and accelerate your engineering velocity with shorter development cycles.
