We're excited to announce that you can now monitor the health of your Confluent Cloud Kafka Clusters. This can be done through the new Confluent Cloud integration via API Polling.

Confluent Cloud lets developers to focus on building applications, microservices and data pipelines, rather than on managing the underlying infrastructure. With this integration, you can now monitor your clusters, topics, and brokers with ease.

New Relic lets you create dashboards using this data. In February, we will release a public preview of a new feature called Messages Queues and Streaming, which provides out-of-the-box reports. This feature facilitates a seamless flow from clusters to topics and allow for a deep dive into any APM service utilizing Confluent Cloud for Kafka. Until then, all data are available for use, and custom dashboards can be created and saved. For more information on creating custom dashboards, see the documentation here.
