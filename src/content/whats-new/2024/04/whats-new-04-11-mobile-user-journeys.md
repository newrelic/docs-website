Limited visibility into user interactions before a crash can severely restrict your ability to diagnose errors, understand their root causes, and identify patterns and trends in recurring issues, ultimately preventing you from proactively optimizing the user experience across mobile applications.

To overcome these challenges, we are thrilled to announce New Relic Mobile User Journeys, an integral part of our Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) solutions. This update goes beyond reactive measures by providing a comprehensive view of every user interaction leading up to a crash, thereby enabling teams to anticipate and prevent potential disruptions before they affect the user experience.
