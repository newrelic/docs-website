The Compute Add On SKU enables you to configure and use all of New Relicâ€™s newest innovations, including our recently-launched Live Archives and IAST, while remaining on the data and user model.

You can now adopt our newest capabilities metered in Compute Capacity Units (CCU), without needing to migrate to New Relic Compute, and benefit from:

* **Flexibility**: Option to stay on the data and user model and get access to new use cases via a single SKU.
* **Metering consistency**: The same CCU metering applies to all new capabilities, including tracking, billing, invoicing, and reporting.
* **Governance**: The same Compute Management UI is available when you use the add-on, enabling you to understand, monitor, and control your usage.
* **Simplicity**: The add-on removes the complexity around purchasing separate SKUs, and if you are on a multi-year data and user contract, you can access net new use cases via a single amendment.
* **Usage forecasting**: Get the same value out of existing usage forecasting tools, enabling you to estimate future usage for new capabilities.
