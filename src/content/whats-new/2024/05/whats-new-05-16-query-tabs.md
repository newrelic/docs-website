The new tabbed query builder streamlines your querying experience so you can get more insights without sacrificing speed. Exciting improvements include:

- **No more lost queries**. Explore the platform without the fear of overwriting the queries you've built.
- **No more browser tab switching**. Keep multiple queries in one easy-to-navigate window.
- **Tab management made easy**. Organize your insights by naming your tabs.
- **Faster loading**. Switching between queries is snappier than ever thanks to improved caching.

## Get started

To get query tabs, you'll need to update to the [new querying interface](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2024/02/whats-new-02-21-new-query-experience/). It provides an expandable persistent query which lets you query your data in context, even if you don't know how to use [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).

Go to the [query your data](https://one.newrelic.com/data-exploration) capability and select the **Try it out** button in the banner.
