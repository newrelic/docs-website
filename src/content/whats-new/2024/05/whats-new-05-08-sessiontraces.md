Session traces provide a detailed timeline of events and interactions during a web page's full lifecycle so you can troubleshoot errors, page load times, or web app performance. Starting **June 10, 2024**, session trace data will contribute to your overall monthly product usage. This means it will be charged per your existing order. This change reflects the storage upgrade to the New Relic database (NRDB), which enables longer data retention and improved performance.

We're also providing you with increased control over session trace data collection and associated costs starting **May 8**:

* **Monitor consumption:** See the [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle/#plan-for-paid-consumption) to track your data usage related to session traces.
* **Adjust the sampling rate:** Reduce the number of tracked sessions by modifying the sampling rate in your [browser application settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle/#configure-sampling-rates). This will decrease data ingestion and its corresponding costs. You may do this beginning May 8, as you’ll want to better understand your session trace footprint before making adjustments.   
* **Disable session traces:** Session traces can be entirely disabled through the [browser application settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-traces-explore-webpages-life-cycle/#configure-sampling-rates) if you no longer require access.

If you make no changes, we’ll continue collecting up to 90 session traces per hour per browser entity.
