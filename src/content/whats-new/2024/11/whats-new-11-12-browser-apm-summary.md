We're excited to announce that New Relic APM 360 now seamlessly integrates key browser telemetry data, giving you a holistic view of your entire application stack. This empowers you to monitor backend services (infrastructure, logs, transactions) alongside crucial user experience metrics â€“ all in one place. With browser telemetry integration in APM 360 you can:

**Pinpoint Front-End Issues:** Track JavaScript error rates and identify the top error messages impacting your users. Drill down into individual errors, analyze stack traces, and see how many users are affected.

**Gain User Insights:** Leverage session replay to understand how users navigate your application. Open stacked views of recent sessions, identify potential roadblocks caused by errors, and filter for specific sessions based on your needs. 

**Optimize Web Performance:** Gain valuable insights into core web vitals metrics, which directly impact user experience and SEO ranking. Monitor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores and quickly see if your web app needs performance improvements.
