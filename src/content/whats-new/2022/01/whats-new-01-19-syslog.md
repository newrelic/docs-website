# Understand how your network impacts your infrastructure and application layers.
## Correlate Syslog messages with the rest of your observability data.

* Analyze Syslog messages alongside SNMP and Network flow logs across all network equipment with other network, infrastructure, and application telemetry.
* Automatically detect Syslog-based anomalies (using Lookout) before they cause problems.
* Surface patterns and potential issues with zero-configuration Log Patterns.
* Stay in compliance with our FedRAMP-certified solution.
