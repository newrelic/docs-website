## Build performant Kubernetes workloads by understanding how multi-cluster performance impacts your apps

1. Analyze workload performance across all your clusters in a single, curated UI.
2. Get alerted with a real-time activity stream for K8s events and critical issues.
3. Correlate performance anomalies across clusters with one-click logs and side-by-side (selectable) metrics.

## How to get started

Go to [**APM**](https://onenr.io/08dQea8qYQe), or on the left hand navigation, select **Kubernetes**. Alternatively, you may follow along manually using our [Kubernetes integration docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/kubernetes-summary-page/).

Note that in order to see Kubernetes performance data in New Relic, you must meet these prerequisites:
1. You've installed the New Relic [infrastructure integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm)
2. You are using [APM](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/)
3. Users must be [full platform users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)
