Today, New Relic is excited to announce support for OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) version [0.18.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/releases/tag/v0.18.0). A number of enhancements have been introduced to the protocol since New Relic [announced](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/open-telemetry-support-ga) general availability for OTLP a year ago on version 0.10.0. Importantly, the logs data model was declared stable in version 0.18.0. The data models for the other signals, traces and metrics, were decleared stable in prior releases. At this time, JSON encoding has not yet been declared stable. Another exciting enhancement available in version 0.18.0 is the addition of exponential histograms. Exponential histograms provide better representation for high density distributions of measurements like response times with little to no configuration required. Learn more by reading our recent blog post on [OpenTelemetry exponential histograms](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/opentelemetry-histograms). Finally, some fields have been added, changed, and removed from the protocol in this version. For the cases where fields were changed or removed, we've taken measures to provide backwards compatibility despite breaking changes. For more information, read our documentation on [OpenTelemetry version support](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-versions).
