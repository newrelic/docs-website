The new **DBmarlin integration and the DBmarlin quickstart dashboard** for New Relic make it easier to monitor the functionality and performance of your databases alongside the rest of your observability data. 

[DBmarlin](https://www.dbmarlin.com/) brings deep database performance and change monitoring to the New Relic platform so that developers, testers, SRE engineers as well as database administrators can understand *why* database performance is slow and *how* to improve it.

The quickstart sends database performance data, including database time, top SQL statements, and top wait events, from DBmarlin to New Relic. It also comes with a pre-built dashboard so you can see when database slowdowns occur and what is causing them.

## Benefits

* Monitor database performance, track changes, and help your databases run fast.
* Easy and consistent monitoring for CockroachDB, DB2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQL Server, self-hosted or in the cloud. 
* See how changes to your code, user load, infrastructure, or some other event impacts performance.
* Capture SQL statement text and wait events so you can see exactly where the time is spent executing SQL within your database. 
* Auto-detect changes to schema objects, database parameters, and execution plans so you can see their impact on performance.
