Built for developers who want to know how their deploys are impacting site performance for users, the New Relic plugin for Netlify enables you to automatically install [New Relic browser monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) agent and notifies New Relic each time [a build event](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/create-plugins/#plug-into-events) occurs in Netlify. Get critical insights via [real user monitoring (RUM)](https://newrelic.com/products/browser-monitoring) into the performance of your jamstack application.

Doing so gives you the following benefits:

* Understand how each deploy impacts your site's performance metrics in production.
* Measure Google Core Web vitals on your site like largest contentful paint, first input delay, and cumulative layout shift.
* Quickly discover and fix errors before they impact your users. 
* Explore your data using our custom-built dashboards, and receive alerts and notifications when thereâ€™s an issue with your Netlify site. 

## How to configure plugin with New Relic

Open the [Instant Observability (I/O) quick start](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability/netlify/5861d7f5-26c0-43ad-bda8-c893c4b27b25/) for a guided installation that will also deploy an example dashboard. Alternatively, you may follow along manually using our [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/netlify-plugin).
