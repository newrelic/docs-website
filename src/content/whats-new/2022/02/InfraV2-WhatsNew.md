## New infrastructure monitoring is generally available today

New infrastructure monitoring interface makes it easy to find and compare possible infrastructure components.

**Highlights**
1. Pinpoint bottlenecks instantly using New Relic Lookout to know where to focus your attention.
2. Be proactive and find potential infrastructure issues before they affect your customers.
3. Quantify blast radius and determine the impact of an incident by visualizing the up and downstream dependencies using automap. Use timewarp to find what and when the issue occurred.
4. Investigate root cause by analyzing related entities, logs, alerts, events, golden signals, network metrics, processes, storage and more all in context a unified experience to identify the root cause and resolve issues faster.

[Automap](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps/) shows topology and the blast radius. [Timewarp](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps/#timewarp-cursor) helps to find what and when an issue happened.

With our new infrastructure monitoring experience, we’ve doubled down on providing real-time troubleshooting workflows while incorporating broader platform context and unique topology visualizations into our user experience.

Check out our new infrastructure monitoring experience and tell us what you think. New Relic full platform access users across all regions can start using it today without any additional cost. Find it in New Relic One within the main menu under **[Infrastructure > Hosts New](https://onenr.io/08dQepE9Wje)**.
