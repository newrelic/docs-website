Starting today, New Relic automatically detects and exports sampled and aggregated data from Pixie for long-term retention from various technologies, including Kafka, DNS, MySQL, RabbitMQ, PostgresQL, and Redis. 

If you are using Pixie with New Relic with either the Kubernetes integration v2.0.0+ or the Pixie-New Relic Plugin v1.4.2+, no need to do anything else! You should already see entities from your environment directly in your New Relic environment.

If you arenâ€™t using Pixie with New Relic yet, get started easily by installing the Kubernetes + Pixie integration using [the guided installation path](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure).
