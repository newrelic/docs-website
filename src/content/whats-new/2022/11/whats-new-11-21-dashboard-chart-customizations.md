# New chart customization options
New Relic dashboards let you analyze telemetry data across your entire stack, regardless of the source. Dashboards are a flexible way for engineering teams to visualize data however they want by combining pre-made templates, native platform visualizations, custom queries, and moreâ€”all in one place.

Now there are more ways to upgrade your dashboards, including:
- **Markdown widget:** Add rich custom content to your dashboards such as links, checklists, tables, and text formatting.
- **Custom colors:** Highlight key information or choose a preferred color palette for each data series.
- **Null value options:** Four options to display, transform, or remove null points.
- **Unit labels:** Increase chart detail and clarity with custom units per series.
- **Override time picker:** Analyze different time ranges in a single dashboard.
