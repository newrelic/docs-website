Recently, we launched [New Relic Monitoring for SAP Solutions](https://newrelic.com/solutions/sap), where you can now inspect all of your SAP and non-SAP systems through one centralized view of your infrastructure, application, and business processes.

Now you will be able to:
* **See SAP application performance and overall health data in one place.** Your telemetry metrics, events, logs, and traces all come together in a central view within our UI.
* **View your data in relation to your business processes.** Understand your infrastructure and application data from the viewpoint of your corresponding business processes, such as order-to-cash and procure-to-pay.
* **Spot problems quickly with visualizations.** By querying and viewing relevant data in our customizable charts and dashboards, you can identify root causes and resolve problems.
* **Prevent problems before they occur.** Use our advanced alerting functionality to be notified about problems before they impact your customers.
* **Install monitoring centrally for end-to-end visibility.** This tool can be installed on a central monitoring server, so you wonâ€™t need to install agents on all of your SAP production servers.
