Some types of infrastructure data and real user monitoring (RUM) data will now display in APM to help you troubleshoot issues and optimize performance. 

## Infrastructure data in context 

New Relic now displays information about your hosts directly on the APM **Summary** page. You can see which hosts are causing issues without having to navigate away from the summary page. For deeper troubleshooting and performance analysis, you can view the **Hosts** page for more information on which processes are running and the latest events that have occurred. Check out the [infrastructure monitoring docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring) to get started.

## Real user monitoring data in context

New Relic gives you frontend page view information in associated transaction traces so you can quickly identify how severely issues are impacting your users. In addition to quick metrics like total page views and average response time, you can jump to **Page views** in New Relic for deeper analysis. Check out the [browser monitoring docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring).
