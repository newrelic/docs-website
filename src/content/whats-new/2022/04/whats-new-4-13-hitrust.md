<Callout variant="caution">
New Relic has discontinued the use of the HITRUST framework for attesting to our HIPAA compliance. New Relic now relies on our third party HIPAA attestation as evidence of compliance with HIPAA standards and controls. New Relic provides the list of “HIPAA Covered Services,” which may be referenced in the applicable business associate agreement, on this successor [HIPAA page](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/certificates-standards-regulations/hipaa/).
