CodeStream users can now access instant observability of the functions they write on their Python code with code-level metrics for the New Relic CodeStream integration. With this update, users will be able to see Googleâ€™s golden signals alongside the Python code open in their IDE, making it easier to directly identify opportunities within their repository to improve their error rate, latency, traffic, and saturation. This improvement makes it easier optimize the performance of an application and fix customer-impacting issues proactively.
