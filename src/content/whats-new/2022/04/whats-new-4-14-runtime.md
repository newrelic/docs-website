  There's no bigger headache to an organization than when end-users express frustration over the user experience! Good thing it's an avoidable problem.

 Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively test flows through your application so you can identify and resolve performance issues quickly, before they negatively impact your end usersâ€™ experience. Today, we announce the release of next-generation runtime for synthetic monitoring, which includes updated functionalities to easily test user flows in your production environment and catch potential issues.

  Our next-generation runtime supports the latest version of Chrome (version 100) and unlocks the testing of modern applications requiring newer Chrome versions; the new synthetics runtime also makes browser version updates easier and more frequent. Additional capabilities include use of the got Node request module, async / await support, and a custom timing library, allowing you to explore new synthetic monitoring use cases by reducing required monitor complexity. 

  With the next-generation runtime, you can spin up monitors with fewer lines of code, maintain browser compatibility over time, and more effectively detect and fix performance issues before they affect end-users. Learn how to set up your synthetics monitors in our new runtime with this quick tutorial:
