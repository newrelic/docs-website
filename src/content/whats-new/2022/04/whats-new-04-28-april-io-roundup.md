## Cloudflare Network Logs

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is an industry-leading global network designed to make everything you connect to the Internet secure, private, fast, and reliable. The new [Cloudflare Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/) integration sends Cloudflare data directly into New Relic, resulting in faster log delivery and eliminating cloud storage middleware costs. The [Cloudflare Network Logs quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/cloudflare/fc2bb0ac-6622-43c6-8c1f-6a4c26ab5434) allows you to monitor and analyze web traffic metrics from Cloudflare Logpush on a New Relic dashboard, providing you with an overview of important logs and metrics from all your websites and applications.

## Netlify Logs

As a pioneer of the Jamstack movement, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) brings together modern web frameworks, serverless functions, and edge computing into one platform to deliver unmatched experiences for your application users. With the [Netlify Logs quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/netlify-logs/63f08781-18ad-4a89-ae63-49718deee041), you can explore and visualize data from traffic and function logs provided by [Netlify log drains](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/log-drains/). It allows you to parse, view, and filter traffic logs and function logs generated by your Netlify workloads for in-depth analysis, performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and alerting within New Relic.

## Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) helps more than 17 million developers collaborate and create better APIs. The [Postman quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/postman/d465bf08-b737-4bc5-b5ad-dd5be272967b) provides Postman monitoring data to New Relic, so that DevOps, APIOps, and ITOps engineers can get instant observability into critical metrics such as latency, request counts, and error rates to collaborate better. The integration also ingests data from New Relic into Postman to bring observability data to API producers, testers, and consumers.
