Introducing the public preview for our IBM MQ integration to monitor the performance of MQ objects like connections, channels, and queues. Analyze metrics over time to scale accordingly and keep your infrastructure messages and data flowing throughout your stack.

IBM MQ enables decoupled applications and services to communicate and exchange data in a reliable and scalable way, whether you're trying to integrate applications running in different frameworks, languages, platforms, clouds, or locations.
