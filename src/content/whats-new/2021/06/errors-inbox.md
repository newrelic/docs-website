**What’s Included with New Relic Errors Inbox:**

- **Errors Inbox.** Errors are grouped and displayed on a single screen for visibility and easy triaging. Filter to just the applications and services that you care about.
- **Rich Error Details.** Resolve errors faster with context of the full stack, including APM, Browser (RUM), Mobile, and Serverless (AWS Lambda Function) data. Error data persists to provide continued context for recurring errors.
- **Log Data.** Logs in Context are provided alongside other error data right in the error group details for even more information to resolve errors faster.
- **Cross Team Collaboration.** Work errors as a team with shared error visibility, shared comments, and an integration with Slack.
