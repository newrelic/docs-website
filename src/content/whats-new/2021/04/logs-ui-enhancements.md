In collaboration with our customers, we’ve made significant changes in the Logs UI. With this new intuitive design, now you can efficiently find and use advanced features directly from your main screen. We’ve also dedicated more UI space to logs making it easier to see the details and debug faster. 

This updated experience also includes colorization of key messages, a message preview, expanded dashboard visualization for displaying long log messages directly in dashboards, and more!
