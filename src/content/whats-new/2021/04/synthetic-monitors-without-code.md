[Synthetic monitors](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/synthetic-versus-real-user-monitoring/) are vital to ensuring your customer-facing websites are available, functional, and performing optimally. That’s why we’ve released several updates that make it easier for you to set up synthetic monitors quickly and **without code.** We also improved the building experience and integrated it with Lookout for full visibility on a single screen.

## What's new:
- **New "step" monitor type:** A step monitor allows you to set up a monitor without code. Now more users in your organization can create monitors.

- **Quickstarts library:** This ever-growing list of [pre-built scripts](https://newrelic.github.io/quickstarts-synthetics-library/#/) for synthetic monitors is community-sourced. Now you don’t have to start from scratch when building monitors.

- **Visualize synthetic monitors in Lookout:** Visualizing the state of all synthetic monitors is easy in [New Relic Lookout](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-lookout-monitor-your-estate-glance/).

- **New view for easier monitor creation:** We launched a new look for monitor creation that is more visually appealing and does a better job of walking you through the monitor creation process. Note that the new step monitor is **only available** in the new view. If you don’t see the new monitor type, it's possible you need to click **Show new view** to see the new UI.
