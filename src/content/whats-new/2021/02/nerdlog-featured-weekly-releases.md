## Optimize your Snowflake warehouse performance, security, and costs

Senior Solutions Consultant Daniel Fitzgerald showed us how the [New Relic Snowflake Integration](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration) helps teams optimize their Snowflake warehouse performance, security, and costs by using New Relic Alerts and NRQL queries to monitor and alert on custom Snowflake data. To set up the Snowflake integration, follow the instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration) or read [Daniel's blog](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/new-relic-snowflake-integration/).

## Visualize and share k6 performance data

Solutions Architect Gary Spencer showcased how teams can visualize and share [k6 performance data](https://k6.io/) in New Relic dashboards, compare load impact with system performance, and alert on metrics with the New Relic StatsD integration.
