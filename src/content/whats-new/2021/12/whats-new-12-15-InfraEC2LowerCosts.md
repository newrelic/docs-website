## AWS and New Relic: Better Together
Whether you are just getting started on AWS or cloud native technology, New Relic One delivers the end-to-end observability that is critical to your success on the cloud. New Relic utilizes a single data platform for all metrics, events, logs, and traces and delivers the ability to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire AWS environment.

## Lowering costs for our customers
Since introducing consumption-based pricing in July of 2020, we have been looking for ways to reduce our customers’ costs through efficiency.

All AWS EC2 users using Infrastructure Monitoring will see a slight decrease in their Telemetry Data Platform costs. However, for customers that use Amazon EC2 custom tags, the reduction will be higher. Both are enabled by increased backend improvements to store and manage the data and reduce the storage footprint while maintaining all the UI functionality. These reductions will vary depending on usage.

* The changes are effective beginning December 15th, 2021.

**Note:** No customer action is required. The improvements are automatic and only on the New Relic side. An infrastructure agent update is unnecessary.

## Ongoing improvements
As we continue improving and evolving our consumption-based business model, we expect to deliver additional cost savings to our customers over time. We are delighted to bring this improvement to you and actively optimize costs.
