## AWS and New Relic: Better Together
Whether you are just getting started on AWS or cloud native technology, New Relic One delivers the end-to-end observability that is critical to your success on the cloud. New Relic utilizes a single data platform for all metrics, events, logs, and traces and delivers the ability to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire AWS environment.

## Lowering costs for our customers
Since introducing consumption-based pricing in July of 2020, we have been looking for ways to reduce our customers’ costs through efficiency.

All AWS EC2 users using Infrastructure Monitoring will see a slight decrease in their Telemetry Data Platform costs. However, for customers that use Amazon EC2 custom tags, the reduction will be higher. Both are enabled by increased back-end improvements to store and manage the data and reduce the storage footprint while maintaining all the UI functionality. These reductions will vary depending on usage.

* The changes are effective beginning December 15th, 2021.

**Note:** No customer action is required. The improvements are automatic and only on the New Relic side. An infrastructure agent update is unnecessary.

## Ongoing improvements
As we continue improving and evolving our consumption-based business model, we expect to deliver additional cost savings to our customers over time. We are delighted to bring this improvement to you and actively optimize costs.
