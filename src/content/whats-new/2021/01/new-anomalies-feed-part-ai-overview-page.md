A demo of how to explore system anomalies from **Alerts & AI > Overview** in New Relic One.

In this new tab you can quickly focus on the areas that matter most to you with easy filtering by state, application name, config name, or anomaly type. You can even select an area of the stacked bar chart to filter to a specific time window to see the state of your system's anomalies.

To see and explore the anomalies in your system, navigate to **Overview** within **Alerts & AI**, then head to the **Anomalies** tab.
