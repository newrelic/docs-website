To resolve issues affecting a cluster of services in your architecture, you need to identify both where AND when issues originate. Today, with New Relic One Automap, you can. 

When selecting a service, you can locate Automap in the **Related entities** section of the slide-out panel. Click the **Map view** button. Then, using Automap **Timewarp**, you can step backward in time and understand how the issue propagated through the architecture and track the issue back to where and when it all started.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps/) to learn more.
