## Accelerate government IT modernization
​
Protecting your data is our highest priority, which is why we achieved the US Government’s rigorous FedRAMP Moderate certification in 2020. And now we’re adding support for Logs and Metrics to our long list of supported services.
​

New Relic’s FedRAMP authority to operate enables US federal government customers (and those that work with the federal government) to get the same level of real-time insights as commercial organizations, while still ensuring compliance with established security standards
​

Access to New Relic’s FedRAMP environment is based on the following:
​

1. Your account must be specifically approved by New Relic.
2. You must send your data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints.
