Log messages are unique in their patterns and length, and we leveraged a new custom visualization feature to create an easy way to add log messages to your dashboards. Using this new feature, long log messages with lots of attributes can wrap, and columns can easily be resized. To use this feature just click on the icon in the top right of the of the log messages panel.
