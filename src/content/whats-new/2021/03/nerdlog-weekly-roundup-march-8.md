## **Finding anomalies with New Relic AIOps**

Sr. Product Manager Devin Cheevers shows how our Anomalies feed can help give you a great overview of any changes or issues within your system. Learn more about anomalies [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/#anomaly-overview) and view your anomalies [here in New Relic One.](https://one.nr/0PoR8ZZPXQG)

## **Using AI to find correlated failures**

Principal Product Manager Nate Heinrich shows us how anomalies and alerts can be automatically correlated with other data sources via [incident intelligence.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence)

## **Smart alert muting**

Sr. Product Manager Brian Goleno shows us how to use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations, which is visible in Applied Intelligence. Learn more about muting rules [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) and [enable muting rules in New Relic One](https://one.nr/037jbWWYbQy)

## **Custom data visualizations**

Sr. Software Engineer Jewels Nocera gives us a detailed overview of creating custom visualizations to display data exactly how you want in New Relic One.
