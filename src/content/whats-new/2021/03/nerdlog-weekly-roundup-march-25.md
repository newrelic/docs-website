## New Relic Lookout: Embrace the purple bubble

Lindsy Farina, Senior Product Manager, and Andrew Ettinger, Senior Software Engineering Manager, demonstrate how New Relic Lookout helps you dive deep into anomalous behavior (that don’t have set alerts), analyze any data in the [Telemetry Data Platform](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/introducing-telemetry-data-platform/) (including third-party, open, and custom data), and proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale.

3. Click on a highlighted circle to get important details like activity, tags, and key metrics. 

## Guided install: Remove the anxiety from instrumentation

Justin Eveland, Software Engineer, shows us how guided install works to help you  instrument your applications and infrastructure to start seeing your data in New Relic within minutes. With a single CLI command, guided install discovers all the systems running on your hosts and recommends automatically instrumentation options to you. Recipes are stored in YAML files in our [Open Install Library](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library), allowing you to modify them or even build your own for your own unique instrumentation needs.

## Open source docs: Fork these docs
