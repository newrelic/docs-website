## Key Information for Users

**Action Required:** None. These updates are purely cosmetic and will be applied automatically to your workspace.

**Operational Continuity:** Your existing alert conditions, workflows, and account permissions will continue to function without interruption.

**Visual Update:** Starting 16th February 2026, all visual references to "Incidents" within the New Relic UI will transition to "Alert events."

## Background

This shift supports a streamlined flow: individual **Alert events** are correlated into **Issues**, which can then be triaged to determine if they warrant a formal Incident response. This evolution ensures our platform remains intuitive and consistent with the industry's direction, providing you with a clearer path from initial signal to resolution.

Soon we will be introducing the formal concept of an Incident on the New Relic platform, which will round out the three-part flow and align our platform terminology with common ITSM practices as we develop more incident management and response features. By aligning our language across the platform, we are making it easier for you to navigate and manage your operational health and identify real problems faster.

## What's changing

**Updated terminology**

We are updating naming across the following areas to ensure a unified and simplified experience and pave the way for more incident management features on the New Relic platform:

* **Alert condition builders**: The term "Incident" will be changed to "Alert event" across all alert condition building and editing experiences.

* **Decisions UI**: Terminology within the Decisions capability—including builders, previews, logic samples, and tooltips—will be updated. For example, "Entire incident" will now be labeled "Entire alert event."

* **Muting rules**: All visual references to "violations" and "incidents" within Muting Rules configuration and management views will be updated to "Alert events."

* **Workflows & notifications**: Terminology within Workflow configurations and notification templates (email, Slack, etc.) will reflect the new "Alert event" standard.

* **Admin panel**: Access management roles and account-level privileges will be updated from "Incident" to "Alert event" for better clarity.

* **Issue page**: All visual references on the Issue details page and associated views will be renamed to "Alert events."
