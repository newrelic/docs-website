New Relic is excited to announce the general availability of Workflow Automation, a powerful feature that enables you to automate routine tasks and incident responses without writing code. Connect New Relic with AWS, Slack, and any HTTP API to build workflows that respond to alerts, manage infrastructure, and streamline operational tasks.

## Automate your operational workflows

Workflow Automation transforms how teams respond to incidents and manage infrastructure by embedding intelligent automation directly into your observability platform. Build workflows that automatically remediate issues, integrate with your existing tools, and execute complex automation logic—all without leaving New Relic.

## Key features

* **Multiple trigger options**: Start workflows from alerts, on-demand via API, or on schedule using cron expressions for complete flexibility in how automation runs.

* **No-code workflow builder**: Use the drag-and-drop interface to chain actions, add conditional logic, loops, and data transformations without writing a single line of code.

* **Pre-built templates**: Deploy ready-to-use workflows for common scenarios including Slack notifications, deployment rollbacks, EC2 auto-scaling, and more.

* **AWS integration**: Connect directly with AWS services to manage EC2 instances, API Gateway deployments, and other cloud resources in response to alerts.

* **Approval gates**: Add human oversight to critical workflows—request team confirmation before executing production changes or infrastructure modifications.

* **Version control**: Automatically track workflow versions with the ability to pin specific versions for scheduled executions, ensuring stability while you iterate.

## Common use cases

* **Incident response**: Automatically resize infrastructure, roll back failed deployments, or restart services when alerts fire—reducing MTTR without manual intervention.

* **Infrastructure management**: Scale services on schedules, manage AWS resources, and execute runbooks automatically based on your operational needs.

* **Enhanced notifications**: Send enriched alert data to Slack, generate scheduled reports, and format data to integrate with ticketing systems like Jira or ServiceNow.

* **System integrations**: Connect to any HTTP API, sync data across platforms, and update external systems based on New Relic observability data.

## Pricing and availability
