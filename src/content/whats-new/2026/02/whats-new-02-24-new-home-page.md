## Your personalized launchpad

The new homepage is built to be your starting point for the day.

  - **Scope your view**: Use the **Select entities** button to choose the specific services you find yourself checking most often.
  - **Performance-minded limits**: You can scope your view to include up to **500 entities** across all your accounts to maintain high performance.
  - **Private customization**: You can personalize your homepage as much as you want—your changes are private and won't affect anyone else in your account.

## Spot issues with system health

The Your system health section provides a real-time summary to help you spot exactly where your attention is needed.

  - **Health summaries**: View a clear count of **critical**, **warning**, and **operational** alerts, along with entities that have **no alerts set up or are not reporting data**.
  - **Status filtering**: Use the filter tool to focus only on specific health states, such as critical and warning, to clear away unnecessary information.
  - **Direct entity access**: Use the health icons to quickly identify and navigate to specific entities.

## Correlate change with performance

The **What's changed** widget provides a timeline of events to help you troubleshoot faster.

  - **Event timeline**: Track **issues**, **deployments**, **error groups**, and **synthetics failures** in one place to see how they line up over time.
  - **Interactive discovery**: Click on any event to see more information and navigate directly to the relevant place in the UI for deeper troubleshooting.
  - **Zoom to focus**: Zoom into problematic areas by brushing across the visualization to see a more granular view of the event timeline.

## Dashboards at your fingertips

Your favorite dashboards are now front and center, acting as a quick-reference guide for your most critical metrics.

  - **Custom cover charts**: You can change the cover charts of your favorite dashboards to see specific data points at a glance without opening the full dashboard.
  - **Easy access**: Track the dashboards you use most often and navigate to them with a single click.

## Consolidated global favorites

The **All your favorites** widget provides a single destination to access your most important assets from across the New Relic platform.

  - **Access everything**: Quickly find any favorite entity, whether it's an APM service, a dashboard, or a specific host.
  - **Recently viewed**: Toggle to the **Last viewed** tab to immediately return to the entities you were working on most recently.
  - **Local filtering**: Use the widget-specific filter to sort your favorites by type, such as **APM & services**, **Alerts & AI**, or **Infrastructure**.
