Weâ€™ve created a Gantt-style chart that shows a timeline of related events on the Incident Intelligence issue page, within Applied Intelligence, to help you understand how incidents play out over time and relate to each other.

The timeline is available to all accounts that have configured Incident Intelligence. Click **View Visual Timeline** and scroll over individual incidents for more information.
