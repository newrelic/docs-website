A new season represents a time for change. As we reflect on the past few months at New Relic, we’ve had quite a few changes of our own. In July, we [simplified our pricing model](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/simple-pricing/) and [reimagined New Relic One](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/reimagined-new-relic-one-experience/). Since then, we’ve released 40+ new features, capabilities, and integrations to help you deliver value to your customers.

To recap this season, we’ve asked our engineers and product managers to list [their favorite features](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/jerome.plg-whats-new-launcher) to help you be more productive and collaborative.

Here are the top 10:

## 1. Dark mode

When you're resolving incidents in the middle of the night or want to avoid straining your eyes, you can view New Relic One in dark mode. Dark mode is way more than just a cool feature (though it still is that). For many industries, dark mode is essential.

## 2. New AWS integrations

Get end-to-end visibility into your AWS cloud services and the rest of your stack with valuable new integrations:

- [AWS Lambda Extensions](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-lambda-extensions-integrations/) make it substantially easier to send telemetry data from AWS Lambda to New Relic One.
- [AWS Control Tower](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Marketplace/solutions-center/downloads/New-Relic-AWS-Control-Tower-Implementation-Guide.pdf) automatically integrates with New Relic One for single or multi-account environments enrolled in AWS Control Tower.
- [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-distro-for-opentelemetry/) uses the OpenTelemetry Collector and New Relic exporter to send telemetry data from your AWS services to New Relic One.
- [AWS X-Ray integration](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-x-ray-integration/) automatically combines traces from AWS managed services with traces from New Relic for end-to-end observability visualized entirely within New Relic One. You can capture, filter, and query it all—no manual instrumentation required.
- [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/amazon-kinesis-data-firehose/) helps you ingest and forward CloudWatch Logs data into New Relic One to expand the insights into your cloud stack.
- [AWS Bottlerocket](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/aws-bottlerocket/) helps provide full visibility into workloads and infrastructure, including Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS in New Relic One.

New Relic also achieved [AWS Outposts Ready Designation](https://newrelic.com/press-release/20200915), which recognizes that New Relic One offers complete visibility into AWS compute, storage, database, and a full range of other available AWS services in the AWS regions.

If you build, deploy, or maintain apps and critical workloads on AWS, you can now get full, instant access to all of New Relic One for free, and only pay for what you use beyond 100 GB per month when you [subscribe to New Relic in the AWS Marketplace](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/free-observability-plan-aws-marketplace/).

## 3. OpenTelemetry UI

New Relic One now has a UI dedicated to providing full APM functionality for your OpenTelemetry data. Send your OpenTelemetry data to New Relic using one of the [OpenTelemetry exporters](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/new-relics-opentelemetry-integration) and quickly discover and analyze your data to optimize the performance of your applications and services using one of seven key pages.
