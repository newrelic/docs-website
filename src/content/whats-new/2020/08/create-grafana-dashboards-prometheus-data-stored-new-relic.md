We’ve teamed up with [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com) so you can use our platform as a data source for Prometheus metrics and see them in your existing dashboards, seamlessly tapping into the reliability, scale, and security provided by New Relic.

Follow the steps below or [use this more detailed walkthrough](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/grafana-dashboards-prometheus-telemetry-data-platform/) to send Prometheus data to New Relic, so that Grafana can populate your existing Prometheus-specific dashboards with that data.

This process requires Prometheus version 2.15.0 or higher and Grafana version 6.7.0 or higher.

You’ll also need to [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup/).

Here's an example of how these Grafana dashboards with Prometheus data look in our new dark mode.

### Step 1: Get data flowing into New Relic with the Prometheus remote write integration

Go to [Instrument Everything – US](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJ0dWNzb24ucGxnLWluc3RydW1lbnQtZXZlcnl0aGluZyJ9) or [Instrument Everything – EU](http://one.eu.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJ0dWNzb24ucGxnLWluc3RydW1lbnQtZXZlcnl0aGluZyJ9), then click the **Prometheus** tile.

You can also go to the [Prometheus remote write setup page](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJwcm9tZXRoZXVzLXJlbW90ZS13cml0ZS1pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1uZXJkbGV0cy5zZXR1cC1wcm9tZXRoZXVzIn0=) to get your `remote_write` URL.

### Step 2: Configure your Grafana dashboards to use Prometheus data stored in New Relic
