We listened to you about what’s working and what’s not. That’s why we [reimagined New Relic One](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/reimagined-new-relic-one-experience/) by unifying all of our capabilities within a single experience, completely removing the barriers to observability. Easily navigate the platform and take advantage of powerful, new and improved features like search, a feature toggle, an Alerts & AI section, a feedback form, the ability to add data, and more!

We also [embraced open source observability](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/introducing-open-source-agents-and-projects/) by adopting open standards and sharing our traditionally closed-source code with the community.
