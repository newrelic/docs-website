We've expanded early access for [New Relic AI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-ai/), the industry's first generative AI observability assistant.

This preview offers an early taste of what New Relic AI will be able to do once it becomes generally available. Here are some of the capabilities that you can explore during this preliminary release phase:

* Translate plain language into New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries, run NRQL queries, and render the results in plain language or visualize them as a chart or graph.
* Synthesize how-to guides based on our extensive [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/).
* Surface New Relic Lookout insights/anomaly data in response to root cause analysis (RCA)-style prompts.
* Summarize and get recommendations for open dashboards.
* Understand and fix errors in CodeStream.

Eligible customers can get early access to New Relic AI today upon acceptance of the pre-release agreement, which encompasses both the New Relic [pre-release policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/) and [Generative AI service specific terms](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/service-specific). If you haven't already enabled New Relic AI on your account, you can view and accept the pre-release agreement by selecting the **Ask AI** button at the top right corner of your screen.
