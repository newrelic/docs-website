Schedule [monitor downtimes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/) to specify times that your synthetic monitors shouldn't run, stopping alerts and preserving SLA report metrics. 

With the updated monitor downtime experience, you can: 
* Schedule monitor downtime windows that span more than 24 hours.
* Manage monitor downtime configurations programmatically using [NerdGraph](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#monitor-downtimes).
* View relationships between synthetic monitors and monitor downtime configurations using [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/service-maps/) and [entity relationship NerdGraph queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/#list-relationships).

**Next Steps**
* Check out our docs for the monitor downtime [UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-downtimes-disable-monitoring-during-scheduled-maintenance-times/) and [API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#monitor-downtimes) information.
