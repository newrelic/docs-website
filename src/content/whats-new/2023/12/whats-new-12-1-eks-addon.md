Monitor your AWS EKS Clusters with [New Relic EKS integration](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gcywa6keq2ajy), available on AWS EKS Marketplace. New Relic offers end-to-end visualization on cluster metrics and events, and our new add-on eliminates the time consuming process of installing the helm charts manually.

Installation of the New Relic EKS integration offers the following advantages:

- **Check health of your nodes in your cluster:** Monitor the status of each node and the resources available to them, such as CPU and memory usage.
- **Customizable CRDs:** Create Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to enable/disable various pods as per the monitoring requirements.
- **Detailed events:** View detailed Kubernetes events to monitor health of the cluster.
