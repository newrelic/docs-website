We’ve rolled out errors inbox custom fingerprinting, which enables you to group errors according to your needs, resulting in a faster error triage and prioritization process by streamlining the error groups that you need to focus on, leading to lowered MTTR and more cost savings.

With this enhancement, you’ll get:

- **Simplified error prioritization and triage:** Reduce inbox clutter by creating your own custom groups by simply using a call-back function or naming a group via a custom attribute.
- **Faster set-up:** Simple implementation in minutes to help you prioritize the right issues you need to resolve before it affects your customer.
