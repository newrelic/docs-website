We are excited to announce a new feature that simplifies the onboarding experience for our users. New Relic now seamlessly integrates with Google for user log in and sign up, giving you the power of Google's secure authentication technology to manage access to our services.

**Main updates:**

* You can now log in and sign up on New Relic with your Google or Google Workspace account, enabling a secure and quick authentication process.
* This integration helps reduce password fatigue, allowing you to centrally manage access to New Relic and other services that support Google authentication.

**Key benefits:**

* **Single sign-on (SSO)**: With this integration, new users never have to remember multiple sets of credentials to experience the New Relic platform.
* **Simplified onboarding**: Inviting new team members to New Relic with their Google accounts is now a breeze.

**How to use**:

1. Go to the [New Relic login page](https://login.newrelic.com/login).
2. Click on the **Sign in with Google** button.
3. Select your Google account, and grant New Relic the requested permissions.
4. For new users, complete the onboarding process.
