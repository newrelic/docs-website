**Main updates:**

* You can now log in and sign up on New Relic with your Google or Google Workspace account, enabling a secure and quick authentication process.
* This integration helps reduce password fatigue, allowing you to centrally manage access to New Relic and other services that support Google authentication.

**How to use**:

1. Go to the [New Relic login page](https://login.newrelic.com/login).
2. Click on the **Sign in with Google** button.
3. Select your Google account, and grant New Relic the requested permissions.
4. For new users, complete the onboarding process.
