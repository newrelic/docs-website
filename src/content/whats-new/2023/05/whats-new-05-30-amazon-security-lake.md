New Relic launched an integration with Amazon Security Lake, so you can collect multi-region, multi-account security data from across your microservices infrastructure and analyze that data in New Relic. By sending Amazon Security Lake logs to New Relic, you get a more complete understanding of security across your entire organization to protect your workloads and data.

Amazon Security Lake collects logs across multiple Virtual Private Clouds and AWS accounts. The easy one-time setup in New Relic brings AWS Security Lake logs into four dashboards developed specifically for these AWS sources:

* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) flow logs
* Amazon CloudTrail
* AWS Security Hub
* Amazon Route 53

While New Relic already supports most of these features individually, Security Lake allows you to keep up with all of these security features across multiple accounts, and in a single data stream into New Relic.
