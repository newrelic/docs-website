The New Relic infrastructure agent can be easily distributed across thousands of Amazon EC2 instances and on-premise servers using AWS Systems Manager Distributor, simplifying the process of deploying and maintaining the agent lifecycle. This integration provides AWS customers with a more streamlined approach to monitoring their AWS environments, allowing them to easily and securely install and configure the New Relic agent across their instances. 

**Key features include:**

* Native experience: Configure directly in the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or any AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tooling.
* Automation: Install on both existing and new instances during scaling, automatically.
* Hassle-free updates: Ensure the latest version of our infrastructure agent is always deployed.
