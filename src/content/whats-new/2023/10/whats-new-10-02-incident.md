### Simultaneous current and historical signal data

With this feature, you can now view both the real-time status of your signals and access comprehensive historical data all on one page. No more jumping between screens or endless clicks. We've streamlined the process to make it more efficient and user-friendly.

### Deployment markers

As an extra addition to the incident chart, we've introduced deployment markers. You can now see related entity deployments as a gray marker on the chart. Hovering over it will provide you with a tooltip containing relevant details about the deployment, such as the entity name, deployment description, and deployed version.

### Enhancing incident investigation 

Introducing this feature and a tool to access a more extensive historical record and the current state of signal behavior will enhance users' capacity to investigate incidents. It will also streamline the process, reducing the number of clicks required to access critical data and consequently saving users valuable time. 

We are committed to continually improving our platform and providing you with the best possible experience. This new feature will significantly enhance your ability to analyze signals and incidents, making your incident management process more efficient and effective. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts. We're always eager to hear your feedback and suggestions for future improvements.
