Logs can provide valuable information about what is happening to the entities that make up your systems. New Relic allows you to view your logs in relation to the health and performance measures that are already being collected from these components, and now you can see those logs in the context of deployments, alerts, and any other operational events you are tracking.

At a glance you can correlate logs with these operational events to provide greater detail about them, allowing you to troubleshoot problematic deployments or to quickly uncover the cause of an incident.
