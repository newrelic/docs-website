If you're already using, or plan to use, OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 at scale, it's important to monitor metrics like average request time, total requests, and total cost. Doing so can help you ensure that services using ChatGPT, GPT-3, and GPT-3.5 are working as expected, especially when those services are required for important functions like customer service and support.

Companies around the world are embracing GPT-3 to power help desk tickets and live chat logs, develop content and images, and accelerate semantic searches. New Relic monitoring for OpenAI is fast, easy to use, and unlocks real-time metrics that can help engineering teams optimize usage, reduce costs, and achieve better results.

## New Relic integrates with GPT-3 and OpenAI to provide the following benefits:

* __Get started for free:__ Access to New Relic Instant Observability and our out-of-the-box GPT-3 monitoring solution is the first of its kind, and included at no additional cost to all New Relic full platform users.
* __Easy installation:__ With just two lines of code, users can import the monitor module from the `nr_openai_monitor` library and automatically generate a dashboard that displays a variety of key GPT-3 performance metrics.
* __Monitor cost:__ Usage of OpenAI’s Davinci model costs $0.12 per 1000 tokens, which can add up quickly and make it difficult to operate at scale. New Relic provides engineering teams with real-time cost tracking of their GPT-3 usage.
* __Optimize performance:__ New Relic gives engineering teams insight into the average response time and other key performance metrics around GPT-3 requests, allowing engineers to optimize usage and ensure the best possible response times.
* __Analysis prompts and response:__ New Relic provides valuable information about the usage, speed, and effectiveness of GPT-3 to help engineering teams achieve better results from their ML models.

## How to get started

With just two lines of code, simply import the monitor module from the `nr_openai_monitor` library and automatically generate a dashboard that displays a variety of key GPT-3 and GPT-4 performance metrics such as cost, requests, average response time, and average tokens per request.

To get started, simply install the [OpenAI Observability quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/openai) from New Relic I/O or visit our [library repo](https://github.com/newrelic/nr-openai-observability) for further instructions on how to integrate New Relic with your OpenAI apps and deploy the custom dashboard.
