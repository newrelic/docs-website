## The New Relic Windows Services integration is now GA

We’re excited to announce the general availability of New Relic infrastructure’s Windows Services integration. Customers with a subscription to New Relic can now pull data from their Windows services directly into New Relic without installing any third-party software.

Windows Services is a core component of the Microsoft Windows operating system and enable the creation and management of long-running processes

This on-host integration allows you to track key metrics and gain critical insights into how your services in Windows are performing.

## Key benefits
* Check all your Windows services, their state (running, stopped, etc.), start mode (auto, manual, etc.), and other service metadata thanks to the New Relic Explorer or our NRQL engine.
* See which hosts are running specific Windows services.
* Set alerts based on any Windows services that you are monitoring using New Relic.
