As of February 28, 2023, New Relic Synthetics supports device emulation in simple and scripted browser monitors–so users can simulate mobile and tablet users, allowing engineers to spend less time manually testing their applications on multiple devices and more time proactively resolving issues before they affect customers.

As a natural extension of our best-in-class synthetics monitoring, this new feature saves time and reduces the risk of missed issues, resulting in a more efficient development process and an improved user experience for mobile and tablet users.

Synthetics Device Emulation allows users to:
◦ Proactively improve performance and reliability of your web applications by monitoring discrepancies in uptime across mobile, tablet, and desktop device types, all in one place.
◦ Reduce screen swivel, cost, and testing time by simulating mobile and tablet UX in pre-prod to solve issues before it affects your customers and your bottom line.

![Getting started is as easy as selecting the device type (mobile or tablet) and orientation (portrait or landscape) you want to emulate when you create your simple browser or scripted browser monitors. Just as easily, you can modify existing checks](./images/device.webp "A screenshot showing the device emulation setting.")
