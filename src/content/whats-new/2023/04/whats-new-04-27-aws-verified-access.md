Amazon Web Services (AWS) now offers a simple, secure way to connect to your corporate applications through a web browser. Currently, IT teams rely on VPN policies, identity based policies, and device based policies to validate access. This requires multiple teams to ensure secure access is maintained at all times. To reduce this overhead burden, AWS has launched AWS Verified Access which provides zero trust connectivity and zero trust network access, allowing you to work from anywhere and by-passing the need to rely on VPN for access to your corporate applications. 

With this integration, verified access logs are sent to New Relic so that every access request, whether allowed or denied can be displayed on a unified dashboard, which customers can use for troubleshooting, auditability, compliance, or to investigate security incidents.
