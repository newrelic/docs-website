Our Java Agent release 8.1.0 -released on April 13th- provides out of the box instrumentation for **Spring Web 6.0** and **Spring Webflux 6.0**.
Spring Web versions older than 6.0 are subject to vulnerability [CVE-2016-1000027](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1000027) and we encourage our customers to upgrade their Spring frameworks and java agent releases to benefit from security updates and the newest features!

Our new Java Agent release provides also out of the box instrumentation for the [**Kafka Streams API**](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/introduction.html). Get more information out of your Kafka applications with the additional insights and data our instrumentation now provides!
