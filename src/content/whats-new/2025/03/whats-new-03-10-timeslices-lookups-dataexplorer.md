The [data explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-new-data-explorer/) makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without requiring knowledge of NRQL or building queries. It allows you to access all data stored in the New Relic database (NRDB) in a quick, intuitive way.

Now, we've added Timeslice Metrics and Lookup Tables to the data explorer so you can easily explore an even broader range of data in one place!

## Timeslice Metrics
Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type reported by our APM, browser, and mobile agents. Now, you can easily explore timeslide metrics in the data explorer by selecting "Timeslices" in the data type dropdown menu.
