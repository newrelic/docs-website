We're simplifying the process of sending notifications to Microsoft Teams. You can now integrate New Relic with Teams to receive critical alerts and updates directly in your channels. Previously, customers needed to configure a webhook or design a workflow within Microsoft Teams using the Workflows app to send alert notifications. With the new integration, you can easily install the [New Relic for Microsoft Teams app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/Office365/WA200008155) to connect and send notifications directly to Teams channels in just a few clicks.

To get started, check out our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/get-notified/microsoft-teams-integrations).
