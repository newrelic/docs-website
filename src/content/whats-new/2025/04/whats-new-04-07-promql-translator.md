New Relic allows you to store and analyze all telemetry data, whether they come from New Relic Agents or third-party sources, such as Prometheus. Previously, you had to use the old Query Your Data capability to translate PromQL queries, rather than the [new unified query console](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2024/02/whats-new-02-21-new-query-experience/) that allows data exploration in context throughout the platform.

Now, the new query experience includes support for PromQL queries, making it easy to explore your Prometheus data, without needing to go to a separate querying experience or knowing how to write the NRQL query.

Now, the new query experience includes support for PromQL queries, making it easy to explore your Prometheus data, without needing to go to a separate querying experience or knowing how to write the NRQL query.To access the PromQL Translator, you can simply:

1.  Open the query console and select PromQL from the three-dot menu
2.  Enter your query in PromQL and select the desired time step and ranges
3.  Select the **Translate**, then **Submit** button to use the translated NRQL query
