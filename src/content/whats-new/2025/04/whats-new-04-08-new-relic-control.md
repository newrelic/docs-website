Managing observability in complex infrastructures is challenging due to vast amounts of data, manual instrumentation updates, and fragmented tooling. New Relic Control simplifies this by centralizing and automating the entire observability lifecycle.

As announced at [New Relic Now+](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2025/02/whats-new-02-25-new-relic-now-product-announcements/), New Relic Control integrates three core components -- Fleet Control, Agent Control, and Pipeline Control -- into a single, unified platform, enabling DevOps and Platform teams to easily deploy, configure, and optimize agents and telemetry data across any environment.

### Fleet Control (Public Preview)
Fleet Control simplifies observability agent operations by enabling centralized, remote command of fleets of managed entities running Agent Control, such as Kubernetes clusters.

### Agent Control (Public Preview) 
Agent Control acts as a lightweight supervisory agent to remotely manage infrastructure-level instrumentation on Kubernetes clusters. It keeps your agent configurations up-to-date and consistent while continuously monitoring agent health in real time.

### Pipeline Control (Generally Available)
Pipeline Control provides sophisticated yet intuitive filtering to help you optimize telemetry data before it reaches New Relic. Choose Pipeline Control **Gateway** with a dedicated Kubernetes cluster to get full control over your environment and reduce network egress costs, or select Pipeline Control **Cloud** for a managed, hassle-free solution operated by New Relic.
