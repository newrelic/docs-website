We're excited to announce a major update to Error Inboxâ€™s filtering system and data display, designed to make your error tracking experience more intuitive and powerful.

## New Filter Bar:

Our completely redesigned filter bar brings a cleaner interface and enhanced filtering capabilities:

- **Improved Search Placement:** The search bar now sits prominently at the top for easier access
- **Intuitive Filter Addition:** Adding multiple filters is made more easy with the new '+' icon
- **Simplified Logic:** All filters now use AND logic for more precise results 
- **Backward Compatibility:** All your existing permalinks with previous filter settings will continue to work seamlessly
