As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline interactions with the Data Exploration and Query Builder products across the platform, we are removing the 'Query Your Data' capability from the menu as an access point for Query Builder and Data Explorer.

Starting April 30, 2025, Query Builder and Data Explorer will only be accessible via the console at the bottom of the platform.

### New and improved querying interface
The new querying UI combines the chart editing features of the old query builder with the portability of the old NRQL console. The enhanced user interface helps you:
-  **Explore your data with context.** Troubleshoot faster with a persistent, resizable query bar as you navigate across the platform.
-  **Explore data without NRQL knowledge.** Generate queries with the [point-and-click data explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2024/11/whats-new-11-11-data-explorer/), translate from PromQL, or simply ask questions with natural language to enable anyone from your team to get answers from the data.
-  **Multi-task better with query tabs.** Use up to 100 query tabs to streamline data exploration.

### Next Steps for You 
This change does not require any action for your side. Starting April 30, you will no longer be able to access the Query Builder and Data Explorer as a pinned capability from the left menu. Instead, you can access them through the console at the bottom of the platform UI.
