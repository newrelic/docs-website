In order to ensure the best service to our customers, New Relic will change the IP ranges for New Relic Synthetics checks **effective April 14, 2025.**

If Synthetics traffic is part of your allowlist, **you will need to update your configurations** to maintain monitor connectivity. 

Failure to update your allowlist by **April 14, 2025**, may result in your synthetic checks failing to connect to your applications, potentially causing disruptions and alerts. 

**NOTE:** If you do not allowlist by IP range, no action is required.

## What’s changing?
We will be migrating the IP address range for the New Relic service used by Synthetics public locations to align with our standard IP ranges used across other data ingest. 

## What action is required?

* Before **April 14, 2025**, update your allow lists with the new IP ranges provided below.

  **New IP ranges to allowlist:**

  * `152.38.128.0/19`

  * `212.32.0.0/20`

  * `64.251.192.0/20`

* After **April 14, 2025**, remove the old IP ranges from the allowlist. Failure to do so may result in failed connections and trigger alerts.

**Old IP ranges to remove:** Please refer to the table below for a complete list of current IP ranges **that need to be removed after April 14, 2025**.
