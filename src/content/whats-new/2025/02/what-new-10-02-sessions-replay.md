Tired of worrying about who can access and change your **Session Replay** settings? We're excited to announce a significant update to our **Session Replay** feature, offering users enhanced control over who can access and modify settings. This update introduces tailored roles, allowing product admins to create custom permissions specifically for **Session Replay**, ensuring a more secure and efficient management process.

## Why this is a big deal

Organizations with large teams have expressed challenges in managing access to **Session Replay** settings, particularly concerning unintended changes to settings like the sampling rate that lead to increased data ingest and costs.

## Key Features

With this update, users can now:

- **Define Tailored Roles:** [All Product admins](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#standard-roles) can create custom roles with **Modify** permissions exclusively for **Session Replay**. This allows for precise control over who can adjust critical settings, eliminating the need for all-or-nothing access.
- **Precision Control:** Users with the **Modify** role can access **Session Replay** settings directly within the **Application Settings** page. They can fine-tune the sampling rates, mask sensitive text, and block site content, optimizing performance and protecting sensitive data.
- **Seamless Experience for Everyone:** Existing **Session Replay View/Read** users will continue to enjoy an uninterrupted experience viewing session listings. The settings will be hidden from them, ensuring a clean, focused workflow. If a Read user was previously responsible for updating settings, they will need to contact an admin to be moved into the **Session Replay Modify** role.

This update empower teams to manage **Session Replay** settings with greater precision and security, aligning with their operational and compliance needs. By providing these enhancements, we aim to improve your workflow efficiency.
