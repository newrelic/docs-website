Template variables are already a powerful tool for filtering an entire dashboard based on creator-selected metadata. Nested Variables take this further by allowing you to create dependent relationships between them. This enables you to:

- Create parent/child relationships: Form a tree-like structure for multi-level filtering.
- Reuse and dynamically change variables: Efficiently filter data based on other variables' selections.

## Key features [#key-features]

- Parent/Child relationships: Establishes hierarchical links between variables.
- Dynamic data changes: Automatically updates displayed data.
