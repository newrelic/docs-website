New Relic AI is your observability and problem-solving assistant, allowing you to discover problems, troubleshoot issues, and explore your telemetry data using plain language—all directly inside the New Relic platform or via natural language interfaces on other platforms, such as GitHub Copilot and ServiceNow NOW Assist. Powered by advanced AI models and New Relic’s tried-and-true observability features, New Relic AI brings speed, clarity, and automation to everyday engineering and reliability tasks.

## Key things to know about today’s news:
- New Relic AI experiences on the New Relic platform are **generally available (GA) as of June 4, 2025**. Agentic Integrations, which connect users to New Relic AI capabilities from other platforms like GitHub Copilot and ServiceNow, will remain in preview until July 15, 2025.
- Some AI capabilities now **consume Advanced Compute Units (aCCUs)**, which means you will need to have New Relic’s Advanced Compute SKU to continue using New Relic AI beyond GA.
- **Unlike many copilots, New Relic AI is not shelfware**. You only pay for what you use — most New Relic AI features are triggered manually.
- You can track all AI usage transparently through your Compute Usage dashboard.

During the preview period, all AI usage was free. Starting at GA, specific New Relic AI capabilities will begin consuming aCCUs.
