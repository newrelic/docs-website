Transaction 360, New Relic’s industry-first transaction-centric observability solution, is now generally available, empowering DevOps and engineering teams to resolve business-critical incidents faster with a full-stack, correlated view of all relevant components across your application ecosystem.

Today's distributed systems—spanning AI models, databases, and microservices—demand more than siloed dashboards and 15-minute snapshots. Transaction 360 offers real-time and historical visibility into the full lifecycle of critical digital transactions, reducing data overload and accelerating root cause analysis.

What sets Transaction 360 apart:
* Dynamic workload creation: Automatically aggregates all telemetry and entities related to failing transactions into one unified view.
* End-to-end trace flow map: Combines distributed and transaction tracing for an unsampled, full-stack view over days or weeks, not just minutes.
* Contextual change analysis: Visualizes deployment and configuration impacts on performance across services.
* AI-powered anomaly detection: Proactively surfaces issues before they escalate using intelligent alerting.
* Faster MTTR: Eliminates dashboard-hopping and guesswork during high-impact incidents.
