The New Relic query console, located in the drawer at the bottom of the UI across the entire platform, allows you to query and analyze all telemetry data, including logs. Previously, you had to use the separate Logs capability to view log details. Now, the [new unified query console](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2024/02/whats-new-02-21-new-query-experience/) integrates log details view, enabling you to effortlessly explore your logs data without needing to write NRQL.
