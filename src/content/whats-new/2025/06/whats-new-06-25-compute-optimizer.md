As New Relic transitions to a consumption-based pricing model, efficiently managing your compute usage is paramount. The new New Relic compute optimizer is designed to empower you with intelligent, actionable insights to precisely manage your compute spend and implement effective cost controls. It helps you identify and optimize inefficient alert conditions and queries, leading to significant potential cost savings, improved query efficiency, and a more streamlined New Relic experience.

Key things to know about todayâ€™s news:
- Compute optimizer is generally available (GA) as of June 25, 2025, now accessible to all customers within your New Relic account.
- This tool provides clear, practical recommendations to reduce your compute consumption, directly addressing concerns around usage governance and uncontrolled costs.
- Easily identify areas of inefficient compute usage, starting with alert conditions, and receive specific guidance on how to optimize them for maximum CCU savings.
- You can transparently track your optimization opportunities and potential savings directly within the compute optimizer dashboard in the Admin panel.
