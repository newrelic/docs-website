We are excited to announce that Errors Inbox now sits within Workloads, a simple-yet-powerful change designed to help you proactively detect, triage, and resolve errors with greater context and efficiency. By integrating Errors Inbox directly within your Workloads, you can now focus on the errors that are most relevant to the services and entities you care about without leaving the Workloads section, streamlining your incident response and reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

## What's Changed:

The new scoped view is now available on the secondary level navigation within Workloads - allowing you to see only the errors that are impacting the specific entities within a defined workload. This means you can cut through the noise and immediately identify issues that are relevant to your team's area of responsibility.

This enhancement streamlines your error management by allowing you to:

* **Faster troubleshooting:** By narrowing the scope of error analysis, you can pinpoint the root cause of issues more quickly without much context switching, all within workloads. 

* **Improved team collaboration:** Scoped Errors Inbox for Workloads allows your team to now have a shared view of the errors affecting their services, leading to better collaboration and a more efficient workflow for incident response.


## How to Get Started:

To start using Scoped Errors Inbox for Workloads, simply navigate to any of your existing Workloads in New Relic. The "Errors" tab will now be available, providing you with a scoped view of all the errors within that workload. If you haven't created a workload yet, you can easily group your entities and create one to start taking advantage of this new feature.
