New Relic introduces Cardinality Controls, a solution that helps you manage dimensional metrics as your data needs grow. You can now purchase additional account cardinality beyond the standard 15 million metric limit, with expanded capacity up to 200 million metrics per account.

This feature eliminates unexpected costs when you hit cardinality limits. Instead of facing service disruptions, you can scale your observability data based on your actual usage and budget. Cardinality Controls gives you flexibility to optimize your monitoring investments while maintaining complete visibility into your systems. For more information about cardinality management, refer to [Manage cardinality](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/cardinality-management/).
