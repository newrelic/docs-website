New Relic's Transaction 360 is the industry's first transaction-centric observability solution designed to streamline troubleshooting—automatically correlating components, telemetry, and change data into a single, unified view.

Modern applications have become increasingly complex, featuring interconnected services and diverse components like serverless functions and AI models. Traditional monitoring tools often struggle to deliver the unified visibility required to diagnose issues, forcing teams to switch between multiple dashboards. This fragmentation slows down troubleshooting, increases MTTD/R, and leads to extended downtime.

New Relic's Transaction 360 solves this by providing a holistic, "east-to-west" view of your business-critical transactions. By combining transaction tracing and distributed tracing, it aggregates everything you need—APM, Browser, Infrastructure, alerts, and deployment changes—into one consolidated, context-rich experience.

## A single view for business-critical transactions

* **Correlated observability:** Get a comprehensive view showing all services involved in a transaction's journey automatically, without additional instrumentation.
* **Reduce data overload:** Automatically aggregate entities and telemetry for problematic transactions, cutting through the noise to help you identify issues faster.
* **View and analyze related changes in context:** Quickly understand the impact of recent deployments and configuration changes by viewing aggregated data across relevant entities to pinpoint the cause of slowdowns or errors.
* **Accelerate troubleshooting:** Eliminate context switching with a comprehensive, full-stack, cross-trace view that spans extended historical periods rather than limited snapshots.

## What makes Transaction 360 stand out

* **Unified transaction-centric observability:** Combine all monitoring elements across different environments and data types with a single click.
* **Automatic Dynamic Workload Creation:** Automatically aggregate entities, alerts, and changes for problematic transactions into one dynamic workload view.
* **Comprehensive Trace Flow Map:** Leverage combined distributed tracing (DT) and transaction tracing for an unsampled flow map that spans days or weeks.
* **Instant root cause analysis:** Isolate the impact of deployments immediately to enable faster rollbacks or fixes.

## Proactively prevent issues

Manual monitoring of complex transactions is often reactive. Transaction 360 incorporates advanced, AI-powered anomaly detection to identify potential issues before they escalate. Automated alerts ensure rapid team engagement, dramatically reducing the mean time to detect and respond (MTTD/R) and safeguarding user experience.
