As organizations scale their cloud-native infrastructure, the number of Kubernetes clusters often grows rapidly. Managing these environments individually creates silos, making it difficult for Platform Engineers and DevOps teams to understand the overall health of their fleet. Constantly switching contexts between different cluster views to identify issues is inefficient and cumbersome, often leading to delayed mean time to detection (MTTD).

New Relic introduces the Cross-cluster UI Public Preview to solve this fragmentation. This new experience delivers a centralized "single pane of glass" for your entire Kubernetes fleet, allowing you to visualize, filter, and compare the health of all your clusters in one place. By aggregating key metrics and status indicators, teams can now identify cascading issues or regional outages instantly without navigating through multiple browser tabs.

**Cross-cluster UI capabilities:**

* **Unified Fleet Visibility:** View the health status and key metrics of all your Kubernetes clusters in a single, sortable list.
* **Global Filtering:** Quickly narrow down your view by filtering across all clusters using attributes like region, environment, or team labels.
* **At-a-glance Health Indicators:** Instantly spot clusters with alerting conditions or resource bottlenecks using color-coded health statuses.
* **Seamless Drill-down:** Navigate from the high-level fleet view directly into specific cluster dashboards for deep-dive troubleshooting with a single click.

By unifying fleet-wide observability, you can **accelerate root cause analysis** with a guided triage workflow, **reduce costs** by identifying wasted resources, and **empower developers** with an application-centric view for self-service. This experience supports clusters monitored with the [Kubernetes integration provided by New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration/) and also our [OpenTelemetry monitoring for Kubernetes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-solutions/kubernetes/opentelemetry-kubernetes/).

To get started, navigate to the **Kubernetes** option in the main New Relic menu and click the blue **"Try it out"** button located in the top right corner of the page.
