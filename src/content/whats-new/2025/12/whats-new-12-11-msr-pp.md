We are excited to announce the Public Preview of Mobile Session Replay. This new capability allows you to review replays for your mobile apps synced with detailed telemetry data, giving you the context needed to understand user interactions and resolve issues faster.

## What is Mobile Session Replay?

Mobile Session Replay provides a visual reproduction of user interactions within your mobile application. Unlike standard crash reporting, it allows you to review high-fidelity replays that are perfectly synced to detailed telemetry data, giving you a complete picture of the user journey alongside the technical performance data.

## Why Mobile Session Replay?

Understanding user behavior is crucial for optimizing website usability and improving user experience. With Mobile Session Replay, you can:

* **Troubleshoot faster with full-stack visibility:** Review replays synced to detailed telemetry data for faster troubleshooting to deliver better customer experiences.
* **Industry-leading Privacy & Security:** No PII is collected out-of-the-box. Fully customizable masking and sampling settings can be updated server-side and are not dependent on latest app adoption.
* **Only record replays your teams care about:** Use errored-session sampling to only record sessions when something breaks, or take full control and start/pause replays with the API.

## Get started

Mobile Session Replay is available on the latest agents for iOS, Android, and React Native apps.
