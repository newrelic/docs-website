We have refreshed the access management experience to make securing your observability data faster and more intuitive. You can now manage granular permissions for *all* access grant types (Organization, Account, and Group) seamlessly within a unified interface.

## Simplified access grants

We have streamlined the workflow for assigning permissions to make it easier to manage how users access your data. You can now create all access grant types-whether for an Organization, Account, or Group—directly from the **Access grants** tab.

This update removes the need to navigate the "Edit group" modal, providing a straightforward path for getting your user groups set up. 

## Full role management in the UI

You can now create all role types directly from the **Roles** tab. This update brings full management capabilities into the user interface, giving you a comprehensive visual builder for your permissions.

When creating a role, you can easily toggle between setting a role scope for the Organization, specific Accounts, or single entities. Today, Fleets are the only entity that you can create access grants for, and we will \continue to enable more entity-scoped access grants for finer-grained access control of your assets. This new experience gives you fine-grained control over your entities without leaving the administration dashboard.

## General interface improvements

To ensure a consistent experience, we have also cleaned up the **Accounts**, **Groups**, and **Data access policies** tabs. These updates align with the new design, making it easier to scan, search, and manage your access configurations in one place.
