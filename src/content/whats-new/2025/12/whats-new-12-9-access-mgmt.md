We've refreshed the access management experience to make user and access management faster and more intuitive. You can now manage granular permissions for *all* access grant types (Organization, Account, and Group) seamlessly within a unified interface.

## Simplified access grants

We've streamlined the workflow for assigning permissions to make it easier to manage how users access your data. You can now create all access grant types-whether for an Organization, Account, or Group—directly from the **Access grants** tab.

This update removes the need to navigate the "Edit group" modal, providing a straightforward path for getting your access grants configured.

## Full role management in the UI

You can now create all role types directly from the **Roles** tab. This update brings full management capabilities into the user interface, giving you a comprehensive visual builder for your permissions.

When creating a role, you can toggle between setting a role scope for the organization, specific accounts, or single entities. Today, you can only create entity-scoped access grants for your New Relic fleets. We will continue to enable more entity-scoped access grants for finer-grained access control of your assets. This new experience will give you fine-grained control over your entities without leaving the administration section.

## General interface improvements

To ensure a consistent experience, we've also cleaned up the **Accounts**, **Groups**, and **Data access policies** tabs. These updates align with the new design, making it easier to scan, search, and manage your access configurations in one place.
