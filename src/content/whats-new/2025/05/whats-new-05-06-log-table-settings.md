Searching through logs to find that needle in the haystack or singular value in a log attribute can be a difficult proposition when considering the verbosity of logs. To address this, we've introduced powerful new customization options for your log table view.

You can now tailor how you scan and investigate your logs to significantly improve your efficiency. Choose to view log entries in a condensed, single-line format for rapid scanning across numerous logs, or opt for an expanded view to see more of your log at a glance.

Furthermore, when diving into the details, you can select between an inline expanded table row â€“ which will automatically format detected JSON objects in the log message field. Or you can choose a side panel view which opens the full log detail in a slide out.

These enhancements give you greater control over how you interact with your log data, making it easier than ever to pinpoint critical information and understand complex log structures.
