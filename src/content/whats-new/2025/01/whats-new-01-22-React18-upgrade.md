summary: 'Upgraded UI framework to React 18 for enhanced performance'

We have heard your feedback and have made key improvements to our UI, which have been in progress since January 16, 2025. As part of these enhancements, we are upgrading the UI framework from React 17 to React 18. This important upgrade will provide you with efficient, up-to-date tools and performance enhancements.

We've conducted testing to help ensure a smooth update for our main product, as well as the most widely used programmability apps, such as Pathpoint v2, and third-party visualizations, like the Status Widget and Victory Charts. However, we recognize that some of our you may have custom-built applications using our programmability extension. While we've worked diligently to minimize potential impacts, there could still be unforeseen issues affecting these custom applications due to the update.

**Action Required**: No action is required from you at this time, and your services should be functioning as expected. However, if you have built a custom application, we recommend verifying that it is performing as expected.

If you have any questions about these changes, please ask in Explorers Hub, our free support forum.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to enhance our platform. Your efforts to test your custom applications contribute significantly to ensuring a smooth transition. Thank you for your attention and assistance in this matter.
