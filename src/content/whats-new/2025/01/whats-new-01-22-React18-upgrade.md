We have heard your feedback and have made some key improvements to our UI that have been upgraded starting on January 16, 2025. We will be upgrading the UI from React 17 to React 18, and this important upgrade will provide customers with efficient and up-to-date tools and performance improvements.

We've conducted thorough testing to help ensure a smooth update for our main product as well as the most widely used programmability apps, like Pathpoint v2, and third party visualizations, like the Status Widget and Victory Charts. However, we recognize that some of our customers may have custom-built applications using our programmability extension. While we've worked diligently to minimize potential impacts, there could be unforeseen issues affecting these custom applications due to the update.

**Action Required**: Nothing is required from you at this time and your Services should be functioning as expected. However, if you have built a custom application, we recommend checking that your custom application is performing as expected.

If you have any questions about these changes, please ask in Explorers Hub, our free support forum.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to enhance our platform. Your efforts to test your custom applications contribute significantly to ensuring a smooth transition. Thank you for your attention and your help on this matter.
