Unify your AI agents with a single, standard bridge to your observability data

New Relic is excited to announce that the **New Relic AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** is now available in public preview as of **November 4th, 2025**. This update provides a standardized, scalable way to connect your favorite AI development tools directly to the rich context of the New Relic platform, breaking down data silos and accelerating AI-driven operations.

## Getting started:

Navigate to the **Previews & Trials** page in the New Relic UI and enable the **New Relic AI MCP Server preview**. 

**MCP**: A centralized bridge for AI-driven observability

Historically, connecting AI agents to observability platforms meant building complex, custom integrations for each tool. This **integration sprawl** creates significant development and maintenance overhead.

The New Relic AI MCP server solves this. It acts as a single, centralized bridge, allowing your AI agents to retrieve powerful context and tools from New Relic using one consistent protocol. This helps you and your AI:

* **Troubleshoot faster**: Analyze error logs and find probable causes with AI-powered insights.
* **Automate operations**: Perform tasks like checking alert statuses or generating incident reports.
* **Simplify queries**: Ask questions in plain English, and the MCP server converts them to NRQL to get results—even if you're not a NRQL expert.

## What's New in public preview

This public preview expands on our initial offering with key updates:

* **More approved partners**: We've grown the ecosystem, allowing you to connect New Relic to more of the AI development environments you already use.

* **More tools**: The MCP server now provides an expanded set of tools and capabilities for your AI agents to use, enabling richer queries and more powerful automation.
