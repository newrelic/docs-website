When a log-based alert fires, the race to find the root cause begins. Sifting through thousands of log lines to find the "why" is time-consuming and stressful.

We're excited to introduce **AI Log Alert Summarization (Preview)**, a new feature in our Logs Intelligence suite. Instead of just notifying you of a problem, this feature provides an immediate hypothesis for *why* it's happening.

### How it works

When an alert issue is triggered by log conditions, the AI summary automatically analyzes over 100,000 log entries for the triggering entity from the contextual time window. It then gives you a clear, actionable summary right in the alert issue, including:

* **What happened:** A detailed summary of the potential cause of the incident.
* **Findings:** 3-4 key patterns, anomalies, or potential causes.
* **Recommendations:** Detailed recommendations to go with each finding. 

This analysis helps you understand the potential cause and resolve incidents faster by surfacing the critical information from thousands of logs in seconds.

To join the preview, login to New Relic select your account in the bottom left and select Administration -> Previews and Trials. Once in the Previews page find AI Log Summarization and accept the terms to get started.
