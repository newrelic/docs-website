We are excited to announce the General Availability (GA) of enhanced database performance monitoring. Now you can get deep query-level details—including slow queries, wait types, and execution plans—directly from your MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server instances.

This update empowers DBA and infrastructure teams to find and fix performance bottlenecks faster, without relying on APM agents.

## Key features [#key-features]

* **Empower DBAs:** Give database owners the query-level tools they need, independent of application instrumentation.
* **Pinpoint bottlenecks:** Move from identifying a slow query to understanding *why* it's slow with detailed wait types and explain plans.
* **Unified hybrid monitoring:** Standardize monitoring across your entire estate, including self-hosted databases and AWS Aurora/RDS.
