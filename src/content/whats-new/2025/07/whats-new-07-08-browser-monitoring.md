We're excited to roll out a significant upgrade to how you interact with your Browser Page Views and Core Web Vitals data. This isn't just a visual refresh. It's about giving you more control and clarity, enabling you to pinpoint critical performance information faster and more effectively than ever before.

## What's new and how it helps you:
- **Data exploration:** Our redesigned filter bar puts the power of precise data analysis at your fingertips. No more digging around. The quick-access search bar is now prominently at the top, allowing you to instantly begin refining your view.
- **Filtering for focused results:** Need to combine multiple criteria to zero in on a specific issue? The new, intuitive filter addition with a simple **+** icon makes building complex queries a breeze. Plus, with all filters now using the `AND` logic, you'll get more precise and relevant results, cutting down on noise and helping you identify patterns that truly matter for your website's performance.
