New Relic is excited to announce the general availability of Predictive analytics, featuring NRQL predictions and Predictive alerting. These powerful tools  help allow you to anticipate issues before they arise and take proactive measures to  optimize system performance, providing foresight into your system's behavior to enhance your observability strategy.

## NRQL predictions: Visualize future trends
NRQL predictions leverages historical data patterns to forecast future metric trends using the Holt-Winters algorithm and supports both seasonal and non-seasonal time series, making it ideal for metrics with strong trends or defined seasonal patterns. By integrating predictions into your dashboards, you gain a quick visual indicator of where your metrics are headed, enabling timely interventions.

* Monitor increasing logs in production to prevent disk space exhaustion.
* Anticipate memory depletion to avoid container crashes.
* Project future revenue based on observed seasonal and trend patterns.

## Predictive alerting: Proactive issue detection
Predictive alerting complements NRQL predictions by generating alerts when predicted metrics are expected to breach static thresholds. This feature empowers you to address potential issues before they impact your system, enhancing productivity and decision-making.
