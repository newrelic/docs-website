# New Feature: Sort by Newest Errors

We're excited to announce that you can now sort errors in your Errors Inbox by newest first, making it easier to identify and prioritize the most recently occurring issues in your applications.



## How It Works
The new sorting option appears in the Errors Inbox’s Sort By drop-down alongside existing sorting methods - Occurrences and Last Seen. Select "Newest" from the sort drop-down to view your errors with the most recent occurrences at the top of the list.

This enhancement streamlines your error management workflow by allowing you to quickly spot emerging issues and newly introduced bugs. Whether you're monitoring a fresh deployment or investigating recent changes, sorting by newest errors helps you focus on what's happening right now in your applications.


*P.S. The "Sort by Newest" feature will display only the most recent errors that occurred during your selected timeframe. To view the newest errors within a specific timeframe, adjust your time picker to the desired period.*
