Engineering teams that adopt OpenTelemetry (OTel) face challenges such as inconsistent application performance monitoring (APM) experiences, manual data normalization, and fragmented visibility. New Relic’s APM + OTel Convergence addresses these issues by automatically normalizing OTel data to New Relic's APM semantic conventions, providing immediate and consistent visibility.

## Key Benefits:
- **Full APM Functionality for OTel Data:** Instantly access familiar metrics, dashboards, and workflows with OTel signals—no additional configuration or compromise.
- **Quick Start, No Overhead:** Send data directly to New Relic's OTLP endpoint without needing extra agents or exporters.
- **Seamless Migrations:** Easily transition across instrumentation styles and OTel versions without needing to rewrite dashboards or alerts.
- **Unified Platform**: View and monitor both New Relic agent and OTel data in one unified interface.

Start leveraging OpenTelemetry seamlessly within New Relic’s unified platform today.
