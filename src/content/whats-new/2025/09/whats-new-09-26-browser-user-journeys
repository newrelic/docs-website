New Relic is excited to announce that **User Journeys for Browser** is now Generally Available. This innovative tool is designed to help you gain deeper insights into how users navigate your website, enabling you to identify usability issues and bottlenecks with ease.

## What is User Journeys?

User Journeys is a Sankey diagram visualization that provides a clear and concise view of user navigation paths. Unlike traditional Sankey diagrams that adhere to a rigid columnar layout, often repeating the same values across multiple columns, our approach reduces visual noise by displaying each value only once. This unique method uses flexible pathing to represent the different steps at which each value occurs in a user's journey.
