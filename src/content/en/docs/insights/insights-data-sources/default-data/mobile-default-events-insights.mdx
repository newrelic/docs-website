[New Relic Mobile](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-mobile) reports [event data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) that is displayed in some UI displays and is also available for [querying and charting](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

The events reported by Mobile are in the table below. Select an event name to see its attributes.

      </td>

      <td>
        A `Mobile` event is created when a crash occurs, when an interaction ends or has run for 1 second, or if a session completes after the app is closed, backgrounded, or has run for 10 minutes. `Mobile` events were once the only event type and were generated for every event, but now there are several specialized event types. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the most recent New Relic Mobile agent version to take full advantage of the new event types.

        There are no attributes listed for this event because it's a custom event; attributes will include the [session attributes](#session-list) and any [custom attributes added](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/add-custom-data-new-relic-mobile).

        [`MobileCrash`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8357)
      </td>

      <td>
        The `MobileCrash` event is created when an app crashes. `MobileCrash` includes attributes such as crash line number, class, and crash message.

        [`MobileHandledException`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8372)
      </td>

      <td>
        `MobileHandledException` is sent when an exception is caught and is used for non-fatal exceptions reported to New Relic using the `recordHandledException` API call for [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api/recordhandledexception-android-sdk-api) or [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api/record-handled-exception).

        The exceptions will be visible in queries of this event and on the [**Handled exceptions** UI page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes), including stack traces.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [`MobileRequest`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8367)
      </td>

      <td>
        A `MobileRequest` event is created when an HTTP request successfully completes, resulting in a response code below 400.

        To use this event type, you must have Mobile agent version 5.14.0 or higher for [Android](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes) or [iOS](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes).

        New Relic `MobileRequest` data is enabled by default for:

        * [Android version 5.15.2](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5152) or higher
        * [iOS version 6.0.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-600) or higher

        For earlier versions, starting with Android version 5.14.0 or iOS version 5.14.0, you must enable the feature. Upgrade to the latest [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-android-sdk) or [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-ios-sdk) version, or enable the `NetworkRequests` feature flag by using the [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/android-agent-configuration-feature-flags) or [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/ios-agent-configuration-feature-flags#networkRequest) configuration settings.

        [`MobileRequestError`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8362)
      </td>

      <td>
        A `MobileRequestError` is used for HTTP errors or network failures. HTTP errors are HTTP requests that have a status code greater than 400. A network failure is an HTTP request that results in no response. The event is sent when the HTTP request completes.

        For best results, use New Relic Mobile agent 5.14.0 or higher for [Android](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes) or [iOS](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes). With lower agent versions, some attributes may be missing, and you will not have access to `MobileRequest` events.

      <td>
        [`MobileSession`](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary?attribute_name=&events_tids%5B%5D=8352)
      </td>

      <td>
        A `MobileSession` event is sent when an app is closed, backgrounded, or when 10 minutes of active use has elapsed. This is the source of the general session data used by the other New Relic Mobile events. `MobileSession` captures attributes such as device type, device OS, and geographical information.
