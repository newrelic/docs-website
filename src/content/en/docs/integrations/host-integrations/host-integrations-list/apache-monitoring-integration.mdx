Our Apache [integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) sends performance [metrics](#metrics) and [inventory data](#inventory) from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

The integration works by gathering data from Apache's [status module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html), so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in [Requirements](#comp-req)).

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect.

## Compatibility and requirements

Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4.

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements:

* [Apache status module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html) enabled and configured for Apache instance.
* Apache status module endpoint (default `server-status`) available from the host containing the Apache integration.
* If Apache is **not** running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the [infrastructure agent installed](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise:
  * If running on Kubernetes, see [these requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes#requirements).
  * If running on ECS, see [these requirements](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).

## Install and activate

To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ecs-install"
    title="ECS"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="k8s-install"
    title="Kubernetes"
  >
    See [Monitor service running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="linux-install"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Follow the instructions for [installing an integration](/docs/install-integrations-package), using the file name `nri-apache`.
    2. Change directory to the integration's folder:

       ```
       cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
       ```
    3. Copy of the sample configuration file:

       ```
       sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml
       ```
    4. Edit the `apache-config.yml` file as described in the [configuration settings](#config).
    5. [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/start-stop-restart-check-infrastructure-agent-status).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Additional notes:

* **Advanced:** Integrations are also available in [tarball format](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-host-integrations-built-new-relic#tarball) to allow for install outside of a package manager.
* **On-host integrations do not automatically update.** For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

## Configure the integration

The Apache integration configuration is how you can set required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed:

* If enabled via Kubernetes: see [Monitor services running on Kubernetes](/docs/monitor-service-running-kubernetes).
* If enabled via Amazon ECS: see [Monitor services running on ECS](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs).
* If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, `apache-config.yml`.

Configuration options include:

* `metrics`: This command captures the metrics of a particular Apache server. This takes a single argument:
  * `status_url`: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the [Apache status info module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html). Default value: `http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto`. If you have customized your setup to use a different endpoint, you will need to set this value.
* `inventory`: This command captures the modules loaded by Apache as [inventory data](#inventory), using Apache's binary file. To disable the collection of inventory data, delete the inventory command from the config file.
  * `status_url`: The URL is used to attach the inventory data to the same Apache instance for which we collect metrics data.
* `labels`: The `env` label controls the `environment` attribute. The default value is `production`.

For more about general configuration structure, see [Configuration](/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/host-integration-configuration-overview).

### Activate remote monitoring

The `remote_monitoring` parameter enables remote monitoring and multi-tenancy for this integration.

Activating `remote_monitoring` may change some attributes and/or affect your configured alerts. For more information, see [remote monitoring in on-host integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/remote-monitoring-host-integrations).

<Callout variant="important">
  Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher is required to use `remote_monitoring`.
</Callout>

### Environment variable passthroughs

Environment variables can be used to control config settings, and are then passed through to the infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see [Configure the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent#passthrough).

<Callout variant="important">
  With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see [Secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Find and use data

Data from this service is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).

Apache data is attached to the `ApacheSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data

The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as `net.` or `server.`.

## Inventory data

Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the `config/apache` namespace. For more about inventory data, see [Understand data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

## System metadata

Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the `ApacheSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "180px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.version`
      </td>

      <td>
        The version of the Apache server. Example: `Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Troubleshooting

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="https-access"
    title="Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache"
  >
    If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions:

    * Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters `ca_bundle_file` and `ca_bundle_dir` to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example:

      ```
      instances:
      	- name: apache-server-metrics
      command: metrics
      arguments:
      	status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto
      	ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle
      ```

      An example using `ca_bundle_dir`:

      ```
      ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl
      ```
    * Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
