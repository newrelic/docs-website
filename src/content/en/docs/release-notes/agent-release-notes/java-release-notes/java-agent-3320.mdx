### Improvements

* WebLogic

  This release adds official support for WebLogic versions 12.2.x
* Performance Improvements

  Improvements in Java agent startup time, particularly on modular ClassLoader architectures (such as JBoss)

### Fixes:

* Fixed bug in spymemcached instrumentation that would incorrectly name segments in [transaction traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details) that contained “get-and-touch” operations.
* Improved Play 2.5 instrumentation

  * Fixed memory leak for large POST requests.
  * Fixed incorrect response times. Previously, large uploads could cause inflated response times.
  * The agent now tracks PlayRequestHandler and no longer shows the short-lived NettyDispatcher transactions.
* Fixed a bug that could cause cross application tracing to display URLs as “Unknown” in [transaction traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details) when the URL did not include the port number.
* Fixed a bug in Jetty 9.3 instrumentation where transactions were not reported and memory was leaked if an incoming async request was wrapped by a framework or Jetty itself.
