End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Updated hapi instrumentation to support the recently released v6.9.
* Fixed a bug where an invalid package.json could cause the agent to crash while it recursed through `node_modules` gathering version details.
* Properly name `other` SQL queries.

  Previously when the agent failed to parse SQL it would create a metric stating the database type, query type, and query table were all unknown. This has been changed to keep track of database type and create an appropriate `other` operation metric like other agents.
