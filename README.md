# docs.newrelic.com

Welcome! üëã  This is the repo for [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com). This repo contains all the source code and Markdown source files we use to build our docs site.

Read on to learn more about who we are and how you can contribute to the New Relic Docs site.

## We'd like your help

From the start, we've welcomed contributions from anyone at New Relic, not just writers. Now, we're open sourcing our docs to invite input from anyone at all. We credit our technical accuracy and comprehensive documentation to this openness.

In a sense, it's documentation as conversation. By making our docs open source, we hope to expand this conversation.

We're here working every day to improve our docs and we'd love to hear from you. Come join the conversation.

## Get started

On each page of our docs, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or [edit a page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/create-edit-content/#edit-doc).

### Create an issue

Issues are a quick way to give us feedback about our docs. We'll review your issue and follow up with you if we have any questions. You can create an issue to let us know when you find an error or notice something missing. You can also let us know about things you'd like to see. Go here to [create an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).

### Edit a page

If you'd like to get more directly involved, you can edit the docs yourself! Here's how:

1. Every doc page on docs.newrelic.com has an **Edit page** pencil button in the right sidebar and the footer. Click it to access GitHub and the source file for that doc page.
2. Make your changes, then click **Commit changes**. This will automatically create a fork in your GitHub account with the changes.
3. Finally, follow the prompts to create a pull request and submit your changes for review. 

From there our writers will check out your pull request, comment with any feedback, and merge your change.

If you'd like more information on how to edit our docs, read our [processes to create and edit content](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide/writing-guidelines/create-edit-content/). Additionally, our [Style guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide) will give you some insight into how we think about writing and documentation, as well as our flavor of Markdown. Reading the style guide is totally optional! Our writers are here to make sure everything is formatted and worded right. We're looking for your technical insight and knowhow. Let us handle the little details for you.

If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our [Contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests.

## üöß Contributing

We welcome contributions to the New Relic Docs Site. Please review our [Contributors Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) prior to submitting any code.

Keep in mind when you submit your pull request, you'll need to sign the CLA via the click-through using CLA-Assistant. You only have to sign the CLA one time per project. If you have any questions, or to execute our corporate CLA, required if your contribution is on behalf of a company, please drop us an email at opensource@newrelic.com.
