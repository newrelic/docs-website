# docs.newrelic.com

Welcome! 👋  This is the repo for the `NEW` New Relic Docs site. This repo contains all the Docs website source code and Markdown source files we use to build our Docs site: `docs.newrelic.com`.

Read on to learn more about who we are and how you can contribute to the New Relic Docs site.

## We'd like your help

From early on, our Docs site has been managed by a team of writers. We've always welcomed contributions from anyone at New Relic and now we're open sourcing our docs to invite input from anyone at all. We credit our technical accuracy and comprehensive documentation to this openness.

In a sense, it's documentation as conversation. By making our docs open source, we hope to expand this conversation. Open sourcing our docs seemed like a great way to expand this conversation beyond New Relic.

We're here working every day to improve our docs and we'd love to hear from you. Come join the conversation.

## Get started

On each page of our docs, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose) or [edit a page](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Create an issue

Issues are a quick way to give us feedback about our docs. We'll review your issue and follow up with you if we have any questions.
You can create an issue to let us know when you find an error or notice something missing. You can also let us know about things you'd like to see.
Go here to [create an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).

### Edit a page

If you'd like to get more directly involved, you can make some changes yourself. On any doc page on docs.newrelic.com, you'll find a **Edit this page** button. Click it to get started making a change. This will take you to Github and the source file for that doc page. 
You can edit the source file directly by clicking on the pencil icon. This will automatically create a fork for you so you can make your edits, add a commit message, and propose the changes. Finally, create a pull request to submit the changes for review. 
If you'd like to go deeper, see our [Contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests.

Our [Style guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/style-guide) will give you some insight into how we think about writing and documentation, as well as our flavor of Markdown.

Reading the style guide is totally optional! Our writers are here to make sure everything is formatted and worded right. We're looking your technical insight and knowhow. Let us handle the little details for you.

## 🚧 Contributing
