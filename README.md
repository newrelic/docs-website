# docs.newrelic.com

The `docs-website` project is the code and data behind the new docs.newrelic.com. It is generated by Gatsby and built with the [`gatsby-theme-newrelic`](https://github.com/newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic).

### Dependencies

In order to run the project locally, you must have the following installed:

* [Node v12](https://nodejs.org/en/) (as specified in `.nvmrc`)
