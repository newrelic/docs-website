These procedures apply to iOS and tvOS apps using Cocoapods. For other types, see [iOS installation and configuration](/docs/mobile-monitoring-installation/ios-installation-and-configuration).

## Install your iOS application [#installation]

As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic.

To install and configure your iOS or tvOS application:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**.
2. (If applicable) From the **Mobile Apps** list, select **Add a new app**.
3. From the **Get Started** page, select **iOS** as the platform for mobile monitoring.
4. Type a name for your mobile app, then select **Continue**.

Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring.

## Configure using Objective-C [#objective-c]

These procedures to configure your iOS/tvOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the **Get Started** page in New Relic.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the **Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, include the New Relic header:

   ```
   #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h>
   ```
5. In your `AppDelegate.m` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@"APP_TOKEN"];
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     The agent must be on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>
6. Add a build script to your target's **Build Phases**. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):
     
- For iOS agent 7.4.0 or higher:
   ```   
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
 - For iOS Agent 7.3.8 or lower:
   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
 - OPTIONAL: Add the following lines to your build script above the existing lines to skip symbol upload during debugging:
    ```
    if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
        echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
        exit 0
    fi
    ```
7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or on another device.

## Configure using Swift [#configuration]

These procedures to configure your iOS/tvOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the **Get Started** page in New Relic.

1. In the **Podfile** for your project, add the following line:

   ```
   pod 'NewRelicAgent'
   ```
2. Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the terminal in your project directory:

   ```
   pod install
   ```
3. Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the terminal in your project directory:

   ```
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```
4. In your `AppDelegate.swift`, add the New Relic header:
   (If your app is written in SwiftUI, follow these [instructions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/troubleshoot/swiftui-appdelegate) to add an AppDelegate to your project.)

   ```
   import NewRelic
   ```
5. In your `AppDelegate.swift` file, add this call as the first line of `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):

   ```
   NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:"APP_TOKEN")
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()`, and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later (on a background thread or asynchronously) can cause unexpected or unstable behavior.
   </Callout>
6. Add a build script to your target's build phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing `APP_TOKEN` with your [application token](/docs/mobile-apps/viewing-your-application-token):
     
 - For iOS agent 7.4.0 or higher:
   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name run-symbol-tool | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
 - For iOS agent 7.3.8 or lower:
   ```
   SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find "${SRCROOT}" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1`
   /bin/sh "${SCRIPT}" "APP_TOKEN"
   ```
 - OPTIONAL: Add the following lines to your build script above the existing lines to skip symbol upload during debugging:
    ```
    if [ ${CONFIGURATION} = "Debug" ]; then
        echo "Skipping DSYM upload CONFIGURATION: ${CONFIGURATION}"
        exit 0
    fi
    ```
7. Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or on another device.

## Change the logging level (optional) [#logging]

By default the New Relic iOS agent will log at the `info` level. Increasing the log level to `verbose` or higher is only encouraged for debugging and not for release builds. 
Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring:

* `none`
* `error`
* `warning`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `ALL`

To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling `NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken)`:

```
[NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL];
```

For Swift apps:

```
NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue)
```
